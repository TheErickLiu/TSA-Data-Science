[$TSLA Earnings Thread,;,; Gross margins continue to shrink, down -612 bp yoy to 17.6%, also down sequentially from 17.9% last quarter. Operating margins are even worse, down -784bp yoy to 8.2%. Looks like all those price cuts are taking their toll. Not looking too good for TSLA in the EV rat race.  They lost market share in Europe compared to Q3 as well. The Chinese competition has gotten a lot more fierce in Europe lately, so this doesn't bode well for TSLA.  * Revenue: $25.17 billion (actual) vs $25.62 billion (estimated) * EPS: $2.27 (actual, GAAP) / $0.71 (actual, non-GAAP) vs $0.74 (estimated)  Earnings release: [https://ir.tesla.com/#quarterly-disclosure](https://ir.tesla.com/#quarterly-disclosure),;,; 2024-01-24 21:15:54]
[Why TSLA is extremely undervalued,;,; I‚Äôll try to make this as short as possible for everyone. This is a bit more of a ‚Äúlonger term‚Äù DD post.  TSLA is being significantly undervalued for the upcoming Optimus humanoid bots. If you look at a couple of videos TSLA has released, these bots have gotten significantly better over the past few years and their capability will only exponentially grow.  Sure we‚Äôll start off with just a few extremely wealthy people having these bots, but Musk is planning to mass manufacture these things. A decade or so down the line, you‚Äôll be able to get your own robot maid for 10K a pop. Everyone and their grandma will have one to do mundane tasks for us. And there are no competitors to this. Creating a robot like this is extremely difficult, much less mass manufacturing them.   There are no competitors in the field and they won‚Äôt show up for years due to sheer difficulty of the task as a huge portion of creating these things are software. And TSLA will only get further ahead with time with their monopoly.  If TSLA is successful with Optimus, they will bring in trillions of revenue over the years, making 5 trillion market cap eventually seem fairly valued.   800B market cap today is undervalued.   Edit: it seems there are some understandably quite pessimistic pundits in the chat. This take on TSLA is obviously not definite, but it might help get you ahead of the curve when people start speculating on Optimus perhaps one, two, or even three years down the line. Successful or not when TSLA proceeds to release more and more information on production, stock price will begin to spike at the very least on anticipation.,;,; 2023-12-26 15:46:32]

Slowly people realize that it's a super high capex industry with very low margins, no matter how a car makes itself move, and "self driving", when it finally arrives from multiple manufacturers will decrease in cost to the consumer 50% YoY for years in a row (I paid $6,000 for GPS NAV in an S500 in 2000, by 2006 it was a $500 option in many cars).

[TSLA Calls vanquished my last hope. Had $1k 24 hours ago,;,; &amp;#x200B;  [Was up to 14.5k by end of March, lost most by April 8th](https://preview.redd.it/7n310o2il6db1.jpg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0eaf7ff963a84ec680528bddb1a343e25be7484b)  As the picture shows, i'm down pretty bad. Started in December with just $800 and quickly got addicted to putting my savings in thinking its gonna multiply through easy puts. I honestly wasted all my savings within the first two months not knowing what i was doing, went from $6,800 to $600 to $1,200, and from there starting in March I actually did some good plays day by day on SPY and QQQ. I was calling reversals and everything, but the market also just had a lot of momentum. I reached 14.5k, the most money I've ever had at one time, and thought, dang just $500 more to 15k. I switched from my winning strategy of intraday plays and tried holding UVXY calls, Kroger and Zilllow puts (someone posted here about them) and lost a majority of my money by trying to do the same intraday calls/puts. But in April the market stabilized like crazy, my plays didn't work at all anymore and those puts I had lost so much value. I should have stopped but I got desperate, trying to regain my wealth. Honeslt,y if I had just waited three days and took a break, placed it all in Calls, I would easily have gone above $32k and probably not need to ever touch the market again.  I went to Coachella and missed out on a lot of earnings that i DID want to play, which probably would have boosted me really good. Instead the one Earnings i did play was Amazon. Price went from around 108 to 119 to 102 by open, we all remember that. I stayed outta playing for a bit, got my money up to $700 doing SQQQ puts recently, and then Put in another $300 to buy two Tesla calls at different prices for 7/28. 1k wiped out overnight.   Dumb and stupid choice, I really believed Tesla could break $305. My other friends only played $200-300, buy my dumbass went all in. Seeing 1k again felt so good for a moment. I really dont know what i'm going to do now. I have a lot of debt and basically 0 savings, all my money is just in my checking account going in and out as I get paid. I'm 24 but I feel like a fucking loser cause of all of this. At one point I wanted to take out a $2,500 loan but I was denied.,;,; 2023-07-20 20:54:33]

This move, aimed at concealing specific investments from public knowledge, suggests a strategic play by CEO Warren Buffett to continue acquiring shares without influencing the stock price. Such tactics allow Berkshire to amass significant positions at lower costs, given that any disclosed investment by Berkshire often leads to a surge in the stock's price as investors rush to emulate Buffett's moves. This scenario unfolds as Berkshire Hathaway navigates the complexities of the current financial landscape, leveraging its considerable influence and capital to optimize its investment strategy.  I have a theory that the secret accumulation of Tesla shares by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, if true, could represent a significant shift in Buffett's investment strategy, recognizing the tech and automotive sectors' transformative potential. This move could symbolize a meeting of minds between Buffett and Elon Musk, particularly with Musk's engagement in the Giving Pledge, initiated by Buffett. The potential synergy could redefine investment philosophies toward tech enterprises and forecast the impact of autonomous driving on the insurance industry, notably affecting Berkshire's Geico. This theory suggests a future where Musk's tech innovation and Buffett's investment savvy might reshape the automotive and insurance landscapes, especially in auto insurance risk management in the autonomous vehicle era.  I wouldn't put it past Buffett's team to be running a secretly coordinated campaign to negatively impact Tesla's narrative and share price. The coordinated stories of recalls that are merely software updates could be one example of this strategy. This approach would not only serve to depress Tesla's stock price, allowing Berkshire Hathaway to accumulate a more significant share at a lower cost but also exemplify the lengths to which Buffett's team might go to secure a strategic advantage in the market. This calculated move would underscore the depth of strategy employed by Berkshire Hathaway, manipulating market perceptions to favor their investment goals.,;,; 2024-02-15 14:24:00]

[Is TSLA going to repeat history,;,; Yes, I am well aware that the past does not predict the future. However, it sometimes does.   This is also a purely curious thought. Do not treat this as advice or anything that might indicate a suggestion.  Tesla's Q1 earnings call happened on April 19th. The stock dropped exactly 9.75% on the following day  As most of you know, Tesla's Q2 earnings happened yesterday afternoon. Today, the stock dropped 9.74%.  Am I the only one who finds it super strange that the market acted pretty much identically to Q1 earnings? literally within 0.01%  So, could this coincidence lead to a potential opportunity? if the market reacts the same way it did to Q1 then we would see around a 15% drop in prices (14.76% after Q1) before the stock hops back on the bull train that we have been accustomed too. in this probably delusional scenario in which the past is near perfectly replicated in the future, it would take TSLA around 1 month to reach pre-earnings price level. after reaching the pre-earnings level, Tesla jolted up 45% and caused CNBC hosts to have an overvaluation aneurysm.  There could also be something to say about opportunities involving volatility trades based on this correlation, but i'm too lazy to look into or think about that   This is more of a thought than anything else, just something to potentially discuss. Do not extract from this that it will play out the exact same way it did a couple months ago  (in full disclosure, i FOMOd into 2 TSLA 45dte callls at the 290 strike 2 days ago, will be bagholding this hoping past predicts future. no this is not personal confirmation bias.

[Tesla and TSLA,;,; I have written about TSLA before. They are in a very strong position. The only thing holding TSLA back is that Elon has apparently gone insane.  Tesla is still the strongest EV maker by far. They are sold out for months and months depending on the model and market. Their energy division grows in the background, and nobody notices. Other EV makers talk big, but do not have the battery supply chains. They can't make enough EVs to matter.  (See Back Ground posts below. For some reason, Reddit won't let me post the links. )  What really matters is the PE ratio and growth. I have written about this before in the above posts. Right now, it is about 57. Which really isn't that high for a company that is doing such huge growth. They made 1.3 million vehicles in 2022. But they are already as of now, at a production rate of 1.7million vehicles. By the end of 2023, it will be even higher. A company doing a 35% to 40% YoY growth rate is not at all high to have a 57 PE ratio.  &amp;#x200B;  **Edit: Here is the TLDR,**  **6 million cars per year leads to a $2.1 Trillion Market Cap with a very reasonable PE ratio.**   **---6million cars per year x margin of $12K per car = 72Billion.**   **---72B x reasonable PE ratio of 30 = $ 2.1Trllion**  **This ignores supercharger fees, robotaxi nonsense, energy sector, solar, subscriptions, etc**  **(They already have very good margins on their cars. Reuters says $15K per car already)**  &amp;#x200B;  From a Post in 2021  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  &amp;#x200B;  Tesla Stock still has huge growth potential.  Listen up fellow apes. I will try to make this short and simple. I believe TSLA is headed towards a $2T Market Cap.  **PE Ratio**  The PE Ratio measures current share price relative to its per-share earnings. This reflects how much an investor is willing to pay for earnings.  For a company not rapidly expanding, a normal P/E ratio is around 20:1. The average PE for the S&amp;P is something like 15.  We have all read about TSLA having an insanely high PE ratio in the past. That was before they started making over $1B per quarter.  Now the PE ratio is lower, but still very high.  TSLA is currently around a PE of 112 for forward earnings. The stock costs \~$650 per share. And the earnings per share were $1.45 for Q2.  So 650/ (1.45 x 4 quarters) = A forward PE of about 110.  (I am multiplying by the most recent Q2 and assuming the earnings are the same going forward for the sake of simplicity in this example)  Another way is to take annual earnings and the total market cap of the company. Their recent earnings were about $1.14B in Q2. So assume $4.56Billion for the next year.  $622B market cap / 4.56B annual earnings = PE ratio of \~135  This is with them making around 200,000 vehicles per quarter in Q2 2020. Or an annualized rate of just over 800,00 vehicles per year. Just doing an average of 1.14Billion / 200,000 gives us about $5,000 "per car". This ignores the energy sectors and software, solar, etc. Just a point of reference for an average.  **Future**  Does anyone expect Tesla to be standing still for the next few years?  Of course not.  With Berlin and Texas coming online, Tesla may reach 900,000 cars this year. In 2022 they will likely be well over 1.5million cars per year. So let's assume that by 2024 they are making 3 million cars per year.  3,000,000 cars x $5,000 per car = $15Billion per year in earnings.  How about with $8,000 per car?  =$24Billion  $24Billion x 30 = $720Billion Market Cap  How about a PE ration of 50. Since this seems like something investors have had no trouble tolerating over the life of TSLA's stock.  $24B x 50 = $1.2T Market Cap.  Let's try that again for 2028  Assume 6million cars per year and profits of $12,000 per car as efficiencies ramp up across all sectors.  This gives an annual earnings of $72B.  ((-Again, this sort of ignores the energy sector, software potential, etc.  \-Just the $10/month that Tesla charges for premium connectivity will become a high margin revenue generator. Around 2023 or 2024 Tesla will have about 5million cars on the road being charged the monthly cost.  $120/year x 5,000,000 cars = $600,000,000 per year in mostly profit.  \-The Supercharger costs to other Automakers could also become a huge revenue generator. ))  **A PE ratio of 30 on $72B is $2.1T**  This would be a stock price around $2200 per share.  If Investors are willing to tolerate a higher PE, then the Market Cap could hit 2T much sooner.  **Other Notes**  It is worth considering that if the stock gets into the Low $1,000s, Tesla may split it again. When it was announced last time there was a massive increase in the stock price before the split. It went from the low 1,000s to the mid $2,000s. The Mid $2,000s would be a Market Carp \~ $2T.  Edit: No matter what you think about 'FSD', it should be easy for everyone to accept that once Tesla gets FSD approved in a single jurisdiction, the stock will also jump through the roof. It doesn't matter if it will be in 2022, 2023, or 20XX, etc. I left that out since it is a whole separate discussion. And is not needed for my math of a $2T market cap.  Don't listen to me. Ignore my assumptions. Invest in Banana futures.  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  Another Older Post  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  Greetings fellow simians and proto-simians,  I wrote a post a while back that got some interest about being long TSLA.  I won't rehash the $2T market cap position. This post will go over various points of Tesla's advantages or disadvantages in support of a $2T market cap and overall value as a company and stock. HODL until 2024, stock price or year.  This may come across as the rantings of a mad-man. But I will try to make it coherent.  Notes:  1. All this will be done without a realization of FSD. That will have a huge change on stock price as soon as it is approved in a single jurisdiction. 2. Also, Please note, that once TSLA gets into the low thousands, another Stock Split is likely. Last time a stock split was announced the price went from the low $1,000s to the low $2,000s by the time of the Split.  **Tesla Advantages**  A) Tesla has more battery supply contracts.No other company can come close to Tesla on quantity or KWHr/$ cost for battery packs.(VW has substantial contracts. But even then, it seems unlikely their vendors will be able to actually obtain enough raw material supply.)For Example, the moron Executives at Ford did not even realize that the EV Battery Supply for the world was already contracted out for Years.  B) Software/Over the Air........In 2021, not even VW can figure this out.  C) Software based UI  Less buttons, cables, supply chain.The cost is in the supply chain.People think the minimalist interior of the 3 and Y are driven by Elon's ego. But really, the less stuff = less costs. Less install, less holding and supply costs, less wires, etc etc.The lack of traditional air vents might look cool, but it is really about having less parts.  D) Supercharger Network.Tesla has the largest charging network in the World. This is a huge revenue generator and asset for Tesla Owners.  E) Tesla Sells more EVs in North America/US than all the other OEMs put together...... x 4.[https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020](https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020)  F) If you count road trip capable EVs, (can charge fast enough) Tesla sells over 90%.The crappy leafs and bolt type EVs cannot charge fast enough for a road trip.  G) People hate car dealerships more than the Dentist for a lot of reasons. People like buying things online and not having to interact with other humans. Besides just being able to order online, with a Tesla, you can see the actual price of the actual car. That is the price. It is nearly impossible to get an actual out-the-door price from a legacy dealer until the final paperwork for the car.As consumers become more and more aware of this, it will be a sales advantage for Tesla.  H) The potential EV market is huge.  Every Dinosaur OEM is always stunned when their EV offerings sell out in minutes. People want EVs. Tesla is not really competing against other EVs. They are taking sales of dinosaur ICE sales.  G) Tesla Engineers in different areas work together. In a normal OEM world, the radiator team does not work with the regen-break team. Tesla staff do work together. So there is less bulk and unneeded parts in Tesla products.  H) The "Model 2" is likely to be announced soon. This is the cheaper compact EV expected to be made and marketed in China.  I) All Teslas are capable of Road Trips.(Big Enough Battery, Efficient enough Mileage, Fast Enough Charge Rate miles per minutes charging). Not to mention robust enough charging network.  J). Right now, it is very difficult in the lower 48 to be more than 75 miles from a Tesla Supercharger. It is also very difficult to be on an expressway and be more than 50miles from a Supercharger. This is a huge asset and Tesla is already there now. Not in a few years.[https://supercharge.info/map](https://supercharge.info/map)  K) Seamless Supercharging.Have you ever used a non-Tesla fast charger? The process is awful. The stalls might be broken, they don't handshake with the car, the payment doesn't work etc. They are in shopping parking lots instead of along major travel routes.  **Disadvantages**  A) Non-FSD chip Supply(Shouldn't affect Tesla more than any other OEM. But may have more airtime in the media due to FUD spreaders)  B) FUD in the media. Example: Jalopnik has a huge audience. But they can't print an accurate story about Tesla if their lives depended on it. Reading the Jalopnik comments on a Tesla Story is like listening to conspiracy rants from the Capitol Rioters. Tesla gets them clicks. Printing something sensational gets clicks. Here is an example. Many outlets, including Jalopnik, recently reported that Tesla finally made a profit without Reg Credits (pollution emission credits). Except that Tesla has made a profit in the past without Reg Credits. It is hard to believe someone writing an article could be this bad at math and research. Taxes are paid on income from Reg Credits. So you have to subtract both the income AND the taxes on that income if you want to know Tesla's Quarterly balance sheet without Reg Credits. \*\* Math Below  **Other OEMs are mostly Morons**  A) Ford has paired with SK to make a factory that can make 125GWHrs per year.....in 2025.This is a decent amount of battery supply. But again, this is really only enough Batteries for &lt;2 million cars annually...by 2025. And this is if they can even get the supply contracts for raw materials. Tesla Will be making 2 Million electric cars per year by the middle of 2023 if not sooner.  B) Most other electric cars in North America are still compliance nonsense like the Bolts.  B1) The Bolts are really just there to sell Silverados. The Bolts can't fast charge enough for a road trip. The Bolts catch fire and have recalls that aren't reported much in the news. Could you imagine if Tesla told people to stop charging their vehicles indoors or unattended? There would be articles calling for Blood.  B2) The MachE is a good car spec wise. (It really is a compliance car for the EU though)But was clearly designed by a company that is Silo'd. Meaning the engineering groups do not work together. Sandy Munro - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU)  B3) There are only a handful of non-Tesla electric cars in North America in models and total quantity that can actually charge fast enough for non-local driving. Most of these are pricey. It is Q3 2021. Selling an EV that can only charge at 150KW peak charge rate is a joke. Even the ID4 is more like 125KW.  C) GM appears to be MoronsThese people paired with Nikola. How dumb could a company be?Anyone who follows the EV space knew that Nikola was vaporware long before the latest fraud accusations.  [https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/)  D) Tesla is sold out for Months. (2022 forfor some)This is a great problem to have in most circumstances. If you want a Tesla in 2021, you should be ordering it now.  E) There are something like 1.2 million Cybertruck reservations.  Even if only half of those turn into actual orders, that is still $40 Billion in revenue.  Presumably more and more orders will come in once deliveries start being made and people see them in person.[https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html](https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html)  For comparison, the F150 lighting has about 150,000 reservations/orders. Which is great. Except that Ford has no battery supply to deliver most of these for the next several years.  F. Toyota is still Gaslighting us about Hydrogen.

People think a common parts bin is an asset. It mostly is not. If you are designing common EVs, then yes sure, a common parts bin makes sense. But what it really has done to most offerings from Dinosaur OEMs has forced decisions that were based on the part; not the design need. See Sandy Munro videos for examples. But the MachE is a good example.  **Ranting about Hydrogen Fuel Cells**  ZZ) Hydrogen is for snake oil for Gaslighting morons. Most people think that Hydrogen is burned in Fuel cells cars. HFCs actually work like this: You put a bunch of energy into making, storing, and transporting hydrogen, then later, you get a small small amount of that energy back. Each KG of Hydrogen created will produce about 9KG of C02. (before accounting for storage and transport)[https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/)  \*\* TSLA Q3 2020 Example  [https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/)  People who spread that myth are not recognizing that taxes are paid on reg credit income.Reg credits have taxes paid on them.  Less Income = Less Taxes.Income from Reg Credits is taxed.  555 income before taxes186 paid in taxes= about 34% tax rate  If people claim that they only made a profit from regulatory credits, then subtract out regulatory credits AND the taxes paid on them.555 - 397= \~158  158 \* tax rate of 34% or so = 53milli in taxes  158-53mil in taxes = over 100mil in profit.  The point being they have made a profit in previous quarters without reg credits. It is just that most journalists are too lazy to understand math.  As always, don't listen to me.

Since IV is quit high for options play in SMCI and NVDIA, if the prices tanked we will not see Put or Call gains. However some regards sugested to go with QQQ, trying to capture the NVDIA movement, I did some charts and from my regardness ( I cant read candles, only YOLO charts), my points are summarized bellow:  1. TSLA:  There is a likelihood that TSLA can be rebound if the market start to sell-of NVDIA after the ER. The chart shows migration from TSLA to NVDIA in January.  2. QQQ : seems does not capture the moves of NVDIA, by the chart presented.  3. PLTR: keep the same NVDIA moviment, if one goes down the other goes too...  4.TSM: looks like after Feb/07 investors also have migrate to NVDIA. But TSM also can follow the NVDIA's patterns post ER.  5. SMCI: this crazy rocket since Jan/17 has it own move ...and the NVDIA results or moves can affect only by fear of wich were happened to SMCI (my gues, I am not an expert).  Any thoughts? Something that I missed or my ape brain could not figure out ?  Disclaymer : I have positions in MSFT and AAPL - calls and both are red :(), Put on COIN and Put on CSCO.  But I am considering buying some Calls on TSLA for DTE 03/15, Put on PLTR and TSM.

[TSLA more US price cuts,;,; This is pretty early in the quarter to be seeing price cuts. Pretty soon you apes can afford one.  https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cuts-prices-us-spur-demand-2023-04-07/  April 7 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) has slashed prices of its electric vehicles in the United States, its website showed on Thursday, doubling down on a discount drive against the backdrop of a weakening economy.  The cuts ranged from 1.9% on the performance version of the Model 3 to 5.6% on the basic version of the Model S. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reductions.  The move follows repeated comments in recent months by Chief Executive Elon Musk that Tesla would focus on lowering prices to spur demand and had seen success in sparking orders with global discounts introduced in January.  Tesla has cut prices on both versions of its Model S. The price of the basic version was cut by 5.6% to $84,990, while the price of the performance, Plaid variant was cut by 4.5% to $104,990.  Prices of both the performance and basic variants of Model 3 cars were cut by $1,000, the website showed. The price of the basic version of the Model 3 was cut by 2.3% to $41,990 while its performance version was cut by 1.9% to $52,990.,;,; 2023-04-07 06:22:32]

[Tesla's $TSLA humanoid Optimus robots have option value today,;,; How does one analyze a business segment that could have Trillions (with a T) of dollars in annual revenue in the year 2050? A discounted cash flow model is the way to go, but the problem is that small changes in the assumptions make huge differences in the outcome. However, in the case of Tesla's humanoid robot offering Optimus, the size of the price is so incredibly large that one can make extremely conservative assumptions and still end up with meaningful option value. I say extremely conservative, except for the main assumption...  Anyone following the hype around humanoids knows that someone predicted that there could be a a total of a billion humanoids in about 20 years, and then Elon Musk gave that notion a thumbs up. At first blush a billion humanoids seems absurd, but that's because one thinks of humanoids as humans, when in fact they're machines. Also, one might think of the claims made about autonomous vehicles, and shrug off a billion humanoids.   Again, it sounds crazy, right? But there will be 10s of millions of EVs being produced a year later this decade. If one thinks of a humanoid as no more complex than an EV, then one can see how it's likely that there will in fact be a billion humanoids *SOME DAY*. The question is, will it be by 2040, 2050, or 2060? I choose 2050, and I assume Tesla sells a total of 177M (an arbitrary # based on ramping up in my model to 6M units in 2033, then increasing sales by 5%/yr. through 2050).   In some ways that's a conservative assumption, because if Tesla gets to 6M units/yr., there's no reason to assume it will only grow 5%/yr. However, the BIG assumption is that 10s or even 100's of millions of humanoids will be ~~rolling~~ walking off assembly lines. The stumbling block is not the hardware, that will be perfected by Tesla and others this decade. The AI embedded in the robot is critical. Humanoids will be in the workforce this decade. In my model, by 12/31/29 there will be 637,572 humanoids working around the world.   There are billions of jobs that humanoids can eventually perform, so 637,572 humanoids is a drop in the bucket. Here's where more conservatism kicks in again, what price will Tesla sell Optimus bots for? I assume before long Elon Musk will be giving them away for free -- the razor/razor blade model. This tremendous opportunity for Tesla and others will center around leasing bots and charging for software/AI, the brains of Optimus. How much could Tesla lease worker drones for?   Well, humans cost \~$36/hr. (incl. benefits) in factories, warehouses &amp; assembly line work. If Tesla charged owners **$3/hr.,** per bot, the savings to manufacturers could be **\~$28/hr.** per job (factories have overhead and there would be consumables, lubricants, parts, electricity, batteries, etc.). So, at $3/hr./bot, Tesla's revenue would grow to over **$2.5 Trillion dollars** in 2050, *(from humanoids alone),* b/c it would be earning $3hr. on 177M ***cumulative*** Optimus bots in circulation by 2050. Okay, that $2.5 Trillion needs to be discounted back to today.   And, what about cap-ex to design, develop &amp; construct factories to build 177M humanoids buy 2050? I factor all that in by assuming an incredibly large total cap-ex hurdle of **$60B** from 2024-2034. Why is that figure likely to be very conservative? Tesla's Optimus units will share costs across Tesla's platforms. They could be built in or around existing &amp; planned giga-factories, the software/AI in Optimus will be the same as that used in Tesla's EVs.   To recap, Tesla will eventually be giving away humanoids, and charging $3/hr./bot to lease them, and the Optimus segment will cost a total of **$60B** through 2034. Discounting cash flows back at a 10% discount factor, the NPV(10%) is **\~$3.5T** or \~**$1,093/share**, vs. Tesla's current share price of **\~$190**. Let's say there's a 10% chance Tesla will sell 177M humanoids by 2050. Then, the option value of the opportunity is $1,093 x 10%  = **$109.3/shr**. And, if Tesla doesn't sell 17.7% of the first billion humanoids, perhaps it will sell 10% of 2 billion humanoids by 2060...   What if Tesla is not a leader in humanoids? That's possible, but it has so much cash to deploy vs. start-ups that it can and will buy other companies. Other large companies will come to own large shares of the market as well by rolling up robotics companies &amp; start-ups. There are about 8-10 global automakers that dominate 90% of sales. Tesla should be among the 8-10 that dominate 90% of the humanoid market. ,;,; 2024-02-15 05:30:56]

[RIVN today is like TSLA in 2019, don't miss this boat 50+ by 2025,;,; # My history on $TSLA  When tesla first launched the model 3, seeing in person reservations line throughout the mall, I started really looking into Tesla stock, fast forward to 2019, I went all in (and made this reddit account: TSLA4LIFE1), I sold some pre-COVID rally and model 3, but quickly re-bought during the downturn, and then sold some after first split to put it into WSB's favourite stock of 2021.  # Current problems with TSLA  Coming to today, I'm starting to see lots of similarity in $RIVN both on the numbers and valuation side, and also on the products, innovation, feedback, and demand side. There is no doubt $TSLA has been struggling and just offering price cuts to justify selling basically the same model 3 from 2018 in 2023. What was way ahead of the competition in 2018, is now barely on par, thus needing price cuts to justify the purchase.  # RIVN Demand  Rivian on the other hand, cant produce enough of their first vehicle - R1T, let alone the crazy demand, wait, and hype for the full sized SUV - R1S. Their products consistently get good reviews, have great quality, and are like nothing on the market.  Rivians are not only praised as top of the line tech, but also praised as amazing vehicles by Car enthusiasts, which is something Tesla always lacked.  &amp;#x200B;  # RIVN Stock  So we have shown above that RIVN is a good company with good products, but is it a good stock? A good stock is a good company at a GOOD price.  &amp;#x200B;  $Rivn was hit heavily with their recent news of offering $1.5 Billion of converting debt, which is maturing 2030. The stock is since down massively due to people thinking this was out of the blue, but as previously communicated this was expected sometime in 2024.  &amp;#x200B;  Looking into the above I wanted to take a look at how RIVN was currently valued compared to TSLA:  [RIVN vs TSLA P\/S ratio](https://preview.redd.it/2p7ol800h7vb1.png?width=1402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b863bd29d2d37c264486bacdfe07a85d078749a)  &amp;#x200B;  For pre income and heavy growth companies (RIVN today and 2019 TSLA) it always makes sense to use P/S ratio (MKT Cap/Revenue), and as seen above, from this metric currently the market has a 50% discount on RIVN compared to TSLA.  &amp;#x200B;  # Cash on hand  &amp;#x200B;  [RIVN vs TSLA Cash on hand](https://preview.redd.it/qwax3jl0h7vb1.png?width=1354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=67f9f20bf65a371b243174fc494b2382e482dd7e)  &amp;#x200B;  RIVN has a MKT cap of $**16.512B** and cash on hand of $10.2B, compared to TSLA's MKT cap of $**692.374B** and cash on hand of $23B, so a 42x bigger MKT cap, but only 2x the cash on hand. This eliminates fear of further needing to raise cash for a while, and further strengthens RIVN's valuation vs TSLA.  &amp;#x200B;  # Revenue growth vs. margin growth  Rivn is growing revenues faster than tesla, while their COGS is going up less than Tesla, now what does this mean? -&gt; Better margins. Although still negative for RIVN, they are on the right track, and even as ELON keeps blaming the current macro environment, RIVN is dealing with the same macro, yet somehow increasing their top and bottom lines at a better pace then TSLA  &amp;#x200B;  # Price targets and how long to hold  Now RIVN still has a long way to go, and I'm not trying to justify nor buying RIVN for the long term. I see the stock at a discount currently, but also realize it has room to fall back to mid teens. However, on the upside, I can see a massive run of 50+ before 2025, which is what my target is.  Many people got married to Tesla, which went from a good to great company, while the stock went from attractive, to extremely overvalued. Yet, many initial investors fell into the trap on not realizing that great companies as shit prices are shit stocks.  &amp;#x200B;  I will keep increasing my position on the way down, and start legging out profits at $50+  &amp;#x200B;  Current positions:  23% of my port value at $21.3178 avg cost.

Any downside from here would just be to make the premiums cheaper I feel like to run it up more in the next few weeks / month max.

[$TSLA to 12 trillion AI DD inside,;,; ChatGPT said so:  TLDR: As of September 2021, Tesla's market cap was around $750 billion, and Apple's (highest market cap in the world) was around $2.4 trillion, making Tesla's market cap about 31.25% of Apple's. Around late 2007 or early 2008, Apple's market cap was approximately 31% of Exxon Mobil's (highest market cap in the world - at that time). Apple's market cap has grown by an estimated 1,500% since 2007. If Tesla's market cap were to grow by the same percentage, its future market cap would hypothetically **be around $12 trillion.**    Q: What's the most recent stock price data you have?  A: As an AI language model, I don't have real-time data access or any data beyond September 2021. To obtain the most recent stock price information, please refer to financial news websites, brokerage platforms, or financial market data providers such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or Bloomberg.  Q: As of your most recent data: 1) what is the market cap of tesla?  2) What is the market cap of tesla as a ratio compared to aapl's market cap?  A: As of my most recent data in September 2021:  1. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) had a market capitalization of around $700 billion - $800 billion. Please note that this figure may have changed significantly since then. To get the current market cap, please check a reliable financial data source. 2. Apple Inc. (AAPL) had a market capitalization of around $2.4 trillion in September 2021. To calculate the ratio of Tesla's market cap to Apple's market cap at that time, you would divide Tesla's market cap by Apple's market cap. Using the approximate numbers provided:  (Tesla's market cap) / (Apple's market cap) = ($700 - $800 billion) / ($2.4 trillion)  Keep in mind that these figures are outdated and the ratio could be very different now. To get the most recent market cap data and ratio, please refer to an up-to-date financial data source.  Q: what does ($700 - $800 billion) / ($2.4 trillion) equal?  A: I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. To clarify, Tesla's market capitalization was between $700 billion and $800 billion, while Apple's was around $2.4 trillion. To find the approximate ratio, we can use the average of Tesla's market cap range:  ($700 billion + $800 billion) / 2 = $750 billion  Now, we can calculate the ratio:  (Tesla's market cap) / (Apple's market cap) = ($750 billion) / ($2.4 trillion)  Since 1 trillion equals 1,000 billion, we can convert Apple's market cap to billions:  ($750 billion) / (2,400 billion) ‚âà 0.3125  So, the ratio of Tesla's market cap to Apple's market cap was approximately 0.3125 or 31.25% based on the data from September 2021. Please note that these figures are outdated, and the ratio could be very different now. To get the most recent market cap data and ratio, please refer to an up-to-date financial data source.  Q: using historical data, 1) when was aapl's market cap ratio 31% compared to the most highest market cap company at that time?  2) what year and prices were they  A: It's challenging to pinpoint the exact date and price when Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) market cap was 31% of the highest market cap company at the time without access to an extensive historical database. However, I can provide a rough estimate based on available information.  In the mid-to-late 2000s, Exxon Mobil (XOM) was often the largest publicly traded company by market capitalization. Around the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008, Apple's market cap was approximately $150-$160 billion, while Exxon Mobil's market cap was around $500 billion.  Using these approximate values, we can calculate the ratio:  (Apple's market cap) / (Exxon Mobil's market cap) = ($150-$160 billion) / ($500 billion) ‚âà 0.30-0.32 or 30-32%  This suggests that Apple's market cap ratio was roughly 31% compared to Exxon Mobil in late 2007 or early 2008. Note that these are rough estimates, and the actual ratio may have varied slightly. Also, the share prices and market cap values might have been different on the exact day the ratio was 31%. For more accurate historical data, I recommend consulting financial databases or historical stock market records.  Q: what percentage gain in market cap has aapl experienced since 2007 compared to it's value in your most recent data?  What would TSLA's market cap be if it grew from it's present 750 billion market by that same % of growth in the future?  A: As of my most recent data in September 2021, Apple Inc. (AAPL) had a market capitalization of around $2.4 trillion. To provide an estimate of the percentage gain in market cap since 2007, let's use the approximate market cap of $150 billion from the end of 2007 as the starting point.  Percentage gain = ((Current market cap - Market cap in 2007) / Market cap in 2007) \* 100  Percentage gain ‚âà (($2,400 billion - $150 billion) / $150 billion) \* 100 ‚âà 1,500%  Now, let's use the average Tesla Inc. (TSLA) market cap value of $750 billion from my previous response and calculate what its market cap would be if it experienced the same percentage growth as AAPL:  Future market cap = Current market cap \* (1 + (Percentage gain / 100))  Future market cap = $750 billion \* (1 + (1,500% / 100)) = $750 billion \* (1 + 15) = $750 billion \* 16 ‚âà $12,000 billion or $12 trillion  If Tesla's market cap were to grow by the same 1,500% as Apple's did from 2007 to September 2021, its market cap would be approximately $12 trillion. Please note that this is a hypothetical scenario, and there's no guarantee that Tesla or any other company will experience the same growth rate as Apple.  &amp;#x200B;  Thank you for coming to my TedTalk,;,; 2023-04-13 03:16:48]

[TSLA Market Profile Recap and Look Ahead,;,; Hey all, I wanted to post my observations on TSLA after Friday's session from a Market Profile standpoint. If you didn't catch my post recapping the Thursday 10/12 session, you can [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/176qmfx/market_profile_analysis_on_tsla_going_into/).  From Thursday and previous sessions, we established a bearish outlook based on the TPO and Volume Profile charts. Friday's session acts as confirmation of that outlook.  The most significant indication of this is the change in interest at 258.9 from Thursday to Friday's session. On Thursday, 258.9 acted as a secondary point of control, as it was the peak of that lower distribution. This means that in that auction range, there was the most interest by both buyers and seller to trade at 258.9.  This sentiment changed as we quickly moved down from this price after the open and never traded back up. We also see acceptance at the lows, as that's where we spent most of our time trading.  We have a poor low and unlike the poor high from Thursday I expect this low to be revisited and broken pretty quickly. The reason being is because we lingered near the low for most of the day, as demonstrated by the value area encompassing the low.  This concept of breaking the poor high/low is called repair as it repairs the structure of the poor low that lacked symmetry without a proper ‚Äúbottom‚Äù.  I would also like to note that while I do not show the volume profile in my screenshot, I do find it important in accordance with the TPO chart. With TSLA over the last few days, the VP chart has been pretty consistent with the TPO structure, which just adds additional confidence to my thoughts.  Thanks for reading, and if you have any questions about this please let me know!

[Market Profile Analysis on TSLA going into Friday's Session,;,; I wanted to share some of my observations on TSLA from a TPO chart. Just some context on what a TPO chart exactly is -   TPO  stands for ‚ÄúTime Price Opportunity‚Äù. Each TPO, denoted by a single letter, represents a point of time where the security trades at a specific price.¬† A single TPO is printed on the chart every time that a certain price (in my example for TSLA each block is 10 cents) is touched during any time period.¬† Typically, the periods are set to 30 minutes.¬† Therefore, every different letter that you see in the  distribution denotes a different 30 minute period.   Basically we're analyzing the amount of trading activity, based on time. I also utilize a similar chart but for volume instead of time. Now to the analysis.   There's a few important takeaways for me from Thursday's session.   We created a poor high.  This is indicated by multiple letters at the high and a lack of a clear tail like we see for the 10-11 session highs. A "poor high" on a TPO chart indicates an abrupt halt in upward price movement, often lacking excess. It suggests an incomplete auction.  The poor high has two forward looking indications. The first is that prices should back away from the poor high as there are a number of longs trapped at poor location. The second is that if the next day or in some subsequent session, the poor high is revisited, then the odds are strong that it will break and move higher. This is called repair as it repairs the structure of the poor high that lacked symmetry without a proper ‚Äútop‚Äù.   We can also see that there was not much interest in trading around 260.40 - 260.90 range and a new distribution was setup lower at the close.    Based on afternoon trading, I prefer bears going into Friday's session. Bears will look to defend 260.90 and prevent the stock from trading into the original distribution. Target would be 255, as that is an area where we have spent a lot of time in last Friday and Monday's session.   The strategy is simply to play with the single prints as that is indicative of a lack of interest in that area and take profit near the highest point in the distribution, as we expect to spend a large amount of time trading in that area.

[Chanos Calls TSLA 'Overvalued': My Theta-Positive Strategy in Response,;,; Jim Chanos recently [labeled Tesla (TSLA) as "ridiculously overvalued"](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-09-14/chanos-calls-tesla-ridiculously-overvalued-video).  In today's frenzied market, one might wonder what isn't "ridiculously overvalued," especially within the tech sector and any mention of AI.  While I don't entirely align with Chanos's view on TSLA ‚Äì believing its stock might very well climb further ‚Äì I'm not banking on a meteoric rise to $400 solely on the back of AI chatter.  In times of uncertainty, a balanced approach can be invaluable. I've set up a ratio spread on both sides to capitalize on positive theta, allowing flexibility for future moves. Here's my play:  * Bought 3 Oct20 calls at a $270 strike * Bought 3 Oct20 puts at a $270 strike * Sold 9 Oct20 calls at a $320 strike * Sold 6 Oct20 calls at a $240 strike * Total Debit: $3432.9 * Collateral: $30,000.

[Learned what early assignment is today ü•≤,;,; Since I very clearly have no idea what I'm doing, I've been playing around with what I __thought__ were low risk spreads to get a feel for things. Ya know, like the ones that show a max profit of $5,000 and max loss of $5 - cause that's safe...right? ü´†   I obviously was not expecting to hit max profits on these by _any_ stretch of the imagination. Rather, I spent hours upon hours reading Robinhood's resources and scrolling through different strategy types, legs, strike prices, dates, etc trying to wrap my head around what I was looking at. Eventually, I decided I was content with paying a few bucks ($2 and $8 for these long put calendar spreads, to be exact) to see something through from start to end in real time. Spend $10 to get some hands on experience today, skip the Starbucks run tomorrow; no harm, no foul. Seemed totally logical at the time.   What _really_ tripped me up was the spreads with $0 cost. Completely mind boggling to me that a play could profit so much as $10 (let alone multiple thousands, if a miracle happened of course) without having to risk a single penny. Like why wouldn't everyone be doing that?!  Well... opening the app to find that I'd somehow managed to rack up more than $85,000 in debt in just a few hours obviously answered that question.

[Tesla is going to 100$ before November,;,;              Foreword- It‚Äôs literally marked as a discussion. Banning me forever on a minor technicality, on my first post, from my fave sub while admitting the post sparked good convo so you're going to leave it up feels low. I either added value to your community or I deserve to be banned, don‚Äôt see how it could possibly be both. I‚Äôd humbly ask the mods for a reconsideration and I apologize to the whole of the community for the mis flair.          Now sit down, shut the fuck up, grab half a sticky note and a pencil and let‚Äôs begin. I know there‚Äôs no way I explain this as elegantly as Margot Robbie in a bathtub so I‚Äôm betting on you degenerates rolling your eyes and carrying on, but I want to be able to say I called it in the future. Here goes nothing on my first and ig my only Wall Street bets post ever (thanks mods). Let‚Äôs make it a prophecy of biblical fucking proportions.           I believe a combination of fomo, unattainable  promises/deadlines , shit debit deals, unannounced shrinking margins, elons declining brand image, increasing competition, and overhyped delivery beats have sent Tesla to unrealistic and unsustainable heights. Im convinced that what‚Äôs toted as their greatest strengths could be their greatest weaknesses. Let‚Äôs start with the big one, fsd. Day after day Full FSD starts to look less likely in the near future, and when it does come I imagine it will be more of a legal and regulatory liability than a future asset. I can already smell the class actions from here in the past. (That‚Äôs more long term though). Short term for the 5th quarter in a row they‚Äôve made more cars then sold. That‚Äôs not a growth company. The Tesla truck (most hyped release of this year) is already 4 year old news and they have yet to start moving them. The WOW factor is no longer  there in consumers minds. You can only hype something up, miss all deadlines, and then underdeliver so often till people get wise. Competition from the F-150 lightning, rivian, lucid,  and others is not just catching up‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs here in teslas preverbal review mirrors.         Sure they sold an extra 5% cars, easy to do if you discount 35%. For market comparison ford cut 1%, GMs prices are UP 1%, and average car is down 4%. Many like to compare Teslas brand image to that of Apple. Apple never discounts their iPhones as that ruins the ‚Äúpremium feel‚Äù and buying experience of the product. It also leaves a bad taste in the mouths of everyone who bought at full price hurting future sales.         Let's not even start talking about the companies valuation compared to Toyota (enough has been said on that). It‚Äôs lunacy, fuelled by nothing but greed and pie in the sky goals for 2030. The amount of mental gymnastics Elon fanboys have to do to try and justify it is laughable. The fact that the man they're defending has even said the valuation is too high without full fsd and even then‚Ä¶. 800 billion. Jesus. Fucking. Christ. But I digress on that point as it‚Äôs been beat into the ground by others.          To add further uncertainty, a large amount of shares are also still being used as leverage for twitter funding. Twitter is going to hades and threads is the nail in the coffin. (Most downloads of an app in one day EVER). Musk responded by calling him a cuck. Real reassuring from your ceo that he has logical plan to beat this threat to his business and your investment. How long till he has to sell those shares to pay the creditors and service his debts thus tanking the price? I suspect his investors in the Middle East are getting antsy right about now. I belive his bad decisions that he tried to back out of are about to come out of your pocket Tesla bag holders.         The big catalyst? A very disappointing earnings report this month followed by a months long slide that ends around 120 in November. A big miss, a big one day drop, underwhelming trucks deliveries, twitter investors start demand shares, US rate hikes and Elons tweets will do the rest. Think internet crash of 1990, 2000 but with ai. The golden boy himself (musky the elk) already put out a warning against using margin on Tesla stock before earnings. (Got deleted very quickly, likely lawyers told him that was iffy to say). I wonder why he said it in the first place‚Ä¶ Maybe those discounts hurt profit margins a little more than the markets are currently betting on? Maybe a lot more‚Ä¶?        Many smarter and richer have tried to predict teslas downfalll and failed fantastically so read this with an enormous grain of salt. This is the complete OPPOSITE of investment advice, pls talk with your financial advisor to find out what‚Äôs best for your portfolio and goals. ( I‚Äôll save you some time, they‚Äôll advise against this). If at any point in reading this you considered taking up a put position with me  - pls stop, hit yourself in the head with a brick, and call this number - 1 800 GAMBLER         Time is money so thanks for letting me waste some of yours reading this and pls leave your insults /  criticism below for me to ignore!

So yes, it‚Äôs true tech specification wise, other car manufacturers are catching up and at this rate they might catch up in a few years in sales too. But Daddy Elon has an ace up his sleeve.  That ace is Tesla Self Driving. Full disclosure, I own a Tesla with FSD, and I own other cars and I can confidently say no other car manufacture is even attempting to do what Tesla is doing. The closest I‚Äôve seen is some videos of Chinese car manufacturers attempting something like Tesla, but the bottom line is Tesla is way ahead of the competition, rest of the competition is not even trying.   The only issue is that even though Tesla is way ahead, their product is kind of garbage. You can‚Äôt use it with any consistency so it makes no difference to the user experience with or without FSD. It certainly does not affect sales of Tesla cars in any significant way. But I have strong reason to believe this product will follow a trend like ChatGPT.   For all you regards who entered AI in the last year, you probably have no idea of the real history of OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT. It was not a linear continuous improvement. It was not we kept slowly getting better with our chatbot and finally it became good enough to become ChatGPT. No you see, it was a sudden step size improvement that shocked most researchers in the field. You see OpenAI released GPT1 which could barely spell correctly and seemed useful for pure research. Then OpenAI released GPT2 which had a lot of hype because researchers were ‚Äúafraid‚Äù of releasing it to the world and when we finally saw it, it tended to create grammatically ok sentences but most of the time it was incoherent and didn‚Äôt even make as much sense as a toddler. Then came GPT-3, at which point OpenAI was spending millions upon millions training this model. GPT3 and 3.5 seemed kinda useful if you prompted it really well. In fact many companies popped up that just prompted GPT3 really well and created text for copywriting etc, but a good 50%+ of the time you used to get nonsensical responses. It didn‚Äôt feel like you were talking to a human. There was a general feeling among researchers I spoke to, that this scaling experiment from OpenAI failed, there is a missing piece to human intelligence etc etc. Then suddenly came ChatGPT, it always held a conversation with you. Yes it could give you wrong answers, but it always gave answers that made sense, you understood what it was trying to convey to you. This proved OpenAI‚Äôs thesis that just scaling worked .   All this to say that it looks like the technology does not work until it just suddenly starts working. Tesla is now doing the same thing for FSD that OpenAI did, they are using pure scale, the human hand engineering has been pushed to a minimum. This in my view is the correct approach to self driving, and so in the coming year with the release of Version 12, the first end to end neural network trained Self driving model, I think they will have made the breakthrough needed to solve driving and the market has not priced this in. Version 12.1 has reportedly started going out to select customers, which is why I‚Äôm so confident that EoY is a good timeline for Tesla. It will be the second big revolution that occurs due to AI. 1T+ to me seems easy, much more likely to reach 2T+ eventually. My position right now is 10k in Tesla shares, will load up on calls as I hear more about Tesla V12,;,; 2024-01-22 01:13:10]

[Last month I was driving a Tesla. Today I just rode the bus to my job interview.,;,; So I was making really good trades at the beginning of the year. I had a Tesla id been leasing for over a year and was considerably well off. I got greedy making trades thinking "this was my shot" and took some huge losses back to back to back. Last month I kept taking loss after loss, so bad to where I had to start selling stuff to afford rent for my apartment. I ended up losing my job last month as well. Somehow im still in the green YTD on my webull (idk where that money went) but my wells fargo bank account is currently -$2700 and i dont plan to pay it back. I usually just ghost debt collectors and i could care less about my credit score rn, i just need to make some good trades to fix all of this.  Today i just rode the bus to my amazon job interview. On the way back there was a huge group of artistic kids on the bus. I cant help but think the man above was trying to tell me something, like I was one of them. The worst part is, those kids probably have more money than me right now... tomorrow im gonna donate plasma and take that money and yolo it right into 0dtes  **Edit: I just knew this post would get noticed lol. I think this just inspired me to become a writer. Maybe I will write a best seller on my artistic failures and adventures in life to save enough money to yolo into more options that I base on my technical analysis and research that clearly outlines how artistic I am.

Remember ford &amp; gm has a lot of debt when compared to tesla  The trend toward electrification is clear, Tesla's lead is unassailable and Tesla's business spans far wider than just cars  Now the most anticipated Tesla‚Äôs product ‚Äòcybertruck‚Äò will start production in last q3 2023 &amp; high volume production by next year q1 2024, cybertruck sales can further boost the tesla margins &amp; will further increase the cash pile of tesla  Summary   Tesla is far superior to Ford &amp; gm in most areas, especially in margins, profitability, and cash flow. As of last quarter march 2023, Ford has a total long-term debt of $140 billion, while GM is right behind with $115 billion in the same category, Tesla, on the other hand, has just $5 billion in long-term debt, and plenty of cash to show for.

From Norway's national wealth managers to all the Wall Street analysts, and even AI bros, they're all telling us based on their research that the FED will maintain high rates. They are positioning their money accordingly... so, unless you have some insider information, I would rather believe the charismatic Nicolai Tangen (CEO of the Norway fund) over you degenerates.   What does this mean for Tesla? EVERYTHING. Their sales are going to crumble. People don‚Äôt feel comfortable buying a car when the interest rates are so high. And despite all the contradicting claims, at the end of the day, Tesla sells C A R S! Speaking of that...  **FSD/Robotaxi/Solar City/Hyperloop...Etc.** This one is a doozy, all in all. I think Elon Musk is a con artist. He promises the world, hypes up his stock, then offloads it on us, presumably using the funds to "actually do the work."

[Is Berkshire Hathaway's Hidden Mystery Stock Purchase Tesla? ($BRK.A, $TSLA),;,; &amp;#x200B;  https://i.redd.it/7m7dix6tdric1.gif  Berkshire Hathaway's recent request for confidential treatment from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the purchase of undisclosed stock(s) has sparked speculation. This move, aimed at concealing specific investments from public knowledge, suggests a strategic play by CEO Warren Buffett to continue acquiring shares without influencing the stock price. Such tactics allow Berkshire to amass significant positions at lower costs, given that any disclosed investment by Berkshire often leads to a surge in the stock's price as investors rush to emulate Buffett's moves. This scenario unfolds as Berkshire Hathaway navigates the complexities of the current financial landscape, leveraging its considerable influence and capital to optimize its investment strategy.  I have a theory that the secret accumulation of Tesla shares by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, if true, could represent a significant shift in Buffett's investment strategy, recognizing the tech and automotive sectors' transformative potential. This move could symbolize a meeting of minds between Buffett and Elon Musk, particularly with Musk's engagement in the Giving Pledge, initiated by Buffett. The potential synergy could redefine investment philosophies toward tech enterprises and forecast the impact of autonomous driving on the insurance industry, notably affecting Berkshire's Geico. This theory suggests a future where Musk's tech innovation and Buffett's investment savvy might reshape the automotive and insurance landscapes, especially in auto insurance risk management in the autonomous vehicle era.  I wouldn't put it past Buffett's team to be running a secretly coordinated campaign to negatively impact Tesla's narrative and share price. The coordinated stories of recalls that are merely software updates could be one example of this strategy. This approach would not only serve to depress Tesla's stock price, allowing Berkshire Hathaway to accumulate a more significant share at a lower cost but also exemplify the lengths to which Buffett's team might go to secure a strategic advantage in the market. This calculated move would underscore the depth of strategy employed by Berkshire Hathaway, manipulating market perceptions to favor their investment goals.,;,; 2024-02-15 14:24:00]

[Desktop Metal: A Ten-Bagger Tesla Story,;,; **Introduction**  Hey guys, I'm a long time member occasional contributor. Three years ago I [posted](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cpeu8i/petition_to_give_ubetterthanmadoff_a_very_special/) after a special autist posted some incredible DD after the market closed on a Friday about an impending market crash in Argentina. Last August, I [posted](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wlqb4q/desktop_metal_dd_long_term_tenbagger_and/) my first Desktop Metal DD thread on r/wallstreetbets. It's been a pretty tough year for the stock market and unprofitable tech companies like DM have been hammered hard. However, things are beginning to look much better for DM. Before I get into my DD, here's some background on the company:  **Background**  Desktop Metal went public via SPAC in 2021. They produce a revolutionary line of incredibly fast 3D printers that can compete with traditional casting on a price per part basis. They hold over 650 patents and can print in over 250 different materials. Their flagship product is the [Production System](https://www.desktopmetal.com/products/production) which began to ship. Designed for mass production of end use metal parts, it is over 100x faster than traditional 3D printing technologies putting it leaps ahead of its competition. Their product offering also includes the [Shop System](https://www.desktopmetal.com/products/shop) for mid-volume production, the [Studio System](https://www.desktopmetal.com/products/studio) for prototyping, Fiber for the 3D printing of a variety of carbon fibers, their new unit [Desktop Health](https://www.desktophealth.com/) for a variety of uses including dental, bone regeneration, soft tissue fabrication, and organ 3D printing. Recently, Desktop Metal released the Einstein Pro XL, an affordable production-grade 3D printer for dental labs and other medical professionals. You can read the press release [here](https://ir.desktopmetal.com/news/press-releases/detail/139/desktop-health-announces-global-availability-of-einstein). Recently revenue growth has been largely driven by the expansion of their healthcare unit. Photopolymers are a great addition to DM's portfolio and represent a $200B market opportunity.   In the last two years, they've made several important acquisitions with the $500mm they recieved as a result of going public via SPAC. In August 2021, they acquired their largest competitor, ExOne for $561mm in a mixed stock/cash deal. Desktop Metal has been incredible aggressive, spending over $800mm to buy out their competitors and adding new materials to their portfolio. They have 950+ issued patents and pending applications for their machines and materials. Their Studio System sells for roughly $300k and generates $1.1mm in lifetime revenue with 600k being profit. This is driven by the high profit margins on their materials. I believe that their materials portfolio represents the key to Desktop Metals long term growth and profitability.  As a result of these acquisitions, Desktop Metal grew rapidly. There were many redundancies that were eating into EBITDA and driving continued losses. Last year, Desktop Metal announced a $50mm cost cutting initiative as well as the hiring of a new CFO, Jason Cole, formerly of Analog Devices. On February 6th, [Desktop Metal announced another $50mm in cost cutting measures](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/desktop-metal-boosts-productivity-by-updating-cost-cutting-plans-for-2023-220642/#:~:text=Industrial%203D%20printer%20manufacturer%20Desktop,its%20long%2Dterm%20financial%20objectives.) for a total of $100mm in annual cost reductions. Jason has demonstrated a strong desire to achieve profitability as soon as possible over growth at all costs.  As companies look to shorten and de-risk their supply chains, Desktop Metal provides a compelling product to reduce material waste and cut costs. Their printers are already used by companies like BMW, Lockheed Martin, Stanley Black and Decker, and many more. Their products have additional aerospace, automotive, consumer goods, medical, and military applications. Revenue has grown significantly from $26mm in FY 2019 to $206mm in FY 2022. FY 2023 revenue is projected between $210-260mm due to macro headwinds with breakeven EBITDA being achieved in Q3 or Q4.  **Why DM is Attractive**  Desktop Metals Q4 earnings were fantastic and exactly what investors needed to see. The result of their $100mm cost cutting initiatives are beginning to show through on their income statement. Operating expenses [fell to $37.9mm in Q4 2022, down $3.6mm from Q3](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_78b61139c42c8f258a21fe79e9c13a8a/desktopmetal/db/884/7565/earnings_presentation/DM+4Q-22+Earnings+Presentation+vF.pdf). During the Q&amp;A portion of the call, an analyst asked about what revenue would be required for DM to breakeven next year. The CFO, Jason Cole, stated that DM would breakeven across the whole forcasted revenue range of $210-260mm. This is **huge**. Desktop Metal has been priced for the last year as if it was on the verge of bankrupcy. Until today's 30%+ surge, Desktop Metal was valued less than the market value of their competitor ExOne which they acquired last year for $560mm. The market has been confused with how to value Desktop Metal and this is why I think we have such an incredible opportunity in front of us today. Craig-Hallum analyst Greg Palm [released in a note](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3673587&amp;headline=dm-craighallum-warming-to-desktop-metal-after-new-supply-agreement-1677774515&amp;test2&amp;ref=tipranks) said that he is "warming up to Desktop Metal" following "solid Q4 results" and that "momentum seems to be building in several areas of the business." While he kept his $2 price target and a hold rating, he said this was "to wait for additional evidence of business trends improvement" but that "he believe the stock can work higher from current levels."  While I was also bullish six months ago in August, my thesis was that the risk/reward profile of bankrupcy to non-bankrupcy was favorable. Yesterday, we got confirmation that Desktop Metal would **NOT** go bankrupt and achieve profitability in FY 2024 -- a full year ahead of schedule. They have $750mm in assets ($360mm in current assets) and $260mm in liabilities per their 10-K released yesterday. This guarantees that they have enough of a runway to reach 2024 where they will achieve full year profitability. Desktop Metal also teased on the earnings call that they will soon be announcing a Master Supply Agreement signed with a major consumer electronics company that per Twitter, is rumored to be Apple. If true, it would mark a major milestone for DM. Despite this, short interest was 21% before yesterdays earnings per [Koyfin](https://app.koyfin.com/snapshot/s/eq-0digtg) -- even higher than it was when I posted in August. You can read their full Q4 2022 earnings report [here](https://ir.desktopmetal.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001558370-23-002567/0001558370-23-002567.pdf) and their press release [here](https://ir.desktopmetal.com/news/press-releases/detail/141/desktop-metal-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022).    **This Is A Tesla Story**  In late 2019 and early 2020, Tesla demonstrated something very similar to what DM showed in their earnings yesterday -- that they would not be going bankrupt and that they had a viable road to profitability. Just like with DM, people knew that the technology was going to change entire industries and investors didn't want to get left behind even if they had to pay a premium for a piece of the pie. Tesla shares exploded, rising from around $20 per share to a peak of $400 per share last year. I believe that yesterday was a monumental moment for Desktop Metal, and the market seems to agree. As of 3:30PM, shares are up 38% trading around $2.08.   If DM were to generate $0.50 in EPS and trade at **moderate** 20x current P/E, shares would trade at $10 per share for a 400% return from current levels. With &gt;20% EPS growth, DM could achieve EPS of &gt;$1.00 per share by 2030 for a **conservative** share price of $20 for a 900% return. EPS growth of &gt;40% is possible for DM even in a challenging macro environment. Considering that DM's profit largely comes from their consumables, they will become increasingly profitable with time as their machines sell and customers continue buying DM's expansive material inventory. Other fast growth tech companies like Cloudflare trade at P/E's in the **hundreds** due to their high projected revenue and EPS growth. If DM traded at even half of Tesla's old forward EPS in 2025, we could see a share price in the hundreds.    **My Positions**  2000 shares at $2.40  2 $2.50 Jan 2025 call  3 $3.00 Jan 2025 calls  4 $4.00 Jan 2025 calls   6 $5.00 Jan 2025 calls   **Conclusion**  When Desktop Metal begins to get more press, people are going to pile into the company. It has all the ingredients for a meteoric rise. Transformative new technology, some media hype, and **28% of all shares are short.** Desktop Metal is a no-brainer for ~$2.00 in 2023. While I'm not going to give a price target, Desktop Metal has an insane amount of room to run.  3/3 Edit: Spelling and I had to delete the Imgur links due to sub policy,;,; 2023-03-02 20:53:51]

[Tesla and TSLA,;,; I have written about TSLA before. They are in a very strong position. The only thing holding TSLA back is that Elon has apparently gone insane.  Tesla is still the strongest EV maker by far. They are sold out for months and months depending on the model and market. Their energy division grows in the background, and nobody notices. Other EV makers talk big, but do not have the battery supply chains. They can't make enough EVs to matter.  (See Back Ground posts below. For some reason, Reddit won't let me post the links. )  What really matters is the PE ratio and growth. I have written about this before in the above posts. Right now, it is about 57. Which really isn't that high for a company that is doing such huge growth. They made 1.3 million vehicles in 2022. But they are already as of now, at a production rate of 1.7million vehicles. By the end of 2023, it will be even higher. A company doing a 35% to 40% YoY growth rate is not at all high to have a 57 PE ratio.  &amp;#x200B;  **Edit: Here is the TLDR,**  **6 million cars per year leads to a $2.1 Trillion Market Cap with a very reasonable PE ratio.**   **---6million cars per year x margin of $12K per car = 72Billion.**   **---72B x reasonable PE ratio of 30 = $ 2.1Trllion**  **This ignores supercharger fees, robotaxi nonsense, energy sector, solar, subscriptions, etc**  **(They already have very good margins on their cars. Reuters says $15K per car already)**  &amp;#x200B;  From a Post in 2021  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  &amp;#x200B;  Tesla Stock still has huge growth potential.  Listen up fellow apes. I will try to make this short and simple. I believe TSLA is headed towards a $2T Market Cap.  **PE Ratio**  The PE Ratio measures current share price relative to its per-share earnings. This reflects how much an investor is willing to pay for earnings.  For a company not rapidly expanding, a normal P/E ratio is around 20:1. The average PE for the S&amp;P is something like 15.  We have all read about TSLA having an insanely high PE ratio in the past. That was before they started making over $1B per quarter.  Now the PE ratio is lower, but still very high.  TSLA is currently around a PE of 112 for forward earnings. The stock costs \~$650 per share. And the earnings per share were $1.45 for Q2.  So 650/ (1.45 x 4 quarters) = A forward PE of about 110.  (I am multiplying by the most recent Q2 and assuming the earnings are the same going forward for the sake of simplicity in this example)  Another way is to take annual earnings and the total market cap of the company. Their recent earnings were about $1.14B in Q2. So assume $4.56Billion for the next year.  $622B market cap / 4.56B annual earnings = PE ratio of \~135  This is with them making around 200,000 vehicles per quarter in Q2 2020. Or an annualized rate of just over 800,00 vehicles per year. Just doing an average of 1.14Billion / 200,000 gives us about $5,000 "per car". This ignores the energy sectors and software, solar, etc. Just a point of reference for an average.  **Future**  Does anyone expect Tesla to be standing still for the next few years?  Of course not.  With Berlin and Texas coming online, Tesla may reach 900,000 cars this year. In 2022 they will likely be well over 1.5million cars per year. So let's assume that by 2024 they are making 3 million cars per year.  3,000,000 cars x $5,000 per car = $15Billion per year in earnings.  How about with $8,000 per car?  =$24Billion  $24Billion x 30 = $720Billion Market Cap  How about a PE ration of 50. Since this seems like something investors have had no trouble tolerating over the life of TSLA's stock.  $24B x 50 = $1.2T Market Cap.  Let's try that again for 2028  Assume 6million cars per year and profits of $12,000 per car as efficiencies ramp up across all sectors.  This gives an annual earnings of $72B.  ((-Again, this sort of ignores the energy sector, software potential, etc.  \-Just the $10/month that Tesla charges for premium connectivity will become a high margin revenue generator. Around 2023 or 2024 Tesla will have about 5million cars on the road being charged the monthly cost.  $120/year x 5,000,000 cars = $600,000,000 per year in mostly profit.  \-The Supercharger costs to other Automakers could also become a huge revenue generator. ))  **A PE ratio of 30 on $72B is $2.1T**  This would be a stock price around $2200 per share.  If Investors are willing to tolerate a higher PE, then the Market Cap could hit 2T much sooner.  **Other Notes**  It is worth considering that if the stock gets into the Low $1,000s, Tesla may split it again. When it was announced last time there was a massive increase in the stock price before the split. It went from the low 1,000s to the mid $2,000s. The Mid $2,000s would be a Market Carp \~ $2T.  Edit: No matter what you think about 'FSD', it should be easy for everyone to accept that once Tesla gets FSD approved in a single jurisdiction, the stock will also jump through the roof. It doesn't matter if it will be in 2022, 2023, or 20XX, etc. I left that out since it is a whole separate discussion. And is not needed for my math of a $2T market cap.  Don't listen to me. Ignore my assumptions. Invest in Banana futures.  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  Another Older Post  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  Greetings fellow simians and proto-simians,  I wrote a post a while back that got some interest about being long TSLA.  I won't rehash the $2T market cap position. This post will go over various points of Tesla's advantages or disadvantages in support of a $2T market cap and overall value as a company and stock. HODL until 2024, stock price or year.  This may come across as the rantings of a mad-man. But I will try to make it coherent.  Notes:  1. All this will be done without a realization of FSD. That will have a huge change on stock price as soon as it is approved in a single jurisdiction. 2. Also, Please note, that once TSLA gets into the low thousands, another Stock Split is likely. Last time a stock split was announced the price went from the low $1,000s to the low $2,000s by the time of the Split.  **Tesla Advantages**  A) Tesla has more battery supply contracts.No other company can come close to Tesla on quantity or KWHr/$ cost for battery packs.(VW has substantial contracts. But even then, it seems unlikely their vendors will be able to actually obtain enough raw material supply.)For Example, the moron Executives at Ford did not even realize that the EV Battery Supply for the world was already contracted out for Years.  B) Software/Over the Air........In 2021, not even VW can figure this out.  C) Software based UI  Less buttons, cables, supply chain.The cost is in the supply chain.People think the minimalist interior of the 3 and Y are driven by Elon's ego. But really, the less stuff = less costs. Less install, less holding and supply costs, less wires, etc etc.The lack of traditional air vents might look cool, but it is really about having less parts.  D) Supercharger Network.Tesla has the largest charging network in the World. This is a huge revenue generator and asset for Tesla Owners.  E) Tesla Sells more EVs in North America/US than all the other OEMs put together...... x 4.[https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020](https://www.futurecar.com/4102/Tesla-Vehicles-Made-Up-80-of-all-EV-Sales-in-the-First-Half-of-2020)  F) If you count road trip capable EVs, (can charge fast enough) Tesla sells over 90%.The crappy leafs and bolt type EVs cannot charge fast enough for a road trip.  G) People hate car dealerships more than the Dentist for a lot of reasons. People like buying things online and not having to interact with other humans. Besides just being able to order online, with a Tesla, you can see the actual price of the actual car. That is the price. It is nearly impossible to get an actual out-the-door price from a legacy dealer until the final paperwork for the car.As consumers become more and more aware of this, it will be a sales advantage for Tesla.  H) The potential EV market is huge.  Every Dinosaur OEM is always stunned when their EV offerings sell out in minutes. People want EVs. Tesla is not really competing against other EVs. They are taking sales of dinosaur ICE sales.  G) Tesla Engineers in different areas work together. In a normal OEM world, the radiator team does not work with the regen-break team. Tesla staff do work together. So there is less bulk and unneeded parts in Tesla products.  H) The "Model 2" is likely to be announced soon. This is the cheaper compact EV expected to be made and marketed in China.  I) All Teslas are capable of Road Trips.(Big Enough Battery, Efficient enough Mileage, Fast Enough Charge Rate miles per minutes charging). Not to mention robust enough charging network.  J). Right now, it is very difficult in the lower 48 to be more than 75 miles from a Tesla Supercharger. It is also very difficult to be on an expressway and be more than 50miles from a Supercharger. This is a huge asset and Tesla is already there now. Not in a few years.[https://supercharge.info/map](https://supercharge.info/map)  K) Seamless Supercharging.Have you ever used a non-Tesla fast charger? The process is awful. The stalls might be broken, they don't handshake with the car, the payment doesn't work etc. They are in shopping parking lots instead of along major travel routes.  **Disadvantages**  A) Non-FSD chip Supply(Shouldn't affect Tesla more than any other OEM. But may have more airtime in the media due to FUD spreaders)  B) FUD in the media. Example: Jalopnik has a huge audience. But they can't print an accurate story about Tesla if their lives depended on it. Reading the Jalopnik comments on a Tesla Story is like listening to conspiracy rants from the Capitol Rioters. Tesla gets them clicks. Printing something sensational gets clicks. Here is an example. Many outlets, including Jalopnik, recently reported that Tesla finally made a profit without Reg Credits (pollution emission credits). Except that Tesla has made a profit in the past without Reg Credits. It is hard to believe someone writing an article could be this bad at math and research. Taxes are paid on income from Reg Credits. So you have to subtract both the income AND the taxes on that income if you want to know Tesla's Quarterly balance sheet without Reg Credits. \*\* Math Below  **Other OEMs are mostly Morons**  A) Ford has paired with SK to make a factory that can make 125GWHrs per year.....in 2025.This is a decent amount of battery supply. But again, this is really only enough Batteries for &lt;2 million cars annually...by 2025. And this is if they can even get the supply contracts for raw materials. Tesla Will be making 2 Million electric cars per year by the middle of 2023 if not sooner.  B) Most other electric cars in North America are still compliance nonsense like the Bolts.  B1) The Bolts are really just there to sell Silverados. The Bolts can't fast charge enough for a road trip. The Bolts catch fire and have recalls that aren't reported much in the news. Could you imagine if Tesla told people to stop charging their vehicles indoors or unattended? There would be articles calling for Blood.  B2) The MachE is a good car spec wise. (It really is a compliance car for the EU though)But was clearly designed by a company that is Silo'd. Meaning the engineering groups do not work together. Sandy Munro - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1dQtlrI7uU)  B3) There are only a handful of non-Tesla electric cars in North America in models and total quantity that can actually charge fast enough for non-local driving. Most of these are pricey. It is Q3 2021. Selling an EV that can only charge at 150KW peak charge rate is a joke. Even the ID4 is more like 125KW.  C) GM appears to be MoronsThese people paired with Nikola. How dumb could a company be?Anyone who follows the EV space knew that Nikola was vaporware long before the latest fraud accusations.  [https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/)  D) Tesla is sold out for Months. (2022 forfor some)This is a great problem to have in most circumstances. If you want a Tesla in 2021, you should be ordering it now.  E) There are something like 1.2 million Cybertruck reservations.  Even if only half of those turn into actual orders, that is still $40 Billion in revenue.  Presumably more and more orders will come in once deliveries start being made and people see them in person.[https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html](https://www.fr24news.com/a/2021/08/tesla-cybertruck-orders-exceed-1-2-million-units.html)  For comparison, the F150 lighting has about 150,000 reservations/orders. Which is great. Except that Ford has no battery supply to deliver most of these for the next several years.  F. Toyota is still Gaslighting us about Hydrogen.  [https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/toyota-bet-wrong-on-evs-so-now-its-lobbying-to-slow-the-transition/)  G. People think a common parts bin is an asset. It mostly is not. If you are designing common EVs, then yes sure, a common parts bin makes sense. But what it really has done to most offerings from Dinosaur OEMs has forced decisions that were based on the part; not the design need. See Sandy Munro videos for examples. But the MachE is a good example.  **Ranting about Hydrogen Fuel Cells**  ZZ) Hydrogen is for snake oil for Gaslighting morons. Most people think that Hydrogen is burned in Fuel cells cars. HFCs actually work like this: You put a bunch of energy into making, storing, and transporting hydrogen, then later, you get a small small amount of that energy back. Each KG of Hydrogen created will produce about 9KG of C02. (before accounting for storage and transport)[https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/)  \*\* TSLA Q3 2020 Example  [https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/](https://cleantechnica.com/2020/10/25/tesla-bears-prove-easy-q3-math-is-hard/)  People who spread that myth are not recognizing that taxes are paid on reg credit income.Reg credits have taxes paid on them.  Less Income = Less Taxes.Income from Reg Credits is taxed.  555 income before taxes186 paid in taxes= about 34% tax rate  If people claim that they only made a profit from regulatory credits, then subtract out regulatory credits AND the taxes paid on them.555 - 397= \~158  158 \* tax rate of 34% or so = 53milli in taxes  158-53mil in taxes = over 100mil in profit.  The point being they have made a profit in previous quarters without reg credits. It is just that most journalists are too lazy to understand math.  As always, don't listen to me.

[2024: A Stormy Forecast for Tesla? Unveiling Potential Challenges and Stock Shadows...,;,; Hey fellow stonk enthusiasts, gather 'round for a hot take on the electric rollercoaster that is Tesla. Here's my breakdown of the imminent mayhem that's about to hit the fan:  1. **Twitter(x) Tightrope - Elon's Social Symphony:** Rumour has it that Twitter is wobbling on its financial tightrope, and Elon himself has admitted as much. In the first act of this financial symphony, Elon faces a dilemma: play the hero or watch the show from the wings.    1. Elon might decide to rescue the sinking Twitter ship. However, the real cliffhanger is how he plans to fund this rescue mission. Selling his TSLA holdings seems like a logical move, but the market might start doing its own rendition of a flash crash as investors rush to mimic his steps. A dance of financial calamity reminiscent of the 2022 disaster could unfold, but this time with Tesla in a more precarious position.    2. On the flip side, Elon letting Twitter go under could be equally disastrous. It's not just about the financial hit; it's about dispelling the myth of Elon as the 4D chess mastermind. The stock, heavily wrapped in the mystique of Musk's visionary maneuvers, could suffer a Shakespearean tragedy. Besides without his Twitter platform, Elon loses his megaphone to the masses, leaving him vulnerable to the orchestrated dissonance of mainstream media. he'll just be a billionaire shouting into the void ‚Äì a cosmic injustice. 2. **Growth in Slow-Mo:**  Tesla hits pause on growth projects, akin to a director halting a scene. The plot thickens as the company's once-soaring valuation now teeters on the edge, impacted by a macroeconomic rationale explained in the last earnings call. 3. **FSD/Robotaxi Slow Clap and Elon's "Soon" Chronicles:**  FSD has become the "I'll do it tomorrow" of the tech world. People aren't dumb; they're just patient... until they're not. When the FSD bubble bursts, it'll be a revelation as sweet as finding out the magician's tricks. And the robotaxi dream? Let's just say it's on a time-out, sipping a cold beverage somewhere in Elon's mind. 4. **Cybertruck Comedy Hour:**  The Cybertruck ‚Äì because nothing says "innovation" like a car designed with a protractor, faces production delays, regulatory headaches, and a price tag that makes you question Elon's math skills. It's the underdog of the electric vehicle race, and not the cool, Rudy-esque underdog ‚Äì more like the "why did I bet on this horse" underdog.  Eddit - forgot about Optimus   5. Optimus Distraction-Musk's Belated Robo-Show: In the Tesla circus, behold Optimus, Elon's latest shiny distraction. A new lure to captivate the public's attention a little while longer, reminiscent of the fading charm of Hyperloop, Solar City, and Mars City. Much like its predecessors, Optimus is poised to slowly fade away once its distracting capabilities are depleted.  Anyone entertaining the idea that Tesla can just pop out of nowhere and take over humanoid Robotics should be laughed out of the room, but just to entertain the idea, here are theain reasons this is ludicrous:  A.They are FAR too late, they will need a minimum of 10 years to just catch up with the current leaders.  B.  Current battery tech spells trouble for a humanoid robot, offering a mere 10 minutes before it's tethered to a socket. What productivity can be achieved in such a short span? C. Entertaining the idea that the success of Full Self-Driving (which is highly doubtful anyway) in cars seamlessly transfers to humanoid robots is a fantasy. FSD operates in a simplified 2D environment, following predetermined paths on a map. This is vastly different from the complex 3D interactions and tool handling required for humanoid robots. Even if they manage to get FSD for cars, it will be absolutely useless for robots. Thus, Tesla has no inherent advantage over established players in this field. They will likely end up just another robotics company, assuming they follow through, which, I guarantee you, they will not. In about two years, this venture is likely to be nothing more than a distant memory.   &amp;#x200B;  TLDR:  Twitter tap-dancing turmoil, Elon's financial ballet might trigger a TSLA nosedive. Growth hits pause due to macroeconomic whispers, while FSD's "soon" saga and Cybertruck hurdles add to the stock's cliffhangers. Not to mention supply chain chaos, EV rivals, and regulatory risks join the cast, painting a backdrop of uncertainty.,;,; 2023-12-30 21:12:16]

[Tesla's $TSLA humanoid Optimus robots have option value today,;,; How does one analyze a business segment that could have Trillions (with a T) of dollars in annual revenue in the year 2050? A discounted cash flow model is the way to go, but the problem is that small changes in the assumptions make huge differences in the outcome. However, in the case of Tesla's humanoid robot offering Optimus, the size of the price is so incredibly large that one can make extremely conservative assumptions and still end up with meaningful option value. I say extremely conservative, except for the main assumption...  Anyone following the hype around humanoids knows that someone predicted that there could be a a total of a billion humanoids in about 20 years, and then Elon Musk gave that notion a thumbs up. At first blush a billion humanoids seems absurd, but that's because one thinks of humanoids as humans, when in fact they're machines. Also, one might think of the claims made about autonomous vehicles, and shrug off a billion humanoids.   Again, it sounds crazy, right? But there will be 10s of millions of EVs being produced a year later this decade. If one thinks of a humanoid as no more complex than an EV, then one can see how it's likely that there will in fact be a billion humanoids *SOME DAY*. The question is, will it be by 2040, 2050, or 2060? I choose 2050, and I assume Tesla sells a total of 177M (an arbitrary # based on ramping up in my model to 6M units in 2033, then increasing sales by 5%/yr. through 2050).   In some ways that's a conservative assumption, because if Tesla gets to 6M units/yr., there's no reason to assume it will only grow 5%/yr. However, the BIG assumption is that 10s or even 100's of millions of humanoids will be ~~rolling~~ walking off assembly lines. The stumbling block is not the hardware, that will be perfected by Tesla and others this decade. The AI embedded in the robot is critical. Humanoids will be in the workforce this decade. In my model, by 12/31/29 there will be 637,572 humanoids working around the world.   There are billions of jobs that humanoids can eventually perform, so 637,572 humanoids is a drop in the bucket. Here's where more conservatism kicks in again, what price will Tesla sell Optimus bots for? I assume before long Elon Musk will be giving them away for free -- the razor/razor blade model. This tremendous opportunity for Tesla and others will center around leasing bots and charging for software/AI, the brains of Optimus. How much could Tesla lease worker drones for?   Well, humans cost \~$36/hr. (incl. benefits) in factories, warehouses &amp; assembly line work. If Tesla charged owners **$3/hr.,** per bot, the savings to manufacturers could be **\~$28/hr.** per job (factories have overhead and there would be consumables, lubricants, parts, electricity, batteries, etc.). So, at $3/hr./bot, Tesla's revenue would grow to over **$2.5 Trillion dollars** in 2050, *(from humanoids alone),* b/c it would be earning $3hr. on 177M ***cumulative*** Optimus bots in circulation by 2050. Okay, that $2.5 Trillion needs to be discounted back to today.   And, what about cap-ex to design, develop &amp; construct factories to build 177M humanoids buy 2050? I factor all that in by assuming an incredibly large total cap-ex hurdle of **$60B** from 2024-2034. Why is that figure likely to be very conservative? Tesla's Optimus units will share costs across Tesla's platforms. They could be built in or around existing &amp; planned giga-factories, the software/AI in Optimus will be the same as that used in Tesla's EVs.   To recap, Tesla will eventually be giving away humanoids, and charging $3/hr./bot to lease them, and the Optimus segment will cost a total of **$60B** through 2034. Discounting cash flows back at a 10% discount factor, the NPV(10%) is **\~$3.5T** or \~**$1,093/share**, vs. Tesla's current share price of **\~$190**. Let's say there's a 10% chance Tesla will sell 177M humanoids by 2050. Then, the option value of the opportunity is $1,093 x 10%  = **$109.3/shr**. And, if Tesla doesn't sell 17.7% of the first billion humanoids, perhaps it will sell 10% of 2 billion humanoids by 2060...   What if Tesla is not a leader in humanoids? That's possible, but it has so much cash to deploy vs. start-ups that it can and will buy other companies. Other large companies will come to own large shares of the market as well by rolling up robotics companies &amp; start-ups. There are about 8-10 global automakers that dominate 90% of sales. Tesla should be among the 8-10 that dominate 90% of the humanoid market. ,;,; 2024-02-15 05:30:56]

And it raises important and interesting questions.     I was reading that some suggesting there may be no stocks available if this rush continues for a longer period. If that turns out to be true, then is it conceivable that Tesla share price may likely go up to unrealistic levels? Of course, increasing the shares is easy to solve that challenge. But what happens to real value when stock price ends up in levels that misrepresent Tesla Inc., value by business shifts in favor of the many competitors in the market.     I can imagine a scenario where TOO many buyers/investors with the intention of holding the stock for long term... could push and cause the problem. I can think this situation in produce markets and the futures market. When Demand overwhelms Supply, inflation results. In important and necessary products this becomes a real problem. Can the Market balance the picture should that be the sole challenge. I find this interesting. Also a wait to buy when share price falls may may not be a good idea should share price keep going higher when this phenomenon becomes a real challenge.     Does anybody have an idea of similar and comparable situation. Obviously more securities are printed in the end. I heard recently a friend who worked in the insurance business say that it's easy and fast to sell insurance papers to raise easy money in the market, lol. And when the company faces a disaster when multiple participants are hit simultaneously, the company goes bankrupt. The larger risk is on the insured who may lose property... and life.

[The Impending Cybertruck Disappointment: High Cost, Low Range,;,; \[Edit: Let me preface this by saying that TSLA comprises almost 1/3 of my portfolio, I worked for an Elon company, and that I have a day one CT reservation\]  4680 battery cells. These were supposed to be Tesla's game changer, leading the EV charge with superior energy density and reduced cost. But teardowns show that they have an ever lower energy density than 2170s, and clearly have done nothing for range across the S3XY line.  Panasonic, Tesla's partner in this battery crime, can't even manage to mass produce 4680 cells, thanks to a comedy of production errors. The ramifications are serious and far-reaching:  [https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-doesnt-see-higher-volume-production-for-electric-semi-truck-until-late-2024-b49f639](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-doesnt-see-higher-volume-production-for-electric-semi-truck-until-late-2024-b49f639f)  Tesla is likely forced to renege on its promise of rolling out the range-topping, 3 plus motor model. Instead, they're limping into the race with a less battery-intensive initial model, while the 500-plus-mile model joins the 500-mile Model S in the realm of the indefinitely delayed.  Whispers are suggesting that this initial Cybertruck will only have a range of 350 miles. If you've been watching the field, you know that Chevy's electric Silverado (even the base model WT) laughs at that, boasting a range of 450 miles plus.  500 miles was the Cybertruck's main selling point. And without that, looks alone won't make it sell.  [https://twitter.com/beardedtesla/status/1680242871503409152?s=46&amp;t=iWGOCzVbudkbHSOyFNRoBw](https://twitter.com/beardedtesla/status/1680242871503409152?s=46&amp;t=iWGOCzVbudkbHSOyFNRoBw)  Now for the price. Elon has hinted at the truck being more expensive than anticipated, and boy, will it. Sources suggest that the base price of this initial model will be at $69,999.  Although these stats make it a strong competitor against the F-150 lightning, that's about it.  It's clear that Musk made some lofty promises about the Cybertruck's capabilities - impressive range, competitive price, even shatterproof windows - but the reality is looking grim. The stage is set for a serious disappointment. All these factors make a strong case for an underwhelming Cybertruck release, which could hit Tesla's stock hard.,;,; 2023-07-16 02:28:43]

[What to do for Tesla's Earnings Tonight,;,; Tesla (TSLA) is about to release Q1 2023 financial results today after the markets close. As usual, a conference call and Q&amp;A with Tesla‚Äôs management are scheduled after the results. These tend to move the stock big time, so the stakes are high for investors and degens like us. Options will definitely be fun to play with.  In this post, we‚Äôll take a look at what both the street and retail investors are expecting for the quarterly results.  **Tesla Q1 2023 deliveries**  As usual, Tesla already disclosed its Q1 vehicle delivery and production numbers, which drive the vast majority of the company‚Äôs revenue. Earlier this month, Tesla confirmed that [it delivered a new record of over 422,000 electric vehicles during the first quarter of the year.](https://electrek.co/2023/04/02/tesla-tsla-confirms-q1-2023-record-deliveries-beats-expectations/) Tesla also confirmed having produced 440,000 vehicles during the quarter ‚Äì also a new record. Delivery and production numbers are always slightly adjusted during earning results.  **Tesla Q1 2023 revenue**  For revenue, analysts generally have a pretty good idea of what to expect, thanks to the delivery numbers. The Wall Street consensus for this quarter is $23.617 billion, and [Estimize](https://www.estimize.com/sectors), the financial estimate crowdsourcing website, predicts a higher revenue of $24.048 billion.  Despite the new record number of deliveries, these estimates would represent a quarter-to-quarter decrease in revenue due to Tesla‚Äôs implementing large price cuts during the first quarter. Lower prices are probably a smart strategy considering higher interest rates, the potential for economic deceleration in 2023, more competition, and the new rules for tax credits under the [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/the-inflation-reduction-act-heres-whats-in-it). Nonetheless, it would be a massive year-over-year increase from $18 billion in revenue in Q1 2022.  Here are the predictions for Tesla‚Äôs revenue over the past two years, where Estimize predictions are in blue, Wall Street consensus is in gray, and actual results are in green: https://i.imgur.com/t7l4Nyj.jpg  **Tesla Q1 2023 earnings**  Tesla always attempts to be marginally profitable every quarter as it invests most of its money into growth, and it has been successful in doing so over the last two years now. For Q1 2023, the Wall Street consensus is a gain of $0.85 per share, while Estimize‚Äôs prediction is higher with a profit of $0.94 per share.  The estimates have a wide range this quarter because of the price cuts Tesla implemented during the quarter. Analysts and investors are looking to see how badly it is going to affect Tesla‚Äôs margins and, ultimately, its profits. Unsurprisingly, Tesla achieving the Wall Street consensus would be a big drop in earnings quarter-to-quarter, and the automaker would be flat on earnings year-over-year.  Here are the earnings per share over the last two years, where Estimize predictions are in blue, Wall Street consensus is in gray, and actual results are in green: https://i.imgur.com/rlj48di.png  **Other expectations for the TSLA shareholder‚Äôs letter and analyst call**  The obvious thing is the gross margin. Investors are going to be looking for that number first. They want to know by how much it dropped and how much room there is since Tesla continued to drop prices after the end of the quarter. If Tesla can stay in the mid to high teens, I think investors will be happy, but if it dips lower than that, they might have a problem. Investors will also be looking at insights from management about the pricing strategy, which seems to be changing fast.  Tesla shareholders will also be looking on an update on [Cybertruck production](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/25/23571806/tesla-cybertruck-volume-production-delay-2024-q4-2022) as the start of production gets closer, but knowing Tesla management, I wouldn‚Äôt expect much more than it being on track for a start of production this summer and volume production next year. Cybertruck should not have a material impact on Tesla‚Äôs revenue in 2023.  I assume that amid margins going down, Tesla investors are going to want to have an update on [Tesla‚Äôs self-driving program](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/autopilot), which has helped margins in the past, but the program has been stalling for a while now.  Shareholders will also be particularly interested in Tesla Energy this quarter and its potential future impact on Tesla‚Äôs financials. It has been a growing business for Tesla and with a [ramp-up in Megapack production](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/13/teslas-investor-day-ramping-up-the-megapack-business/), it should be bigger in Q1, but I wouldn‚Äôt expect a massive jump in deployment until the second half of the year. We will see what Tesla has to say about that.  **Trading Tesla Stock: Technical Analysis**  Trading Tesla stock is not for the faint-hearted. Shares have [produced sizable annualized volatility of 64%](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=2&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2023&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;leverageType=0&amp;leverageRatio=0.0&amp;debtAmount=0&amp;debtInterest=0.0&amp;maintenanceMargin=25.0&amp;leveragedBenchmark=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=TSLA&amp;allocation1_1=100&amp;symbol2=SPY&amp;allocation2_2=100) since inception. In plain English: as much as investing in the S&amp;P 500 is risky, investing in TSLA has historically been nearly five times riskier!  Of course, the possibility of even more intense price moves, either to the upside or downside, gets magnified around earnings day. To help figure things out, Wall Street Memes recently published a strategy for [trading Tesla stock](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/other-memes/tesla-stock-the-charts-send-a-clear-message).  To recap, TSLA has been struggling to break free of the 200-day moving average to the upside ([see here](https://i.imgur.com/S3SqpCf.png)). The good news is that selling pressure should ease each time that the stock gets denied further gains at the moving average, as the pool of sellers at that level shrinks.  If or when Tesla stock overcomes the hurdle, there is the possibility that a $300 price target set by the next key resistance level would open up a huge opportunity for bulls. Getting there from current levels implies a gain potential of over 60%. Such a move may sound like wishful thinking, but keep in mind that TSLA is all about high-risk and high reward. Earnings day is important because it could present the key catalyst that confirms the viability of the bullish trade ‚Äì or rejects it at once.  **So what to do for earnings?**  For all the reasons above, I think it would be reasonable to get a strangle on Tesla. For the noobies, a straddle is an options strategy where we buy both a call option and a put option on the same underlying stock with the same strike price and expiration date. This strategy is typically used if we believe the stock price will experience a significant price movement but is unsure of the direction. Grabbing the 4/21 190c and 170p doesn't seem like a bad idea. The stock will certainly move.,;,; 2023-04-19 17:05:28]

We have a really nice 4 day long blue bear channel that is very tight and very dramatic right now. One interesting thing to note is that the overall falling wedge that we were in support broke today. Which means we should be looking for a bigger down trend and a bigger bear channel instead of falling wedge. As you can see the potential red bear channel I have here support was even broke today so for now we are trying to establish where this is actually going to go.   The most important things to note from today is that this is the 4th red day in a row and not only that we attempted ot breakout back over the daily 50/200ema and rejected that. However, we did not quite break through the daily 100ema support at 396.6. As I mentioned before current movement would suggest 390 support retest is inbound.   Key SPY Support- 398.5 -&gt; 396.6 -&gt; 395.9 -&gt; 394.4   Key SPY Resistance- 401 -&gt; 403.1 -&gt; 405.3  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/n158e0rzitja1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98e51690f64d66f394474be4c4c0a4f94d4d0c23  Same story here on futures we have a very intense black bear channel for 5 days now‚Ä¶ and we are looking for futures to close right on the 4000 level right now.   Futures DID test 100ema here however bounced off of it but more importantly it rejected a breakout back over the daily 50/200ema. We also officially have a 8/ 20ema bearish crossover here too.

The biggest thing to note here is that black breakout/ down triangle was officially broke to the downside today. Tesla also attempted to break through and close back over its daily 8ema however was unable to do so.   Tesla did find a really nice support bounce off that 191.8 support area though.   Key Tesla Support- 197.4 -&gt; 191.8 -&gt; 183.5  Key Tesla Resistance- 200.8 -&gt; 205 -&gt; 209.2  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/e2gex6u1jtja1.png?width=609&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d24a72aece35d3dd67d2d51d2b4fe5885483edb  The VIX honestly is one of the most intriguing things of the day‚Ä¶ historically speaking the VIX generally has pretty significant sell offs post FOMC minutes as the ‚Äúfear‚Äù leaves the market and there is very little left to fear‚Ä¶ however, today we actually saw the VIX drop slightly and then recover and hold its own. I am interested by the fact that the VIX perfectly touched and rejected 23.6 resistance however did not break yesterdays LOD. The VIX appears for the time being that it has more room to go.   Tonight afterhours/ tomorrow pre market with nvidia, jobs and GDP is a really big day that I am very curious to see how markets will react/ open. Long term I still expect 390 before 405‚Ä¶ however, a relief bounce back to 400 would be warranted.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/dtuvy5a2jtja1.png?width=478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4f95c49e59bccd7620969a2ae8aad8457fde549  Actually taking a quick look here at Nvidia earnings their revenue beats might be one of the better earnings reports I have seen all earnings season. That is a fairly impressive report. Nvidia is now testing on the weekly time frame that 215.6 to 230.9 levels.. it has seen two massive rejections up in this level so it will be quite interesting to see what Nvidia does not only tomorrow but Friday.   **Daily log-**  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/hsmez0r2jtja1.png?width=811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ab27fa6a3e3916ef14380021bcbbee4c62abd5f  Overall had a pretty great trading day today.. had some 30-60dte puts that I did close today for some nice wins but also had a few l2l plays intraday.   Today was tough to trade because we ended up having such aggressive and wild moves price action wise and premium wise it was very difficult to get into some plays‚Ä¶ I probably missed at least 6 plays today that woulda been easy 5-10% wins simply because premiums moved so fast I never got filled and by that time it was chasing. No complaints from today for a fed day with elevated IV.   I remain bearish till we either break back through 405 OR we reach 390‚Ä¶ we are currently closed to 390 but I don‚Äôt suspect we will reach either by Friday EOD.,;,; 2023-02-22 22:43:22]

[The bulls and bears continue to fight‚Ä¶ 2-23-23 SPY/ ES Futures, and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,;,; Well that was probably one of the most impressive V bottom recoveries we have seen on SPY in many months. A straight drill of $6 followed by a $5 rally. Absolutely an impressive but frustrating day to trade.   That morning sell off has absolutely no chill at all‚Ä¶ we straight dumped without even the thought or whisper of a pullback. That was one of the most aggressive downtrends we have seen in a while. What is even crazier is that we managed to recover it all‚Ä¶  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/4mokemxia0ka1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7ebee6e2a441a5b00de61f0c76301b1d39a69c8  Tomorrow morning we get a doozy of data‚Ä¶ consumer spending/ persona income is going to be very interesting to see and not only that we get PCE and Core PCE‚Ä¶ with the preliminary PCE numbers along with PPI/ CPI we should be expecting some pretty hot numbers to come in. I will be very interesting to see how the markets digest these numbers.   The markets this morning despite lower jobs data and preliminary PCE hot reacted bearishly and then recovered it all‚Ä¶ however, most of that might have been related to the nvidia pump.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/qjs47dbja0ka1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=576949f72831ce8e1e9b87a10d4a963bf6f8e88b  The biggest thing to note on the daily here is the fight around the daily 200ema which sits currently at 399.93. Now if you take a look at the candle body resistance from January 23rd and candle body support from January 30th you can see that this 400.6 level that we closed on today is a big pivot level. Back in January when we had our breakout over 390 and 400 this is where we rejected for 3 days in a row, and then back tested support of before we broke out.   Bulls continuing to defend this level could show some overall strength.   However we have now closed 3 full candles below the daily 8ema which has not happened since middle of December when we were in the 380s. There is a very clear uptrend break, however, the question still remains of 390 or 405 retest first?   My thoughts are that IF we get a good PCE beat tomorrow (as in lower than expected) then we COULD see a push back to retest daily 8ema/ 405.3 resistance. If we close below that level that would could be seen as a retest/ rejection and bearish for next week. However, a recovery back over 405.3 would be extremely bullish.   IF we get HOT PCE and markets digest that negatively we could be looking at a bigger sell off that sticks. A closure under the daily 200ema and potentially off that 100ema near 396.6 that we bounced off today would be very bearish going forward. Now that we put in a green day here the chances of further sell off is greater.   Key SPY Support- 400.6 -&gt; 398.5 -&gt; 396.6  Key SPY Resistance- 401.5 -&gt; 403.2 -&gt; 405.3  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/07cbp6rja0ka1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=684f039ad81a3ef3267b2c8b2c0460cbfe7b59ba  Taking a look at futures daily here we actually have not taken back the daily 200ema and remain currently under neath that which sits at 4018.   The biggest thing to note here is that futures lost that key 4030 pivot level on Tuesday and now have failed 2 days in a row to break through and hold over that level. As long as bears hold us under 4030 the downside is greater than the upside in my opinion.   The biggest support area is that 3985 which is the daily 100ema though.   Key Futures support- 4010 -&gt; 3998 -&gt; 3985 -&gt; 3965  Key Futures resistance- 4030 -&gt; 4055 -&gt; 4085  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/mhk8ijdka0ka1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a2b0985e1f4d96a89d225ac876e4fab8017462c  Tesla continues to show impressive strength holding support off 197.1 for the 4th day in a row now‚Ä¶ As long as 197.1 support continues to hold we shouldn‚Äôt expect a bigger sell off‚Ä¶ yet‚Ä¶ The last 5 days now have been pretty much a fight over the daily 8ema back and forth. IT is clear that the upside momentum has slowed, however, it is not quite clear just yet that the overall downside move is coming.   Tesla is holding a nice 197.1 to 204.8 range and those should be the levels we watch closest for a breakout or breakdown.   Key Tesla Support- 202.1 -&gt; 197.3 -&gt; 191.8  Key Tesla Resistance- 205 -&gt; 209.2 -&gt; 214.3  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/t7rovwmma0ka1.png?width=618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7816d8a0b5b15e8162df34851ac70f7f9bd1e84f  The VIX finally came down and have a nice gap fill today. IT did maintain daily 8ema support also. The VIX doesn‚Äôt give us a whole lot of direction here at all. However, holding daily 8ema support should be bullish (as in markets will continue down). However if we break back under 21 tomorrow that push back to 405.3 resistance becomes even more probable.   **Daily log-**   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/vyjof9ela0ka1.png?width=805&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3882ad457f74a5cbdf11127dd927634466b366b  Not too bad of a day trading today. I got burnt in that 4dte call this morning on a fake breakout pretty much moments before that massive $6 dump started. And honestly based on everything I saw at that moment and my rules I would take that play again. It was a good play just didn‚Äôt work out.   Only other lost today came from getting burnt on this reversal. Historically speaking despite what SPY and 2022 wants us to believe‚Ä¶ to full on reverse spy like it did today is actually not common and shouldn‚Äôt be expected‚Ä¶ Take a look at Tuesday for example we had 3 or 4 moves throughout the day that looked extremely convincing of a big ole reversal upside that was just a put opportunity. I expected the same today and that 1pm double top rejection that then turned into a massive rip to the upside burnt me in puts. I had a few times I could have exited green but again I really did expect a push back to LOD and probability suggested the same.   I was happy that I was able to close all of my 30dte (besides AMD/ Nvidia) at the LOD on SPY which was also the LOD on them. The only ticker I would have held longer or wanted to hold longer would have been Google.   Overall looking at SPY weekly and tech as a whole weeklies (outside of nvidia) there is still a convincing case for downside to continues into the next CPI/ FOMC. However, we also have to take into account that we very well might just end up back in another $10 range from 390 to 400 or 395 to 405.,;,; 2023-02-23 21:28:29]
[Choppy Chop Chop‚Ä¶ 2-28-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis,;,; Well what was looking to be a pretty boring and untradeable day got to be a little exciting there EOD. I actually was very surprised to see bulls push it up like they did middle of the day as most technical did not really support a move like that. However, as seen below a perfectly timed tweet seems to have coordinated perfectly with that massive $3.13 sell off. It is not common that we go coast to coast (HOD to LOD) but we sure did today‚Ä¶   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ydk9nlxs10la1.png?width=603&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=59b04c062862c9df452fbe6f7741890fe12d2e64  Actually the most impressive thing is the fact that the final one minute candle dropped a total of $1.2.   To me it seemed like markets were starting to forget about the whole 50bps hike thing and CPI being HOT‚Ä¶ However, they were kindly reminded today and that seems to have fueled this sell off here today.   With markets reminded of 50bps we could see a small continuation sell off tomorrow.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/yhawulat10la1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=43b8b08cf0ec069e968cc14927fc79675f85861b  Taking a look at SPY here you can see we have a really nice black bear channel going here. There is also a tighter more aggressive bear channel (red) inside of that. That could very well be a falling wedge. If that is a falling wedge then resistance for bulls to break for an upside push would be 397.4 tomorrow. That level coincidentally enough was MAJOR support almost all day long.   The biggest things to note here is that tomorrow when markets open the daily 8ema will cross below the daily 50/200ema for the first time in over a month. Not only that but today we attempted ot break over the daily 200ema and couldn‚Äôt even touch it. Despite bouncing off the 100ema most of the day and yesterday we also closed below that.   I still am eyeing 390 here and hold to that until SPY closes back over 400. We also have an established supply level at 396.42 that we did break back and close under today. This level could turn itself into nice resistance here. We have a large gap on supply back down to 383.81 and upside to 414/415.23. After establishing demand at 400.6 on 2/23 we retested that yesterday and rejected there. We should with that rejection seek on next demand at 388.66 unless we can establish a new demand this week first.   Supply- 396.42 -&gt; 383.81  Demand- 400.62 -&gt; 388.66  Key SPY Support- 396.3 -&gt; 395.4 -&gt; 393.6 -&gt; 391.44  Key SPY Resistance- 397.3 -&gt; 398.5 -&gt; 400 -&gt; 400.6  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/0ohf9z2u10la1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e90448d650681c9cb9b19fa5f2471a0296e2b90  Taking a look at ES futures here we actually have an even more bearish looking chart than Spy. I said I was worried that we COULD see a double bottom off that 3975 and that could push us up and that was in the back of my mind. However, bears struck back with another daily 8ema rejection, crossing the daily 8ema below the 50/200ema and closing under the daily 100ema. Now only that but we have a bearish engulfing daily candle here.   Demand was established at 3975 on Friday which could have provided a bigger push up. However, we were not able to the the momentum up and with extreme bear momentum down the 8ema rejected us nicely here. With a presumable close below 3975 here the next target is 3915 demand.   However, Supply wise we had a previous level at 4020 and yesterdays candle resistance now becomes new demand at 3988. With a rejection off supply and also losing demand here I am very much so bearish on futures and I am looking for that 3915/3920 area to be touched. I remain bearish as long as futures is under 4020.   Supply- 3988 -&gt; 4020   Demand- 3975 -&gt; 3915   Key Futures Support- 3965 -&gt; 3945 -&gt; 3920  Key Futures Resistance- 3975 -&gt; 3990 -&gt; 4000 -&gt; 4008 -&gt; 4020  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/spzy5dpu10la1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efb38748f29da0da80d41f2f9439fd91f71b3e8f  Tesla had a surprisingly weak showing today. I would have expected more strength today leading into investor day. However, after establishing a supply zone at 207.7 yesterday it attempted to push back to the previous supply of 214.24 and was unable to. With that failure we should start looking for a push down to demand near 196.3. However, with the tsla event tomorrow after hours this could go either way.   Supply- 207.7 -&gt; 214.24 -&gt; 224.75  Demand- 196.29 -&gt; 164.18  Key Tesla Support- 205.6 -&gt; 202.1 -&gt; 197.8  Key Tesla Resistance- 210.7 -&gt; 214.2 -&gt; 219.2  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/00jhhvov10la1.png?width=625&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=420d3971ad03b09d8f51fd0dd18396d9f469023e  Kinda surprisingly here is the fact that the VIX did not spike when we had that massive EOD sell off. It id recoil a little bit eod and bounced off its daily 20ema and closed under its daily 8ema‚Ä¶ but with a sell off of that size I would have expected more bounce there. That could come tomorrow though. One thing I did note that besides Friday the PC ratio is very low this week on Spy.   **Daily log-**  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/0szs147w10la1.png?width=847&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=adf3d9be6d794183d582cb228d61fb46f6ae8225  Today was another really great day trading.

[Long on TSLA equity, waiting for another dip,;,; Thinking of holding a long position on Tesla if the price drops to 150. It's a bit of a gamble, but their new model being released in 2025 will have better profit margins than the sway of declining margins in the EV industry and Musk potentially gaining 25% of voting rights whilst semi autocratic could help them catch up in AI or specifically robotics which seems to be slightly neglected in the AI race and VC funding. The bet on Tesla to be a robotics leader is the biggest gamble however they need to do something to justify their tech valuation because at the moment their primary source of profit stems from automobiles and as opposed to previous predictions they will not have a monopoly over this industry when the EV revolution is realized. If the price drops to 150 (kind of unlikely) I'll probably take a position based on the premise that the valuation is more justified and that there is potential for exponential growth in robotics,;,; 2024-01-26 17:22:48]

[‚Ä¶Is everyone really maxing out all their retirement accounts before allocating to their taxable brokerage?,;,; Hello everyone, Imma be honest, i dont know a lot about investing/finance so idek if the question makes sense to most.  But basically, i see it encouraged everywhere to always max out tax advantaged accounts (if applicable) first before contributing to a taxable brokerage, is everyone really doing that?  I get that the salaries of ppl here are probably way bigger than mine, but i ask this question because I see individual stocks like aapl, nvda, tsla, etc. and i think ‚Äòoh it would be interesting/fun to invest in stuff like that‚Äô but ..i know I should like max out my 401k first yknow.

[How to move on from losses?,;,; Not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I‚Äôm gonna take a shot so mods delete if necessary. But long story short my investment portfolio has a handful of ‚Äúgrowth stocks‚Äù that are down significantly since I bought hem (late 2020/early 2021). When I first started investing I read a few books about value investing and to some degree got lucky because my first investments were $FB (meta now) and $TSLA. This unfortunately got to my head and made me cocky and in 2020 I invested in mostly in speculative, growth stocks that I thought would mimic growth similar to $TSLA. 3 years later I am sitting with massive unrealized losses. Hell, 2 of the companies ($PTRA &amp; $TTCF) I invested in went bankrupt already but those were relativity small positions. However I have some stocks, $SQ, $DASH, $BYND that I‚Äôm seeing 5 figure unrealized losses. I have deep regrets every time I log into my account and see those losses. I could of just put it in a mutual fund and probably been net positive. It‚Äôs gonna take years to recover from this.,;,; 2023-08-20 13:36:11]

[What Am I Missing in my Analysis?,;,; Edit: People seem to have a TSLA fixation and think I want to buy it. That's not the case. I don't care what your opinion of TSLA is. I've done my analysis of all the stocks mentioned below according to the analysis mentioned below. Tell me where my analysis falls short and what other methods I should consider (that don't involve technical analysis).   Seeing some recent rave reviews about TSLA, ADBE, and FDX lately. Talking about the charging method Tesla uses becoming the standard in North America and being adopted by SAE, Adobe's investments in generative AI, and Fedex being able to pick up some slack if UPS workers go on strike, as well as some other investments and innovations they've been making.  But the problem is, I just don't see them valued at good prices.   FDX is trading at almost 2.5x book and 21x earnings  ADBE is trading at 15x book, almost 47x earnings, and 12x revenue per share  TSLA is trading at almost 17x book, almost 74x earnings, and over 9x revenue per share.  From a valuation standpoint (P/B, P/E, and P/S), those numbers are completely unjustifiable when considering buying.  So is there something I'm missing? Something I'm failing to consider? It seems like in the case of TSLA and ADBE their tech advancements could be a competitive advantage. Or are these types of stocks just wildly overhyped and overpriced? Because from a valuation perspective (P/B, P/E, and P/S) things like DINO, PBR, TSN, NTR, X, HMC, WFG, BIO, and BNTX look like great buys - why wouldn't I just buy those. They seem much more fairly priced, even cheap...  So what am I missing? What else do I need to consider in my analysis, if anything?,;,; 2023-06-29 03:56:18]

[AMD and its (impressive?) P/E ratio,;,; I have a watchlist of 8 tech stocks and I was comparing the P/E ratios.  I see AMDs is largely out of place @ 1,084.39.  The other 7 (APPL, NVDA, GOOG, NVDA, TSLA, META, MSFT) and on average their P/E ratio is 48 (26:78).  So what gives?  Online I am reading that P/E is a gauge of investor sentiment on future growth in earning potential and is calculated based on prior 12 months of earnings.  AMDs P/E seems remarkable by comparison.  Does this not indicate that AMD is overbought?  edit: I was considering AMD for investment, given recent company news and its momentum has largely been positive over the long-term.  This number stands out to me, and it isn't a positive indicator in my mind.  Looking to reconcile my opinion after hearing some of yours - thanks!,;,; 2023-12-08 12:30:33]

[My strategy has been "wrong" for the last decade (Intl vs US). Will I continue to be wrong in the next decade?,;,; I made a decision 10+ years ago to invest heavily in international. IXUS is my largest holding. My logic at the time was that since I live and work in the U.S., international investing would be a bit of a hedge. International was also much cheaper on about every metric CAPE, PE, P/B etc. as it remains today.  Of course I've only gotten punished for my decision since then with the U.S. continuing to outperform. But when I bat around the idea of making changes now I find it hard to swallow that the U.S. will continue to outperform again for another 10 years. Am I crazy to stick with a portfolio heavily weighted towards intl?  I've got Fidelity ETFs but I'm sure the numbers are close for Vanguard:  IXUS: P/E of 13, yield of 2.3%, P/B of 1.7  ITOT: P/E of 21, yield of 1.4%, P/B of 3.7  Like what is more likely, the rest of the world seeing 50% multiple expansion to get to a P/E of 19.5 or the U.S. seeing the same to get to a PE of 31.5 or choose your own favorite scenario/metric. Maybe the numbers would get a little closer if you were to strip out the high flyers like AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, etc. I have been building out a position in SCHD to help get a little more balance but am I nuts to stay the course?   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;   ,;,; 2023-08-16 20:30:06]

[Talk me out of buying DIS,;,; Most of us if we had a time machine we would go back in time and buy AAPL, TSLA, NVDA. Well, I look at DIS ant notice it is trading at the same level as it was in 2014. So without the time machine, there is a chance to travel back 9 years and buy a blue chip stock?  I don't want to get into the politics of it. Quite candidly I'm conservative and support the FL laws. To me that is unrelated to the value here long term.  Reality is I just don't see DIS as a brand that is at any risk of liquidation or collapse; quite the opposite I see they could be primed for growth. They have their hands in several facets of the economy. Media, entertainment. They own some of the most iconic brands, if you want around the world and asked people to draw a picture of what they think of when they think of America, I bet either the mouse ears or McDonalds logo would be at the top.  Looking at the 2014 price, if the company has grown at just 6% a year that would put their stock price at $138 presently, so over 50% higher than the present value.  I think the end of the writers strike will help their stock, and I think a change in leadership will help their stock and I know Iger just came back on the scene and signed a new contract but at his age I could see the board making a change since their stock has continued to plunge upon his return.

Is there any real benefit of using an index fund?  The only thing I can think of is I would probably be unable to use a Stock and Shares ISA (equivalent to a Roth IRA, I think) as my index fund uses GBP even though the fund tracks US stocks. To my understanding as soon as I make investments in USD I can no longer use the ISA. From the UK for context.  EDIT: Thank you all for your input.

Feel free to correct any info here or add on more. Just looking to start a discussion on the different hot topics lately and the following stock picks that go along with them! I know there are several other big opportunities like weed,crypto,etc just didn‚Äôt wanna go overboard  **Lithium ( MALRY, LAC)**The booming EV market, along awith the growing demand for renewable energy storage, positions lithium as a key investment opportunity. Major automaker's substantial investments in EVs drive the need for lithium-ion batteries, while the increasing focus on sustainable energy ensures a sustained demand for lithium. Despite global lithium deposits, the challenge of securing a stable and cost-effective supply persists, presenting investment potential in companies involved in lithium exploration, mining, and battery production.  **GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, INTL )**Demand for GPUs comes from AI and machine learning for handling big data in areas like healthcare and finance. Data centers need GPUs for cloud computing as businesses shift operations online. In the gaming industry, GPUs are crucial for high-quality graphics in video games. Cryptocurrency mining, particularly for coins like Ethereum, relies on GPUs for their processing power. Overall, the demand is driven by the growing need for high-performance GPUs in AI, data centers, gaming, and cryptocurrency mining.  **Uranium (BHP, NXE )**The demand for uranium primarily stems from its crucial role in fueling nuclear power generation. As global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources intensify, the demand for nuclear energy has been on the rise, particularly in emerging economies like China and India. This growing demand, coupled with supply constraints and geopolitical factors affecting uranium production, creates a decent investment opportunity. As countries strive to meet their energy needs while minimizing carbon emissions, uranium stands out as a key component in the clean energy landscape.  &amp;#x200B;  Are you betting on any of these? If not what are you looking at?,;,; 2024-01-17 22:10:50]
[Trying to figure out how to properly manage my finances,;,; I [M28] have had a long journey investing and trading, and have lost a lot of money, and I‚Äôm now trying to do my very best to reallocate my funds.   Here‚Äôs what I have at the moment:  $12k in checking account $10k in 401k (haven‚Äôt been contributing but I am maxing it out this year and should have ~$28k by the end of the year)  $20k in Roth IRA  $103k in individual brokerage   Much of my holdings have been in ARK ETFs (I know this was an awful decision, but I was young and made some poor choices).   I‚Äôm wanting to exit those losing positions hopefully soon and sort out how else to allocate those funds. I will probably have the Roth IRA managed by my retirement company once I exit those positions so I don‚Äôt have to worry about it. I‚Äôll also be getting quite the tax harvest from the selling the positions in my brokerage account.   With all the losing positions I sell in my brokerage, I‚Äôll have ~40k of cash to do whatever with. The other ~$63k is invested in TSLA, Google, Microsoft, Apple, AMD &amp; AMZN. I have a $30k position in TSLA, so that‚Äôs most of it.   I‚Äôm thinking about taking the $40k I get from my losses and putting it in a HYSA, but not sure that would be the best thing to do. I think it would certainly be much less stressful than investing over $100k myself, but I also don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll need the money very soon.   I‚Äôm single and currently live in Denver (I hate it here), and would love to be able to go to a warmer place, potentially San Diego if I can afford it. I don‚Äôt know much about buying a house nor do I feel confident enough in a city to buy one, so still renting for now. My rent is 2.3k here, and would be much higher in a place like SD. I‚Äôm hoping to get a decent raise soon that would be closer to $200k, but not sure if it‚Äôs gonna play out yet or not.   Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Please be gentle because I know ARK was a mistake and I‚Äôm trying to do the right things now. I‚Äôm trying to get out of the mindset of recovering my losses through investments, and would like to be able to live more peacefully and not check the market every day.   Thank you!,;,; 2023-09-22 04:49:49]

[Mutual 'Fun' for my 3yo Son,;,; So for my son's first birthday (three years ago) I thought it would be fun to invest $1K and see where it would be when he turned 21. I asked all of his relatives to pick any stock or whatever, and then I bought fractional shares to spread out the $1K. I have a record of each initial stock purchase price (people picked everything from stuff that was hot then like NET, SPCE and PLTR to things they thought he'd identify with as he got older like DIS and NKE). Others played it safe and picked mutual funds. Anyway, the 'purity' of the initial $1K is gone because I've added more money (in small amounts) as people have given additional monetary birthday gifts etc. So now I have an imbalanced mishmash. I've been putting the 'new' money in safe places -- specifically VOO, SPY and BRKB. The total is still only about $2K but over the next 18 years I expect to continue to put modest amounts in and I am curious what people think. Should I hammer one mutual fund or spread it around? I have small slices of these stocks:        IMVT, CCL, SPOT, AFRM, ISRG, BABA, WMG, POOL, TWLO, MRNA, AAPL, BA, PBW, SYY, NET, ABNB, TSLA, NKE, ICLN, GM, NIO, PLTR, DIS, HAS, JWN, JMIA, SPCE, VXRT, NOVNQ.        I don't want to dump anything because it will be fun as my son gets older to connect the stock to a relative he will get to know.,;,; 2024-01-21 18:41:26]
[EUR 25000 in cash to invest, what's the quickest way to EUR 1M,;,; I am 45M.   For a long time, I kept my head in the sand about investing. Mutual funds, stocks, deposits - all were alien to me. Now that I read "Time in the market &gt; timing the market", I feel left out, and regret what I could have achieved if I had woken up earlier.  I have a EUR 8000 invested in a semiconductor fund that stands at 35% returns today - not bad. But far from enough.  Due to career volatility, not much in pension fund. Health is fine, as of now. The goal is to retire from 9-5 as early as possible, and start something that I love.   To inflate side income, there were so many things I wanted to try, and I simply wasted my time exploring them. Only now I am waking to investment, something that could have truly helped me achieve my goal)  As I read, the only way to make big wealth is to start early and exploit compounding - not something I have on my side. The only way is to pick better chips and forget about it for some time.   S &amp; P 500 is on my list. Are there other/better instruments?  I get that diversifying (in bonds, savings deposits) for security at this age is paramount.   Still, moderate risk is something I am not willing to rule out - anything for early independence.,;,; 2023-12-31 11:17:23]
[Early withdrawal from Roth IRA versus a brokerage account (money for my kids),;,; I'm retired,  with dependent children,  I am stashing money for their college.  Being 62, I am using a Roth IRA.  No, I am not funding their education with MY retirement money.  I am just using a retirement vehicle instead of a 529, and I'm up 26% so far this year. (thanks TSLA)       So what if i have MORE than $14K and i want to put it in their names for their future.   I'm thinking a Roth for them is a good option.    We can trade stocks and not have to sort out taxes every  year.      Say i manage to put $60K in the next five years and in 15 years it has grown to $150K and my son needs $100K to buy a house, so he pays the $10,000 penalty,  but what else will it cost him?   And why is this not better than using a brokerage account and settling with the IRS every year?,;,; 2023-06-16 14:36:26]
[EV hits another roadblock as Chile moves to nationalize lithium mines,;,; The markets do not like the news as lithium miners "crashed" today. This disrupts the EV battery supply chain and could wipe out lithium miners.   Chile recently installed it's left-wing President who is involved in drafting Chile's new Constitution which is deemed "too left-leaning and too radical."  If this happens, China and Chile will have the duopoly of lithium, and the US will be at the mercy of these two countries who would be able to dictate the price of lithium; just like Russia would dictate the price of oil and gas to the EU. As everyone knows economic sanctions will not do much.   This affects the US as it goes full scale of its EV infrastructure. California might need to rethink its discriminatory oil and gas policies.   While $TSLA is discounting its vehicles, others may not be able to do it. Most still cannot afford EV and the new tax credit system just complicates it. When Chile's done nationalizing it lithium mines, EV will just stay as a luxury vehicle.,;,; 2023-04-22 01:35:00]
[Seeking Feedback on my ETF Portfolio in Roth IRA: Diversification Concerns,;,; Hey fellow Redditors,  I've been diligently building my ETF portfolio in my Roth IRA, but lately, I've been questioning whether I have too many ETFs and if there's potential overlap or duplication issues. I want to ensure that my investments are as diverse as possible, but I'm not confident in my investing knowledge. That's why I need your expertise and feedback on my current holdings!  Here's my portfolio list:  1. Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) 2. MSCI Inc. (MSCI) 3. Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) 4. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) 5. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) 6. Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) 7. Fidelity Government Money Market Fund (SPAXX) 8. SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) 9. Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (VOO) 10. Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) 11. Vanguard Target Retirement 2060 Fund (VTTSX) 12. Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE)  I'm genuinely concerned that I may have too much overlap or duplicates among these ETFs, potentially undermining the diversification I was aiming for. Additionally, as a relatively inexperienced investor, I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on the overall health of my portfolio.,;,; 2023-06-18 19:46:50]
[Looking for Green Investments,;,; What are some green public traded companies to look into?  There are the obvious Solar/Wind/Battery companies $FSLR $SEDG $CSIQ $JKS $PCRFY $VSTA $TSLA I have a large position in some of these companies. I believe these will see exponential growth as we continue tobtransition off of fossil fuel energy as well as create more demand for electricity via web services, AI, and Electric Vehicles.  There are not so obvious companies like $FSI and $DAR   Flexible Solutions international makes two distinct products that focus on reducing evaporation from any large body of water from swimming pools and hot tubs to rivers and lakes. I believe this is considered a green company as their Water Savr product reduces the resources needed to replace evaporated water, and their Heat Savr product insulates and reduces resources needed to cool or heat pools etc.  Darling Ingredients focuses on recycling biowaste such as dead animals and extracting key ingredients to be sold as chemicals. They have quite a large operation and this is just one segment, but I believe they are considered a green company as they try to find alternatives to fossil fuels and other conventional sources for necessary chemicals and feed stocks.  Any suggestions appreciated.,;,; 2023-07-13 14:17:12]
[Seeking advice on holding 20+ year stocks and finance,;,; Wasn‚Äôt sure whether to post this here or on the daily discussion, so I did both.  Few months ago I began a savings and investment account for my son. I dumped about $1,500 in each two months ago. The plan is the build it up steadily until he reaches a certain life milestone such as buying first house, etc etc.     My current plan is putting $75 into the savings, and $75 into the investments every month. So far for the investments, I have...     TSLA, AMZN, DIS, GOOG, PCRFY, UUUU, and ASTS     I know most of these stocks are valued well over $75, but the plan is the just go in order and if I can't buy that one stock, waiting until the next month to do so then moving on.    It may not be the best plan, but it's what I've come up with. Any suggestions on stocks or routes to take would be appreciated, as my only resources / research (if you can call it that) are from reddit and YouTube.,;,; 2023-02-23 18:41:44]
[Navigating the Electric Vehicle Landscape as a New Investor,;,; Hey fellow investors!        I'm a relatively new investor, particularly focussing on long term investments. I spent most of 2023 learning the ropes of valuing companies and now I'm eager to explore a specific industry.        Lately, I've been drawn to the electric vehicle (EV) sector. While it's tempting to dream of picking the next Tesla, I'm mindful that savvy investors often analyze historical data, seeking common trends that make sense as the sector matures. This includes looking at the miners of essential metals, as well as the hardware and technology necessary for battery production.        To the seasoned investors out there, armed with your current knowledge, what advice would you share with your past selves when initially venturing into this space? Where should one start, and what pitfalls should be avoided?,;,; 2024-01-04 05:36:14]
[How to get rid of my trading habit to invest properly! Fear of losing the money!!,;,; I have built trading habit/mindset for many years due to lot of fear of losing the money, esp retirement account.  Over the past, I developed this habit of selling ETFs like QQQ/SMH and buying them back. This way, I secured my money (no loss) since 2021 December but a little gain appx 5% or less.  Even though I spot deep low good spot, I buy them some 10% or 20% of cash and sell them early to book profit, never had a guts to hold it.  Most of the times, I am missing the boat, continuous growth. I still feel bearish and trading then and there.  I recently tried bonds like TLT, but it went down from $98 to $95 range, sold it. I recently bought  APLY (thinking low volatility) around $19.5 but sold today by fear of losing money. When I buy, I think of hold long, but when I see nice jump or profit, my fear increases, selling it.  In my past, I bought TSLA at $41, NVDA at $55, FB at $50 and GOOGL $120. Had I kept those, I would have been multi millionaire by now, but sold everything with trading mindset.  Many of my friends told me, even close friend holding AAPL since 1998,  that trading not good, and try to make investing habits, but still my mind does not accept seeing huge negative on my account, say loss $10000.  I am mid 50s and naturally fear of losing money is common, but is trapped by trading mindset which I want to get rid of.  Read many books like Intelligent investor, Margin of safety etc and also reading many books, but that does not remove my fear of losing money.  I do not know whether I will be able to come out of not. If some one experienced like this and came out of that issue, please let me know how to get out of that.  Thanks in advance.  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-08-23 21:56:44]
[Selling my old home to pay for my new home,;,; Hello I am a 34yr old fully employed male looking to see if this is the best option for me.   I have a newly built home with a mortgage of 1,300 a month which I can pay out of my normal paycheck. So all the money coming from selling the old home is not needed it is all extra. I will be selling it soon for 300k. I was going to use it to just pay off the new home as it cost around 300k to build. The more I have looked into CD‚Äôs most are about 4.5% now it seems for around 6 months. I was thinking if I put this in a CD for 1 year total I would have 27,000 and after taxes would say 21,060. My house payment would equal 15,600 for 12 months. Would leave me 5,460 at the end of the year.   Is this correct? Should I do the CD route.   I am not a very risky person and not looking to make millions off of the money just looking for an even flow. I could pay for my home and still keep the 300k.   Or is there a better route. I just know this was the most secure route.  Like I say all of this money is just extra. Not needed for any payments or any life expenses.,;,; 2023-07-31 03:35:53]

[Investing in Artificial Intelligence,;,; Hi all,  AI has recently sparked my interest. It appears that it is inevitable that AI will be the next big breakthrough in human technology.   I am wondering if anyone can offer me insight into what ways I can invest into AI with some level of ‚Äòdiversification‚Äô.

[How Nasdaq 100 ‚ÄòSpecial Rebalance‚Äô on July 24 will affect tech stocks,;,; On July 7 [Nasdaq announced](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/the-nasdaq-100-index-special-rebalance-to-be-effective-july-24-2023-2023-07-07) its third-ever 'special rebalance' of the Nasdaq 100 index, which will take effect July 24, 2023.  As a result of the rebalance, you should expect Nasdaq to [significantly decrease the weight of the largest stocks](https://www.tastylive.com/news-insights/everything-you-need-to-know-about-what-will-happen-to-the-nasdaq-after-the-special-rebalance) ($MSFT, $AAPL, $GOOGL/$GOOG, $NVDA, and $AMZN) from a total of 43+% to below a 38.5% maximum. TSLA may also see a small downward weighting. Smaller stocks should see a small increase in the weight.  ETFs/mutual funds that try to follow the Nasdaq 100 (such as $QQQ) will need to adjust their holdings accordingly. So you should expect them to sell the largest stocks and buy the smaller ones -- perhaps they already have -- and that will affect the prices of those stocks accordingly.  It also means that those ETFs/mutual funds will not accurately reflect the relative weight of the largest stocks. So if you wish to be weighted according to actual market cap, you would need to supplement those holdings.  Normally the index rebalances every quarter. But the largest stocks are dominating the index and funds that follow the index need to maintain compliance with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule on fund diversification. On July 3, the largest six stocks saw their combined weight reach 50.9% of the index.

[Tesla stock grab ultimatum,;,; I just saw this on CNN and may be the first time I ever heard of something like this. Elon Musk is (practically) demanding he have his voting power **doubled** in the company. This after he sold huge chunks, such as to finance buying Twitter.   &gt;  In a series of posts on X Monday night, Musk said that he would not want to grow Tesla to become a leader in artificial intelligence and robotics without a compensation plan that would give him ownership of around 25% of the company‚Äôs stock. That would be about double the roughly 13% stake he currently owns.  &gt; ‚ÄúI am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI &amp; robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can‚Äôt be overturned,‚Äù Musk wrote in a post on X. ‚ÄúUnless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.‚Äù  So the 2nd block he‚Äôs essentially threatening to spin off and make competition.   But how does a public company address this? If they awarded him some GIGANTIC options, it would massively dilute existing shares. If they made another voting class of shares, x20,000 voting rights, they could just give a small pile of those, but what Board could transfer 12% voting interest in a public company based on some tweets? How would that be upholding their corporate responsibilities?  Is this some insider key to the sell off they‚Äôve been experiencing? Cuz it‚Äôs frankly scary to me. And it‚Äôs scary because I think he might get it. Which does a lot to undercut the trust I have in the Board. I had been thinking of doing an option on them if they dropped to maybe 200-205. But this is just an ugly ultimatum that seems capable of vastly changing the value of the company.   OR am I blowing things out of proportion?

[How Much Is Tesla Worth? You Decide,;,; Wall Street Journal out with an article that lets you plug in 5 simple variables to get a valuation for Tesla.  The 5 variables are: how many cars Tesla sells in 2030, average selling price of a Tesla car in 2030 in today‚Äôs dollars, operating margin, cost of capital, and how much Tesla‚Äôs other operations are worth.  The Wall Street Journal has 4 pre-set scenarios:  1. Bearish - $58.5 billion valuation based on 5 million cars at $30k with 8% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $0 valuation for other operations besides cars  2. Default - $381 billion valuation based on 7 million cars at $30k with 10% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $200 billion valuation for other operations.  3. Bullish - $770 billion valuation based on 10 million cars at $30k with 12% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, $400 billion for other operations  4. Superfan - $2.33 trillion valuation based on 20 million cars at $30k with 15% operating margin, 8% cost of capital, $600 billion for other operations  Their assumptions are as follows:  &gt; Our model is based on estimates of Tesla‚Äôs future cash flows. It multiplies anticipated vehicle sales in 2030 by the average anticipated price to calculate revenue, and then applies the expected operating margin to arrive at operating profit. Estimates for the years before 2030 assume a smooth path in the variables from this year‚Äôs FactSet analyst consensus.  &gt; Operating profit is taxed at an 11% rate (FactSet consensus for Tesla in 2023). Cash flows are then calculated as posttax operating profit minus capital expenditures while adding back depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures are assumed to be a flat 7% of revenue and depreciation and amortization 20% of capital expenditures.  &gt; Estimated cash flows through 2030 are discounted back to their present value at the discount rate and aggregated. A terminal value is added to account for Tesla‚Äôs cash flows beyond 2030, assuming a steady-state growth rate of 5%. The total of all these discounted estimated cash flows gives the theoretical enterprise value of Tesla‚Äôs core automotive business now.  &gt; We have left the value of its other businesses as a separate assumption within the model to arrive at a total enterprise value. Market value would also include the company‚Äôs cash or debt position, which we have not modeled.  Personally, as a Tesla bull who owns the stock, I believe Tesla is worth north of $1 trillion based on 10 million cars at $38k and 17% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, and $200B for other operations. I also believe that assuming 5% terminal growth post 2030 is too low.   What do you think?  https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/how-much-is-tesla-worth-you-decide-78b25ab1,;,; 2023-09-28 15:07:54]

[Apple and Tesla may no longer be ‚Äòsafe investments‚Äô as China‚Äôs troubles grow,;,; **From Marketwatch:**  &gt; China represented a 19% chunk of Apple‚Äôs revenue in 2023, and roughly 22% for Tesla in the first nine months of last year.   This makes them ‚Äúthe two most China exposed companies,‚Äù of the Magnificent Seven.   &gt; Apple recently cut handset prices in the China where it battles competitors like Huawei.

China is also in the midst of population woes and a stagnating economy. With US sanctions fears adding fuel.   **From Barrons:**  &gt; We expect the sequential growth momentum of the Chinese economy to stabilize at a subdued level over the course of 2024, with annual growth slowing to 4.4% in 2024 as the reopening effects fade, the property sector remains a drag, and government policies focus on containing downside risks rather than providing a major growth boost,‚Äù wrote Julius Baer economist Sophie Altermatt in a research note on Wednesday.  &gt; Shaky consumer confidence and concerns over China‚Äôs demographics‚Äîthe population shrank for the second year in a row in 2023‚Äîare bad news for the e-commerce operations that big Chinese technology companies have built their businesses on.  **EDIT:** Crikey guys, I‚Äôm just quoting news to hopefully enrich this sub.

[ExxonMobil passed Tesla as the most shorted stock last month. Here are the 10 names investors are betting against the most.,;,; ExxonMobil was the most shorted large-cap stock in the S&amp;P 500 last month, according to HazelTree.    Tesla and Apple followed the energy giant in the large-cap sector, according to data from HazelTree.    Fund managers tracked by the firm also bet heavily against Rivian, SNAP, Ford, and AirBnB.  ExxonMobil Corp replaced Tesla as the most-shorted large-cap stock in the S&amp;P 500, according to a report from HazelTree.        Before last month, Elon Musk's car company had held the top spot as the most shorted stock for four consecutive months. When investors short a stock, they are betting that a company's share price will decline.         HazelTree ranks short bets with a "Crowdedness Score" of one to 99, with the highest level representing shares shorted by the greatest percentage of funds tracked by HazleTree. The firm collects data on 12,000 global equities and over 700 funds.        In the large-cap group, ExxonMobil and Tesla led the way with scores of 99 and 97, respectively, followed by Apple (94), Charter Communications (91), Broadcom (91), Rivian Automotive (86), US Bank Corp (83), SNAP (83), Ford (78), and AirBnB (78).         The three most-shorted names in the mid-cap sector included SOFI Technologies (99), American Airlines (92), and EV maker Lucid (92).         The report also highlighted the percentage of institutional investors' supply of a particular stock to be loaned to short sellers. In order to short a stock, an investor betting against a particular name must borrow the shares. It then sells them immediately. If the share price fall as expected, the short seller buys the shares back and returns them to the lender and pockets the difference in price.         HazelTree said it tracks how "hot" a stock is in terms of supply and demand from short sellers.         Rivian Automotive led the way in institutional supply utilization at 37%, well above ExxonMobil's 3.13% and Tesla's 2.67%.         Exxon is down about 6% year-to-date, while Tesla has gained a whopping 76% this year but is dealing with headwinds stemming from uncertain demand for electric vehicles and stiff competition that has led to price cuts on its vehicles over the course of 2023. ,;,; 2023-11-09 17:15:56]

[Taking advantage of a panic sell.,;,; 90% of portfolio is in boring low risk etf‚Äôs or bonds. I‚Äôm more concerned with putting a large amount of my income away than maximizing returns.

[20 stocks till 2049 - buy and hold for 25 years,;,; Hello. Apologies if this has already been posted in this community.   I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.  https://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e  The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.  So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold.   So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049.   Here is my list so far.   1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 ) 2. Costco 3. Johnson and Johnson 4. Waste Management 5. CVS 6. Home Depot 7. Boeing 8. Caterpillar 9. GE Aerospace 10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia 11. Walmart/Target 12. Starbucks / McDonalds 13. UPS 14. JP Morgan / Bank of America 15. Berkshire / Markel 16. Disney 17. Tesla / GM 18. Hershey 19. Dollar General 20. Lockheed Martin  Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate.   Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.  Edit: Some really good points in the comments.   1. Most of my regular investing goes to VOO. Think of this as a fun little experiment  2. Since all of these are mature large companies, maybe it makes more sense to go with mid cap stocks. In that case, what would you pick?,;,; 2024-01-18 21:13:00]

I think at worst the US will perform similarly to these countries, and at best will keep on being the driver of innovation/tech in the world due simply to its culture of innovation and hardcore capitalism (which has many, many cons).

I didn't even start to "make money fast" like other people do, but really just to educate myself on some companies and learn something about idiosyncratic risk etc. I started with 900 Euro (about 1000 $) and managed to almost triple that amount in the span of two years.

[Query - What has more impact on an index like NASDAQ-100?,;,; NASDAQ-100 closed at 12302.48 yesterday. The previous close was 12290.81. So it gained 11.67 points yesterday. Now percentage wise, the highest price gain was by Enphase Energy, Inc. (ENPH) 3.77% 1.11 Billion, but the increase in market capitalization was highest by Apple (AAPL) 1.85%  41.5 Billion.   According to Wikipedia, NASDAQ-100 is "modified capitalization-weighted index." So am I right in my inference that though ENPH went up by 3.77%, this would have a much lesser impact on the index price than AAPL going up by 1.85%?     Similarly, Dexcom (DXCM) was the biggest loser at -7.87% (-3.63 B), but Tesla was biggest loser as per market cap -2.01% ( -13.98 B).

Last year, their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S&amp;P 500's valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65% of the Index's market cap gain last year, despite comprising just 1.4% of its components. But doesn't this go against the main reason behind investing in S&amp;P 500 index funds? Wouldn't the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed?  &gt; Phil Van Dorn: Well, I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry, traditionally, you might be looking at expenses of 1% of assets under management per year, and that can really pile up over time. But with an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund, your expenses get close to zero. But as you have mentioned when you called the group of expensive stocks the Trillionaires' Club, a small group of companies now make up between 27 and 30% of the S&amp;P 500 depending on which day you look at it.  &gt; Jeremy Owens: Right, so that's seven out of 500 companies accounting for more than a quarter or less than a third of the entire market cap of the S&amp;P 500 and really swaying the underlying metrics. What should an investor kind of take from this and how should we look at the S&amp;P 500 moving forward, knowing how much these companies matter?  &gt; Phil Van Dorn: One can say that there's a heck of a lot of risk in the seven companies that make up only 1% of the S&amp;P 500, but make up close to a third of its value. However, the S&amp;P 500 is self-correcting. It rewards success.,;,; 2024-01-20 00:51:08]
[Has anyone heard that a portfolio balanced equally by sector will beat the S&amp;P 500 over time?,;,; I was just speaking with a (potential) financial advisor today. He discussed, for example how the S&amp;P 500 is way overweighted in tech, particularly because 7 of the top 10 holdings are all megatech giants: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, Google/Alphabet (twice), and Tesla. These 7 alone make up 21% of the value of the S&amp;P 500.  Obviously, this leads to underweighting in other sectors. And this leads to underperformance and increased volatility over long periods of time. As evidence of this, he brought up a chart that showed that if you equally weight your investments across the various sectors (financials, materials, utilities, healthcare, etc.), that it would outperform the S&amp;P 500, provided that you rebalance periodically.  Has anyone heard of an investment portfolio like this? I did a little research, and it looks like for periods of 15 years or greater, this is right - an portfolio that's equally weighted by sector, and rebalanced periodically, will outperform the S&amp;P by 1.5% to 2% annually.  I'd love to hear your thoughts about this. Anyone have a portfolio like this? Is there some kind of equal weighting ETF or mutual fund that does this automatically? Thanks.,;,; 2023-02-28 09:15:41]
[Growth Stocks Ideas Non-Tech,;,; I‚Äôve been trying to help my dad set up a new portfolio. We‚Äôve decided to go with a split between dividends, and value/growth. I‚Äôve taken care of the dividends side of things with him already, but I‚Äôm looking for some growth stocks that he can trade short-term (short term being a time interval of a few weeks to a few months or a year or two). I‚Äôve already taken care of the ETFs side of things, so please, stock recommendations only.  However, he seems to not want to invest in many tech companies, so things like AI or TESLA are out of the pictures. I e tried researching online for growth opportunities in other sectors, and have found a few things, but am wondering if any of you might have some suggestions for me to look into.  One final note. I noticed he prefers stocks that have a current share price below $100. Not a dealbreaker, but it‚Äôs what he‚Äôs more comfortable with I guess. I know it doesn‚Äôt really matter, but it‚Äôs his call.  Thanks.,;,; 2023-08-06 01:16:37]
[What industries are you most bullish on this year? Also what stocks / ETFs are you buying right now to hold long term?,;,; I‚Äôm paying close attention to a small number of industries in 2024 ranging from oil tankers to food supply-chain track &amp; trace, however, lithium is at the very top of my watchlist.   The lithium supply chain (prospectors, mines, refineries, et al) will be within the blast radius of massive tailwinds as the demand for lithium will continue growing at an expedited rate with a compound annual growth rate of 12% to 20% (depending on what you read).     EV‚Äôs are the obvious lithium catalyst driven by strict adoption mandates across the EU, US, and Asia. For context on this, a Tesla model S' battery contains around 62.6 kg (138 pounds) of lithium and roughly 2 billion EVs need to be on the road by 2050 for the world to hit net zero emissions - the demand / growth potential of lithium industry is something unprecedented. There‚Äôs not much to compare it with and no, it hasn‚Äôt been ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù.     Also, let‚Äôs not forget the impact of global relations on lithium and other base metal supply chains. We‚Äôre seeing a repatriation of the manufacturing base back to the western world which in this case will favour domestic and near shore lithium projects (Canada and Mexico will likely be the biggest beneficiaries of this).   I‚Äôm currently placing my long term bets in the industry and am bullish on a small number of stocks:   $ALB - My safety net play   One of the biggest lithium juggernauts rn with an extensive global portfolio. They hold the title of largest provider of lithium for EV batteries in the world. Albemarle is on a path of industry consolidation via aggressive M&amp;A (This trend is expected to continue in 2024 and beyond).     $LIFT.V - My parabolic growth play   One of the most robust early stage lithium projects I‚Äôve come across in Northern America. If you know anything about junior miners you know how drill test results play a key role in assessing the potential value of a company/stock. I recommend reading into these. Just by looking at publicly available drill hole data, I believe we could see a total resource of 60+ million tonnes, which would mean and estimate 1-1.4 million tonnes LCE resource. (Lithium carbonate equivalent). For context, anything worth 1million tonnes is likely to attract major institutional capital.   Does anyone else share by bullish outlook? What are your 2024 lithium/metals bets?  &amp;#x200B;     ,;,; 2024-01-16 21:12:42]
[So I'm pretty broke, is $1500 worth having in VTI?,;,; Hello. I put 500$ into VTI a couple months ago and it seem like an investment that could really grow so I put another $1000 into it and it's performed pretty well in my very amateur opinion. But overall I'm not sure if I should be doing anything else with this money or keep a safe EFT that I slowly added into it, even if at most I'd probably only be able to add maybe a few hundred more a year?   I do have another $1000 l've kept in a 3.5% savings account, and I wouldn't have to worry about food or shelter any amount of time if I lost my job or some other financial emergency, my healthcare and food money is provided for me.,;,; 2023-11-20 19:05:36]
[Seeking Feedback on my ETF Portfolio in Roth IRA: Diversification Concerns,;,; Hey fellow Redditors,  I've been diligently building my ETF portfolio in my Roth IRA, but lately, I've been questioning whether I have too many ETFs and if there's potential overlap or duplication issues. I want to ensure that my investments are as diverse as possible, but I'm not confident in my investing knowledge. That's why I need your expertise and feedback on my current holdings!  Here's my portfolio list:  1. Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) 2. MSCI Inc. (MSCI) 3. Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) 4. Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) 5. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) 6. Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) 7.

Vanguard Target Retirement 2060 Fund (VTTSX) 12. Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE)  I'm genuinely concerned that I may have too much overlap or duplicates among these ETFs, potentially undermining the diversification I was aiming for. Additionally, as a relatively inexperienced investor, I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on the overall health of my portfolio.,;,; 2023-06-18 19:46:50]
[Need advice on allocation,;,; Hello, guys. I need your opinion. I am in my early 30s and I am planning on investing ~200k. I have just made Fidelity Roth IRA account and will be maxing out contributions there (prob 100% VTI) and planning on allocating rest of the funds. I know that portfolio will heavily depend on individual‚Äôs risk tolerance, but i was wondering if this break down makes sense in terms of risk management.

Here‚Äôs my rough plan:   30% VOO  30% VTI -&gt; ‚ùóÔ∏èsuggested to VT  20% Fidelity SPAXX that has interest rate of ~4.97% (i assume this is default for cash sitting in Fidelity brokerage account, please correct me if i am wrong)  -&gt; ‚ùóÔ∏èsuggested to be increased, maybe incorporate other HYSA/CD?  20% into actual stocks - im thinking about around 10-15 conpanies, candidates being tech companies like Nvidia, AMD, Amazon, Apple, Tesla and non-tech companies like Berkshire Hathaway (prob will need ~5 more good retail/nontech companies) -&gt; ‚ùóÔ∏èsuggested to be decreased, if not 0.     My goal is to hopefully go aggressive enough for 10~15% gains per year and later, put half into mortgage downpayment. -&gt; ‚ùóÔ∏èrealistic annual return ~7%  I would appreciate your comment and advice, any other potential investment recommendations would be great.

[Compounding interest and issue with exchange rate,;,; I have this issue with the exchange as I am in the UK and holding GBP in my account.  I am buying the stocks when the price is low and once the price goes up I am selling and the purchase more stocks with the the profit earned . For example I bought tesla Stock at a $181.33 , then I sold some shares at $262.03.  After that I reinvested the same amount back into the at $252.2.

What would add?,;,; Edit--What would \*YOU\* add? -\_-  &amp;#x200B;  I'm currently trying to brainstorm things that may factor into the decision to invest in a company that doesn't rely wholly on impulse. Here are some potential categories that may eventually turn into some sort of journaling or flowchart. I'd love your input as well.  \-What is the short interest? (How many days to cover all shorts based on average volume and total shorted shares? 8 days supposedly it gets hairy for bears)  \-What is the volatility?  \-What pattern is emerging or is it trading?  \-Why is it trading higher or lower? (faith in the product, news, cult of personality, faith in leadership, hedging against presumed cycles, et cetera)  \-Is it near support or resistance?  \-What is the price in relation to moving averages? (9, 20, 50, 200 day)  \-Has there recently been a cross up/down?(Seemingly very reactive on the 4 hour chart)  \-Is it filling a gap?  \-What volume is the price based on? (One trader accidentally paying way over market value at 5 AM doesn't mean everyone is going to pay that)  \-Are fund managers likely buying? (you don't affect the market, they do)  \-Is this a long-term or a short-term play?  \-Some people trade the same stocks every day--What does the chart tell you about their habits? (Does volume drop off at a certain time? Do bears take over early only for the stock to rebound? Does everyone seem to take a long lunch away from their trade station?)  \-Price to book ratio? (If they liquidated today, how much would they still have?)  \-Is this stock moving in sympathy with and industry? (Are there cheaper stocks in this industry trading in sympathy that you could increase profit potential with?)  \-What's coming down the pike? (For instance, currently Tesla is dominating because their charging stations are becoming the industry standard. Also in the news is that Honda and other companies are signing on to an agreement to use blockchain to trace the footprint of the minerals used in their batteries. If this becomes a regulation/requirement, will Tesla drop if less-than-scrupulous sources of lithium are discovered?)  \-Based on your own experience, what might you be able to forecast that others may not due to proximity? (E.G. How many fuel trucks can you see going into the pipelines, how many new fracking rigs can you see from the road, What are the names on the rigs? Et cetera)((Ben Graham said not to invest in things you don't understand, right? You don't understand AI--stay out))  \-Before earnings, what products have you noticed more of in your daily life?  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-06-21 00:17:40]

[S&amp;p 500 Tech vs NASDAQ 100 vs Stocks for AI,;,; Greetings!     I wanna invest into AI and cant decide whats the best call there. I think most will agree that the best bet for AI is to invest into the Big Companys: Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Meta, Google and Amazon. (Tesla not included because i dont like Elon tbh).     Investing into S&amp;P Tech will give me big Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA but not the other companys. Investing into NASDAQ 100 will give me all of them, but with a lower Rate (can be good can be bad). And of course i just can buy those 6 Stocks.     I think Apple (even if they dont have LLMs yet) will be big in AI in 1-2 Years and the capability shipping local AI on all of their devices are insane.  Huge potential here + we talk about Apple. Microsoft is playing the AI game better than anyone else right now and coming GPT Versions will slap. I also like the new approach of Meta and with LLAMA there is also huge Potential. NVIDIA is of course also a no brainer (even if some ppl think they are overvalued), they are way ahead of other companys like AMD right now. Amazon while not having insane LLMs right now, has of course on of the best Sectors to apply AI in general.     With alphabet i have to say, im not so sure. Their new Model is strong, but i kinda didn't feel good about the company as a whole. Hard to explain why.      What would you do and why if AI is the goal ?

[What Am I Missing in my Analysis?,;,; Edit: People seem to have a TSLA fixation and think I want to buy it. That's not the case. I don't care what your opinion of TSLA is. I've done my analysis of all the stocks mentioned below according to the analysis mentioned below. Tell me where my analysis falls short and what other methods I should consider (that don't involve technical analysis).   Seeing some recent rave reviews about TSLA, ADBE, and FDX lately. Talking about the charging method Tesla uses becoming the standard in North America and being adopted by SAE, Adobe's investments in generative AI, and Fedex being able to pick up some slack if UPS workers go on strike, as well as some other investments and innovations they've been making.  But the problem is, I just don't see them valued at good prices.   FDX is trading at almost 2.5x book and 21x earnings  ADBE is trading at 15x book, almost 47x earnings, and 12x revenue per share  TSLA is trading at almost 17x book, almost 74x earnings, and over 9x revenue per share.  From a valuation standpoint (P/B, P/E, and P/S), those numbers are completely unjustifiable when considering buying.  So is there something I'm missing? Something I'm failing to consider? It seems like in the case of TSLA and ADBE their tech advancements could be a competitive advantage. Or are these types of stocks just wildly overhyped and overpriced? Because from a valuation perspective (P/B, P/E, and P/S) things like DINO, PBR, TSN, NTR, X, HMC, WFG, BIO, and BNTX look like great buys - why wouldn't I just buy those. They seem much more fairly priced, even cheap...  So what am I missing? What else do I need to consider in my analysis, if anything?,;,; 2023-06-29 03:56:18]

[Need help unloading Apple,;,; Hi all,   Sorry in advance on formatting, I‚Äôm writing this on my phone.   My wife (28F) and I (35M) are going to be diversifying from apple and would love your opinions. I will give a brief background about us and also our financial situation.   My wife is finishing her masters program in the spring of 24 and will be making about 100k a year. She will have about 70k in student debt. I am in tech and earn about 175-250k with zero debt. We have 1 daughter who is 3 years old. We live in a HCOL area in Northern California and fortunately have a paid off residence.   The allocations below are held in a trust which took a 90k loss last year and gives us the opportunity to reduce allocation % in apple. Essentially we will be selling 90,000 in capital gains (roughly 690+ shares) and diversifying.   (Trust) Apple shares - 3,250 ($572,975) Shwab CD - $125,000 (4.1% &amp; expiring in October 2023)  Cash - 14.5k  Personal brokerage  Apple shares - 620 ($109,306) Nvidia shares - 15 ($6,720 Tesla - 10 ($2,670) 529 account - ($4,000) VTI - $22,420 (Roth ira) 401k - $101,000 (VTSAX) Cash - 35k  Our Schwab advisor is pushing for a self directed index through Schwab. The Schwab advisor  wants us to harvest losses in the future so we can diversify apple to even out the allocations. Minimum investment amount is 100k into this self directed index fund. Our longLong term goal is wanting to have a 10-15% allocation in apple.   My question to the group is, what should my next step be? I‚Äôm a little skeptical about a self directed index fund because it‚Äôs a Schwab robo advisor with .4% fees. Should i just sell 75% of the entire trust and VTI or VOO it? We are very fortunate to be in this situation but are losing sleep at night with everything in 1 stock.   Thank you in advance!,;,; 2023-09-18 20:52:56]
[Is China set for "finally" bottom and an epic rally?,;,; DISCLAIMER: This post can disturb US readers:     What a f\* value evaporation we went through in the last years. China, with the bad press from the US major media and subsequently Markets realigning with US policy (decoupling) left the stock market in the lows. You have companies like $BABA that IPOed at $68 per share on Sept. 14, 2014, and last week this thing was touching that price. But let's compare BABA business and valuation quickly:     |In Millions|2014|2023| |:-|:-|:-| |Revenues|52,504 RMB or $8,463|868,687 RMB or $126,491| |Profits|23,403 RMB or  $3,720 |156,906 RMB or $22,583| |Share Price|\+/- 119$|\+/- 70$|  When China was friendly to the US eyes, the share price of BABA peaked at $300 and I remember that still it was considered a "value play" compared to its peers (FAANG or 7MAG)  China has disappointed the market with news (news from US media, reality is always different) and I beleive not a single news can disspoint investors further other than a very extreme US hollywood-driven wet dream of China invading Taiwan (it won't happen militarily, they follow a different policy with a period of 50 to 100 years planning and execution - as they work on long-term leadership, not 4 years elections circus)  Their economy is still doing better than ours in europe or the US, but they aren't active participants of press releases, conference meeting for the front page of Financial Times or election year where US population take it as a sport match.  * BYD took over TESLA.  * eCommerce in China and South Asia is BABA/Tencent playground moving trillions * They were the first to release 5G and subsequently US had to take them down with some drama story on Huawei  China state intervened their high growth sectors and companies bcuz their CEOs thought that they could monetise on Chinese publicly-funded resources and create an oligopoly equivalent to the US where Googles, Amazons dominate the citizens privacy, freedom and life.

As Zuckerberg stated:  [*‚ÄúBy the end of this year, we‚Äôre going to have around 350,000 Nvidia H100s.

I don't think other big tech (Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS) giants will order more GPUs because running a general-purpose GPU is very expensive: [Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company. Each query costs roughly 4 cents, according to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/)   Google already has its own ASICs chips called TPU.    Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family.      Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.  And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers.     Small businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud capacities (mostly Google because of their TPU's low power-to-cost ratio).      The rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent.      **\[Conclusions\]:** Their a moderate-low probability Q4 revenues will reach a plateau of around 15-20 billion.  A moderate probability that they will be below 15 billion. A low probability of exceeding 20 billion.  &amp;#x200B;  ***Let's sidestep to AI marker TAM topic,***        [*Meanwhile, looking forward to 2027, the server market's value is estimated at a staggering $195.6 billion.*](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-ai-and-hpc-gpu-sales-reportedly-approached-half-a-million-units-in-q3-thanks-to-meta-facebook)   However, this estimated revenue will be brought by those who rent AI processing capacities like AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud providers. And not ChatGPT clones. The market has not figured yet the TAM (total addressable market) of services like ChatGPT.       However, I try to speculate on [open numbers](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users), which have stagnated for the last 6 months.      100 million monthly active users \* 10$ per subscription produces 1 billion in revenue.    [The average cost of 1 query from a used is 4 cents](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/).     A single user runs 2,000 queries per month on average. The query is a single text message you send to the chatbot.      2000 \* 0.04 = 80 $ to service 1 user per month.    Until the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month.    No wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription.  It doesn't seem sustainable.     Last note,  the majority of data centers upgrade their equipment every 4-5 years. So, if AI expectations won't burst, and chip efficiency improves 10-fold, and other chip makers won't catch up, don't expect big tech to re-stock their chips earlier than the end of 2027.      &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2024-01-21 22:17:52]

[What allocation approach is implied by Toby Nangle's new FT article on narrow markets driving equity returns?,;,; What I take from the article below is not to rely too much on a macro-driven asset allocation strategy.  But what asset allocation strategy makes sense in this environment then?    &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;   www.ft.com /content/c5d7ee71-92a2-4840-9344-2f62e9642e61  # Narrow markets should humble macro forecasters  5-6 minutes   2023-08-08   Toby Nangle    The writer is a former global head of asset allocation at a fund manager   This year has been marked by strong equity markets, and what looks to be an astonishingly narrow rally. Of the 16.9 per cent returned by the S&amp;P 500 index in the first half of this year, 12.9 per cent derived from the performance of only 10 companies.   With such a high proportion of a market‚Äôs value created by so few groups, it feels fair to question the tool kits of asset allocators and, more broadly, the product line-up of fund management firms.   Narrow stock market returns are, after all, the norm. Research by Arizona State University professor Hendrik Bessembinder shows that more than half of the $55.1tn in net wealth generated by the US equity market between 1926 and 2022 came from the performance of fewer than 0.3 per cent of the market‚Äôs stocks, with the other half of this net wealth coming from the next best 3.1 per cent of stocks.   Moreover, almost three-fifths of stocks actually destroyed wealth over the period. In quant-speak, the distribution of compound stock returns has been very positively skewed.   In addition, the skewness of equity returns turns out not to be a particularly North American phenomenon. Indeed, in the three decades ending in December 2020 the proportion of net wealth contributed by the best 1 per cent of emerging market stocks was more than 80 per cent.   Looking at the entire global stock universe outside the US, the proportion rises still further to more than 90 per cent. Winners have won big. Most individual stocks over the past 30 years have failed to outperform dollars stored under the mattress, let alone a local currency interest-bearing cash deposits ‚Äî even after taking into account dividends.   Bessembinder‚Äôs work has typically been surveyed in terms of what it means for active stockpickers ‚Äî with some seeing it as a rationalisation for chasing moonshots and others for pursuing passive index-investing. Less examined has been what it means for asset allocators.   Developed market stock index returns have been dominated by global companies ‚Äî even if they each carry a domestic tilt. As such, connecting local macroeconomic developments to the performance of a region‚Äôs equity index can be something of a dark art.   Single large stocks with an economic fate that has little to do with their listing jurisdiction have dominated national index returns. For example, the photolithography machine-maker ASML accounts for more than a fifth of the total net wealth created by Dutch stocks in the 30 years up to 2020. Global fast-fashion retailer Inditex accounts for more than a sixth of Spanish stock returns. Global luxury brands LVMH and L‚ÄôOr√©al collectively account for almost a quarter of the returns from French stocks. These are not outliers. One cannot explain long-term returns without reference to such companies in pretty much any region.   If it becomes hard to explain equity index returns without reference to specific superstar groups, it stands to reason that it must be even harder to forecast equity index returns without taking a view on some individual companies. It‚Äôs easy today to focus on whether the Magnificent Seven that have powered the S&amp;P 500 rally ‚Äî Apple, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta ‚Äî might stumble. With more than a quarter of the US market‚Äôs valuation riding on them, the question is not at all trivial. But 30 years ago, five of these seven had not even listed. It‚Äôs hard to take a view on companies that don‚Äôt yet exist.   I‚Äôve been as guilty as the next asset allocator in explaining my preference for US over European stocks or vice versa with reference to some domestic macroeconomic outlook. Given that financials, utilities and property groups will carry a strong domestic flavour, this is still forgivable.   But when constructing a long-term strategic asset allocation, it is becoming increasingly untenable to justify regional preferences with reference to local macroeconomic forecasts. This may explain why long-term return forecasts for equity markets ‚Äî or Capital Market Assumptions, as they are known ‚Äî have such a lousy record.   The biggest single investment decision any institutional or individual investor is likely to make in their portfolio is their choice of strategic asset allocation. To create a strategic asset allocation one must make reasonable guesses about future market returns. Bessembinder‚Äôs research shows quite how invariably such reasonable guesses will be blindsided by the fate of single stocks.,;,; 2023-08-08 12:11:15]

[Lifecore: Opportunity or Bust?,;,; Been following Lifecore (ticker: LFCR) for the past few of days. I believe the stock is a compelling long but would appreciate some pushback.  Lifecore is an oddity in the pharma industry. It has two main business branches in two very different sectors. One is the CDMO business that manufactures injectables for drug companies. Another one is their commodity Curation Foods business. Salad, avocado, olive oil, etc. This combination makes no sense at all but if you ever read Joel Greenblatt's fancy title books you'd be intrigued by possible shift in business mix. Perhaps a spin-off or other corporate action would unlock shareholder value...  Well that's exactly what is happening right now. On March 16th, Lifecore made three important announcements.  1. 2023 Q2 results with 11% revenue decline, going concern notice, and statements on breach of covenants. 2. Expansion of contract with existing customer including 10m upfront payment in cash and up to 15m capex reimbursement. 3. Statement on looking for strategic alternative.  So what does this mean for the stock? First trading day after the announcement, the market reacted violently. The stock plunged 70%. High debt level combined with going concern notice and exploration of strategic alternative is almost never a happy marriage and it wasn't a great start. Moreover, in months leading to Q2 announcement, Lifecore issued a note telling investors that previously issued financial statements should no longer be relied upon due to errors found in its Curation Foods business. Doomed! Or so it seemed. Interestingly, the stock went up 80% on the following trading day and has since held its ground in $3-4 range despite reasonably high borrow fees for shorting this name. Perhaps there's more to the story.  I decided to go over the business this past weekend and found a few more interesting items.  1. The company has an activist investor on the board and has been selling off its Curation Foods business for the last few years. They sold their avocado segment this year and now olive oil sale completes the sale of Curation Foods segment. Prior to this sale, I believe this was the last remaining thorn in Lifecore path towards receiving forbearance from lenders as well as attracting the best possible bids. Lifecore is finally a pure CDMO play well positioned to capture bids from both financial and strategic buyers. These assets are highly valued and often trade at EV/EBITDA multiple of larger than 15 due to regulatory and technical reasons. Lifecore guided around 32.5 million before the meltdown and winning their largest contract to date would most likely push EBITDA run rate to \~40m. 2. The revenue decline only happened for non-material reasons. Their customer pushed the schedule back by a quarter or two and hence the quarter numbers looked disappointing. But this means next quarter or the following one should have higher than normal numbers. 3. The liquidity statement is most likely the result of covenant breach and they should have enough cash on hand to run the business. Why? They just sold their avocado business for 17.5m (goes into paying down debt) and got 38.75m in converts with $7 strike price. They have enough cash to run the business and fund their capex. My best guess is that miscalculating the timing of (2) probably had some impact on the covenants and they now need to negotiate the terms with lenders. Right now these debts are callable at any moment and that's probably why they needed to issue the liquidity statement. Technically, they don‚Äôt have enough cash right now to meet the theoretical obligations that could arise from accelerated debt payment. Does it make sense for creditors to call the debts? No. They are much better off letting the sale process go through and getting a kick back for granting forbearance. 4. They hired Morgan Stanley for their strategic alternative process. If Morgan Stanley is the Morgan Stanley I know, they would not advise companies on a tiny 6 million dollar deal that may or may not go through. It's not the olive oil deal that needs Morgan Stanley. This is most likely the sale of the entire company. For what it's worth, when I interviewed for Morgan Stanley internship a while ago, the interviewer told me that they don't look at deals below 500m--pretty sure they do look at smaller deals as well but guessing it's the minority. I went to buyside straight out of college so don't have any first hand experience there but is more or less in line with conversations I had with friends in bulge bracket banks. Moreover, Morgan Stanley advised on a similar deal last year when Alcami traded hands. Lifecore has the right advisor. 5. The interest level in CDMO asset is wild. They have been steadily growing and industry experts I've spoken to all agree that they are most likely getting dozens of bids right now. Given that board owns significant amount of shares and the company has set its sight on sale process, we have the right conditions for maximization of shareholder returns. 6. The short interest increased going into the belated Q2 announcement on March 16th and since then FINRA data suggests that good amount of shorting has taken place. Historically, high short interest led to poor stock performance but occasionally you see stocks like Gamestop and Tesla that totally burns the short sellers. Given that I believe LFCR is a misunderstood situation and borrow fees are relatively high, the elevated short interest offers more reason to yield significant return should forbearance be granted and going concern notice removed.  Why are some people short this name?  Short thesis for this name is fairly straightforward. You have a company with business not matching the debt structure. The loans are current and they don‚Äôt have sufficient cash to meet all obligations. They just issued 38.75m in convertibles and even then they breached the covenants so the future looks bleak. Short!  On the other hand, the value of CDMO asset and high borrow rate make such thesis highly risky for the shorts and favorable for those looking at this name from the long side. What is this worth? We can look at other CDMO transactions for some guidance. Somewhat recent rumors of Catalent buyout sent the expectation to almost 20x EBITDA. Pantheon and Cook Pharma were both acquired for around 17 times EBITDA. If you apply a more conservative 15x multiple and subtract net debt, you are looking at a $14-15 stock. Apply 20x and you have a $20 stock.  What I see is a catalyst rich stock with next earnings right around the corner trading far below any reasonable transaction price (note: given that they released their Q2 only a couple of weeks ago Q3 could be delayed by few weeks). Should going concern be resolved by then, I believe people will begin speculating on potential buyout and shorts would be in deep trouble. Why would you be short should lenders agree to forbearance and acquirer could multiples of current price?  Would appreciate any feedback you have. I‚Äôm long LFCR but if there‚Äôs anything I‚Äôm missing happy to know about it.,;,; 2023-04-20 20:21:46]
[TSLA for Long Term,;,; Hey fellow Redditors!   I‚Äôm curious to hear your thoughts on Tesla and whether you‚Äôre feeling bullish about its long-term potential.

However, concerns about competition and market dynamics also exist.   What‚Äôs your take on TSLA‚Äôs future?,;,; 2024-01-25 21:07:15]
[Puts on TSLA?,;,; I've been following Tesla for a while, and to me personally the fundamentals don't make sense. I am also concerned about Elon Musk's other business endeavors distracting him from the business   ( Twitter, SpaceX, Starlink, Etc.). Their margins are shrinking, interest rates are high, competitors are gaining market share, and the Cybertruck was arguably a miss ( I haven't ever seen one in person, and Rivian stock gained 7% the day it was released), all of that being also under the pressure of the growing used EV market. I believe in the very long term it could pan out, I have a few shares of TSLQ (inverse TSLA) but am looking to buy more/ buy puts. What do you think?,;,; 2024-01-08 23:15:39]

[We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),;,; \*\* I have no position that is impacted by this post\*\*  Over the past few years, TSLA has performed nothing short of extraordinary. In the last five years, Tesla stock has almost 10x its value. The 857% total return of Tesla is substantially higher than all of its peers, including Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen  Despite strong growth, weakness has begun to present itself within the Wall Street prince in the past year. Tesla announced earlier in February 2023 that it would be cutting prices on the Model Y. This move surprised investors because, before the price cuts, Tesla appeared to be entirely supply-side constrained. However, investors noted that these cuts only impacted higher-end models that were outside the range of the mass vehicle market. However, in April, Tesla announced that it would be cutting prices on the Model 3. Elon Musk has previously alluded to a poor performing EV market in the wake of a higher interest rate environment. Economic data confirms this narrative as Automobile shipments have declined substantially in Q3‚Äô 2023.  However, two factors that cannot be explained by an adverse economic environment are Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Cybertruck demand. FSD is Tesla‚Äôs end-to-end autonomous driving solution.  Tesla‚Äôs FSD is considered a level 2 autonomous driving solution. Level 2 systems require the driver to remain alert at all times with the anticipation that driver will have to take over in every circumstance. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed that FSD would be finished by the end of the year for the past six years. Additionally, Musk has claimed that robo-taxis, completely automated taxi services would be available during the same timeframes. Tesla‚Äôs current FSD beta boasts some impressive technologies, including the ability to navigate through city streets without immediate intervention in many cases. However, level 3 seems to be uncertain  for the car company. On the other hand, Tesla‚Äôs competitors such as Waymo, Mobileye, and Cruise have all operated in some capacity at level 3 or level 4. In particular, Mobileye has proved to be a serious threat to FSD due to its goal of integrating in Tesla‚Äôs competitors. Mobileye has outlined several technologies that are set to compete with Tesla‚Äôs current offerings as well as Tesla‚Äôs future capabilities.  The Cybertruck further highlights Tesla‚Äôs habit of misleading shareholders. The Cybertruck is Tesla‚Äôs consumer pickup truck expected to be launched in Q4 2023. In Tesla‚Äôs Q2 2023 earnings call, Musk stated that Cybertruck demand is, "so off the hook, you can‚Äôt even see the hook.‚Äù EV insider reported that this statement was likely to transfer into 1.9 million preorders. However, Tesla failed to mention that the Cybertruck‚Äôs preorder deposit was $100. In Tesla‚Äôs Q3 earnings call, Musk stated that ‚ÄúWe dug our own grave‚Äù when referring to Cybertruck. He noted that he expects it to be 18 months before Cybertruck is cash flow positive, adding another timeline onto a timeline full of delays. Musk still sees demand surpassing one million units. However, it seems unlikely that demand will be that high, considering high interest rate environment and mere $100 commitment by prospective buyers.,;,; 2023-10-29 14:59:47]

[Tesla Crushes Delivery Expectations, $TSLA Deliveries Soar 83% Year-Over-Year:,;,; Tesla's success is attributed to robust demand and efficiency in production.        Tesla (TSLA) reported delivery numbers for the second quarter of 2023 that beat analysts' expectations. The company delivered 466,140 vehicles in the quarter, up 83% year-over-year. Tesla also produced 479,700 vehicles in the quarter, up 71% year-over-year.        The strong delivery numbers were driven by strong demand for Tesla's vehicles. The company also added more manufacturing capacity in the quarter, including its new assembly plant in Austin, Texas.        Thanks to competitive pricing and factory production, Tesla looks set to hit a delivery goal of 1.8 million vehicles this year.        On July 19, Tesla will report its earnings.,;,; 2023-07-03 12:53:35]
[TSLA plant in Monterrey, Mexico confirmed,;,; Rumors have been circulating for at least a couple months, but confirmed now by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador: Tesla is set to build a brand new plant in Monterrey, Mexico. This is a huge boost for Mexico, as it's trying to establish itself as a hub for investment by bringing manufacturing capacity to North America and away from Asia, thanks to geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Lopez Obrador revealed that he had a call with Elon Musk on Monday, and they came to an agreement that will create lots of jobs and bring in a considerable investment. The President had previously expressed concerns over water shortages, but Musk was receptive and has accepted Mexico's proposals.  This investment is a big test for Mexico's President, who has a reputation for being a bit of a resource nationalist. Some companies have been unsettled by his efforts to strengthen state control of the energy market at the expense of private capital. But with Mexico receiving its highest foreign direct investment inflows for years in 2022, it's clear that the country's lower-cost and skilled workforce is making it a global center for the car industry.  We don't know all the details just yet, but Lopez Obrador said Tesla will likely give us more information tomorrow. It's all happening during Musk's "Investor Day," where he'll outline his "Master Plan Part Three."  (source: [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mexican-president-says-tesla-build-143052963.html))  Not sure whether to buy calls or puts on Musk? Here's a strategy so you don't have to be married to one direction. With this ratio spread you can make up to 14% (20% annualized) AND still be protected if TSLA dips.

[TSLA claims "We're in-between growth waves", stock up 6%,;,; I know tesla stock is a beat to death subject. But I can't get over how crazy the stock is. You got Elon crying on earnings call, stock plunges. Now it's hyping up again. I'm short TSLA and I think that's the for sure easiest money play you could make right now. But how is easing inflation hyping up the price, despite all the headwinds they have? Priced like a growth stock but no longer growing. In fact massively sinking margins. They even admit this today saying they are "in-between growth waves". What does that mean. When will the next mega growth wave be that justifies the insane market cap?

[What would need to happen for TSLA to *not* be overvalued today?,;,; Currently TSLA is trading close to $265/share, or about an $880B market cap.  It's a reasonable argument that if an asset can beat the S&amp;P 500 CAGR, then it's a good investment. Given that the S&amp;P typically provides a 5% CAGR, let's see what would be needed for Tesla to achieve a 10% CAGR by, let's say.. end of 2030.  $880B \* 1.10\^7 = $1.71T market cap, or about $512/share  So how does Tesla make it to a $1.7T market cap in 2030? I'm going to assume a 30 P/E, which everyone will bitch and complain about beause they hate Tesla, but I think there's reasonable arguments for and against 30. The "for" argument being that I believe they'll still be growing EV sales and energy storage products. If a 30 P/E, then Tesla needs:  $1710B / 30 = $57B in gaap earnings  So how much gaap earnings does Tesla make per EV sold? I'll link to a graph of the "TTM avg gaap earnings per EV sold" in the comments  Tesla's current earnings profitability is about $5,600 per EV sold, and it continues to go up over the long term, even if rates have caused a recent drop (earnings per EV maxed out at $10.3k in q1 2022). Let's just assume a long term profitability of $5,700 per EV (super conservative imo). Tesla will need to sell about  $57B earnings / $5,700 earnings per EV = 10M EVs annually  Conclusion: If Tesla sells 10M EVs in 2030, then it is not overvalued today, in fact.. it beats the S&amp;P. This isn't even including profits from the energy storage sector of the business, or the wildcards of robotaxis and bots.,;,; 2023-09-19 19:11:24]

Tesla focuses on being the best at what they do and currently has the best assembly line process. Other car companies are trying to copy Tesla. Eventually, all other services will come to fruition, i.e. FSD, Robotaxis, Robots.  As a side note, Elon mentioned in public that he thought Tesla was a 3 to 4 trillion dollar company.

I used the profits to pay taxes, go on a backpacking trip, close the margin account, and become totally debt free (aside from the mortgage.)   Honestly it improved my life significantly.   Still, now seeing it rise higher and higher, I‚Äôve got FOMO and want to take another margin loan to jump back in for more profits.

[Should I sell $RIVN before $TSLA earnings call?,;,; Tesla‚Äôs next earnings report is slated for July 19th with an estimated 46% earnings increase in their share price. What I‚Äôm unsure of is If I should sell my stock in $RIVN before this happens?   The reason I say this is because I feel this would shift much of the recent attention on Rivian back to Tesla if their stock earnings are good as everyone is hoping to see them hit $300 a share.  I feel conflicted because Rivian seems like a promising stock to hold as they are finally starting to get a foothold on the market and turn a profit, plus their truck deal with Amazon. I understand that no one can predict the future of a stock but I‚Äôm wondering what the general consensus on this Subreddit is.

[Help me with the math on TSLA supercharging,;,; Lots of hype lately about the NACS plug standard adoption. Yes, it‚Äôs a good thing to have one type of plug across most/all cars.  Yes, it will potentially generate more revenue for Tesla by increasing demand at super charger stations.  However, I am seeing incredibly high $billion dollar revenue numbers getting thrown around like candy.  Knowing the realization of this NACS adoption is years away and that Tesla has something like 17000 stations in the USA, let‚Äôs do some math:  Assuming each charger is active everyday for 1 year and they are fully utilized at 24 times per day. At their charge rate I was told by others that each charge generates about $25 per.  I think I am being very optimistic and conservative.    So, I get to about $3.7/3.8B per year in Revenue (not earnings).   If Tesla in 5 years doubled that 17000 in US then of course double that revenue number.    Again, lots of assumptions and fairly optimistic and conservative.    Where do all these so called expert analysts get their wild revenue numbers?   I have seen $10B plus in revenue by 2030 and $100B plus by xxxx.  Are they assuming that the rest of the world will also use Tesla super chargers at this same rate?   Tesla will have no competition for charging?   That EVs will dominate the car industry in next 5-10 years?   Etc.  OK, let‚Äôs throw in all 40000 chargers world wide and using same estimates we are $8.8B per year.  Again, huge assumptions into the far off future.    Aren‚Äôt the Tesla market cap increases after all these announcements ridiculous?  Are analysts intentionally misleading investors with their unrealistic expectations for the next 5-10 years?  Are investors blinded by the momentum trade?   Is this another meme moment?    What am I missing?,;,; 2023-06-21 10:56:13]

[Morgan Stanley Sees Dojo Boosting TSLA Value by $500 Billion,;,; Headline comes from Bloomberg [(yahoo link)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-surge-thanks-dojo-supercomputer-032644640.html)  TSLA is up nearly 10% today.  Morgan Stanley's upgrade of TSLA was a target of $400, up from $250.  Excerpt from the article:  &gt; Tesla has been mentioning how Dojo gives it an edge in AI and self-driving technology since at least 2021. In July this year, CEO Elon Musk told investors that the carmaker plans to invest more than $1 billion on the project by the end of 2024.  &gt; ‚ÄúAs a point of reference, in 2022, Nvidia spent $7 billion across the entire company on research and development,‚Äù Gene Munster, co-founder and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, wrote in a note in July. ‚ÄúIn other words, spending $1 billion plus on a single product is aggressive and speaks to Musk‚Äôs urgency at making good on this FSD prediction.‚Äù  &gt; Seth Goldstein of Morningstar Research Services LLC says that, ‚Äúwhile it‚Äôs good for Elon to push the team to go as quickly as possible, in reality Tesla usually sees a delay from Elon‚Äôs original timelines.‚Äù  &gt; ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt making progress,‚Äù Goldstein said in a phone interview Monday. ‚ÄúOnce Dojo is up and running and takes over the software training, it will allow Tesla to update software more quickly and increase subscriptions at software margins, which can be a big value driver.‚Äù,;,; 2023-09-11 18:14:43]

[Tesla's earnings should improve in Q4; short TSLA puts now for income.,;,; In Q3, Tesla reported modest results with a 5% YoY increase in automotive revenue and a 9% YoY increase in total revenue, attributed to price decreases, lower sales volume, and production. Despite this, the company generated positive free cash flow (FCF) of $0.8 billion, with a 3.4% FCF margin.        Analysts are more optimistic about Q4, forecasting a 10.6% potential gain in adjusted non-GAAP EPS to 73 cents and a 9.5% increase in total revenue to $25.7 billion. However, Tesla's stock (TSLA) has seen a decline, down 8.1% in the last month and 20.1% from its peak in July, possibly reflecting pessimism.        Option premiums are high due to this pessimism, providing an opportunity for investors to sell short near-term out-of-the-money (OTM) puts as an income play. For instance, by selling the $220 strike price expiring on Dec. 8 for $4.35, investors can achieve an immediate 1.98% yield for three weeks.        Investors must secure $22,000 in cash or margin to sell 1 put contract, potentially making $7,395 annually if the trade is repeated every three weeks. However, this strategy carries risks, as TSLA could drop below the breakeven level, requiring the investor to purchase 100 shares at the strike price.        To manage downside risk, investors can buy puts at a lower OTM strike price, such as the $210 puts, reducing potential losses. Alternatively, a very conservative approach involves shorting the $210 puts for immediate income and a lower breakeven level.        Investors should carefully monitor market conditions and adjust their strategy accordingly, potentially selling $210 puts for income once it appears unlikely that TSLA will fall near that price within the next three weeks.    ,;,; 2023-11-20 10:53:46]
[Why Tesla ($TSLA) stock has tanked over the past 5 days,;,;    Tesla stock ($TSLA) has gone downhill in the wake of a shaky earnings release last week.  The EV player has seen its stock tank about 18% to $154 since its first-quarter earnings release on April 19.  The share price slide has wiped out about $87 billion in market capitalization for Tesla. Tesla's market has dipped below the $500 billion mark, currently resting at $487 billion.Year to date, Tesla's stock is still up 24%, compared to a 5.6% advance for the S&amp;P 500.Investors are probably locking in on several issues that have swirled around Tesla in recent days.  The initial is a bad first-quarter gross profit margin miss. Wall Street pinned the blame on Tesla's steady drumbeat of price cuts in the quarter.  "Let's call it like it is: Tesla delivered mixed results with solid demand metrics, but the elephant in the room is softer margins," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients.  CEO Elon Musk did little to stem margin concerns on the earnings call. Musk and his CFO, Zach Kirkhorn, leaned into a philosophy of wanting to move more EVs, even if that means cutting prices further and pressuring margins.  Wall Street was having none of it, coming out with cautious takes and downwardly revised profit estimates.  "Although both technology and execution risk seem substantially less than was once feared, expansion into higher volume segments with lower price points seems fraught with greater risk relative to demand, execution, and competition," JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a client note.  Brinkman reiterated an Underweight rating on Tesla's stock (sell equivalent).  The Detroit-based auto giant touted market share gains in EVs. It also detailed plans to double EV production in the second half of this year as it eyes taking away more of Tesla's dominance.,;,; 2023-04-28 08:55:13]
[What happened to $TSLA this week?,;,; Welcome my weekly $TSLA update.                **1) Volkswagen confirms talks with Tesla over NACS charging standard.**        Volkswagen is considering using Tesla's charging connector for its electric vehicles in North America, potentially joining Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS). The company is currently in talks with Tesla about adopting this connector for its Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, and future Scout brands in the region.        **2) Tesla set for record quarter in China.**        Analysts predict that Tesla is likely to achieve a new sales record in China despite competition from local rivals. Estimates suggest Tesla could sell around 155,000 cars in China from April to June, marking a 13% increase from the previous quarter, although its market share may decline slightly due to increased competition from companies like BYD and Aion.        **3) Tesla sales forecast for Q2: 440,000-450,000 deliveries.**        As the second quarter comes to a close, Tesla remains the dominant force in the electric vehicle market, with estimated sales forecasts for Q2 ranging from 441,000 to 448,000 vehicles. The Model Y is expected to outpace other models, and while Tesla's production is increasing, concerns arise regarding the gap between production and deliveries. The upcoming release of the Cybertruck and a lower-cost Tesla model are seen as crucial for sustaining Tesla's growth.        **4) Elon vs. Zuck: it's officially happening.**        Tech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have engaged in social media banter about a potential cage fight between them, generating publicity and attention. However, it remains uncertain whether the fight will actually take place, and some speculate that the discussion may serve as a distraction from recent negative news surrounding Meta's decision to cut off news access in Canada and Musk's declining reputation--according to data from Morning Consult.                **PS:** links + update in your inbox every week, [here](https://teslafolder.beehiiv.com/).,;,; 2023-06-29 22:23:03]

[Anyone get frustration with themselves not buy more Magnificent 7 ?,;,; In early 2023, I noticed that these Magnificent 7 should be in my portfolio, which I did get into Meta, NVDA, GOOD, and TSLA.

However, I managed to hold my NVDA, which was up so much, but eventually, I sold it at $425 in August.

[Tesla stock ($TSLA) sinks as Barclays says it's time 'to move to the sidelines'.,;,; Tesla ($TSLA) stock sank 5.5% on Wednesday, its steepest loss in two months, after one analyst on Wall Street cautioned it was time to take some money off the table.        In a note to investors on Wednesday, Barclays analyst Dan Levy downgraded Tesla shares to Equal Weight from Overweight, claiming the recent rally ignored near-term questions about the stock‚Äôs fundamentals. Though Tesla doesn‚Äôt exactly trade on fundamentals ‚Äî it currently trades at a forward P/E of 80 ‚Äî Levy does make some interesting points about where Tesla stock sits compared to only a month ago.        ‚ÄúWe believe the stock‚Äôs recent rally can be best explained by the market‚Äôs current AI-driven thematic trade, as well as excitement over recent announcements to open the TSLA Supercharger network to other brands,‚Äù Levy said in his note. ‚ÄúYet while we aren‚Äôt surprised that the stock has participated in the rally, we believe it is prudent to move to the sidelines.‚Äù  Levy‚Äôs main thesis for the downgrade rests on three main points: the AI effect that may be overblown, Tesla‚Äôs recent Supercharger deals and uncertain benefits, and, most importantly, how multiple expansion is really the ‚Äúentirety of the rally.‚Äù        As for AI, the recent run-up in Nvidia and other AI-related stocks that looped in Tesla made sense because of the company‚Äôs ventures like FSD (full self-driving), its Dojo supercomputer, and the Optimus robot (though somewhat ironically CEO Elon Musk has warned about the dangers of AI). Levy however believes AI is a ‚Äúlong-dated‚Äù opportunity for Tesla, not something that can be counted on right now to considerably boost its valuation.  Similarly, Tesla‚Äôs charging deals with Ford, GM, and Rivian are seen more as creating ‚Äúmarketing benefits‚Äù for Tesla, with any gains again probably coming in the long term, Levy says.        The biggest factor for the \~$300 billion run-up in Tesla stock has been its expanding multiple, Levy said. Tesla‚Äôs near-term fundamentals haven‚Äôt changed, and while other AI-related stocks have seen positive profit revisions that led to market cap increases, this isn‚Äôt the case for Tesla.        Levy believes a number of factors fly in the face of that ballooning multiple, including that Barclays believes Tesla‚Äôs 2024 consensus EPS estimates are still too rosy and need to be brought down. In addition, Tesla‚Äôs margins are still ‚Äúuncertain‚Äù given recent price cuts, though it is possible margins may have troughed. Finally, more price cuts may be necessary as Model 3 inventories look bloated, and increased Model Y production in Giga Austin and Berlin may necessitate further price reductions, again hurting margins.        All that being said, Levy is still long-term bullish on Tesla‚Äôs prospects, just not a buyer at these levels. ‚ÄúWe continue to see TSLA as the long-term winner amongst OEMs in the race to an EV world,‚Äù Levy says, but ‚Äúnear term fundamentals need to be considered.‚Äù,;,; 2023-06-22 06:21:56]
["Magnificent 7" vs S&amp;P 500?,;,; I really don't like the *"Magnificent 7"* name at all, but since everyone has adopted it, let's just roll with it. For those who don't know the Magnificent 7 are: **AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META, TSLA, NVDA.** With a combined market cap of **more than $11 trillion**, they currently make up approx. **29% of the S&amp;P 500's market cap.**   The 7 giants have gained **71%** so far this year while the rest of the 493 stocks included in the benchmark index have gained 6%. They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets.   Most analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least.   Now I know this is a "stocks" subreddit but just like the majority of retail investors, a large chunk of my portfolio is alocated to an S&amp;P 500 ETF.  So I am actually considering instead of DCAing into a broad index ETF, why don't I just DCA into those 7? Maybe even swap META &amp; TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE.  Should we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world? Should we consider cyclicality? There's no doubt that all 7 of these companies are leaders and are probably not going anywhere in the near future.

[Which company are you willing to buy its shares but never their products/services?,;,; I am curious if you all have such cases. I've learned over the years that it's easier to invest in companies whose products/services I use but it's not really the best strategy as personal biases apply (ex: I use ASOS a lot for my clothes but their share has been getting hammered since the post-pandemic peak).  So, I've decided to actually search for solid companies to buy, even if I don't buy their products. Two quick examples of mine:  1. AAPL: Probably the most well-run company in recent years. I never owned a single Apple product, as I've always considered them overpriced and my stubborn-ass being fixated on android phones and microsoft products. But I cannot dispute how well the company is ran and able to secure a loyal customer line and solid profit margins year after year.  2. TSLA: Personally, I don't ever plan on buying a Tesla car and I also don't really like Elon as a person. But I still have to acknowledge some of the advantages that Tesla has as a company, especially their data collecting systems. I think Tesla has a great future and even if I'm not a fan of Elon, I can still put my biases aside and realize that there's ton of experienced investors who trust him. He has a great track record of building companies so that's a risk I'm willing to take (TSLA is like 3-4% of my portfolio)  Do you have any similar examples?,;,; 2023-05-29 14:12:18]

[Tesla Stock booms with $32,000 starting price for model 3 after tax credit,;,; All of the Tesla (TSLA) Model 3 vehicle trims are now eligible for the full tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Internal Revenue Service verified Tuesday. While it remains unclear how the global EV giant accomplished the feat, the Model 3 now has a starting price of around $32,000. TSLA stock jumped Wednesday.  **Tesla stock advanced 1.6% to 224.83 Wednesday during market trade with Tesla Model 3 vehicles going for as low as $30,330 on the company's website.**   Tesla is officially saying the Model 3 starts at $32,740 after the $7,500 IRA tax credit. Meanwhile, reports circulated early Wednesday that Tesla has agreed in principle with a plan to set up a manufacturing plant in India. Tesla's website recently stated that the base Model 3 vehicle was eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit under the IRA. The model previously only qualified at the $3,750 level. Tesla has not disclosed how it brought the Model 3 into alignment with IRA requirements for the full tax credit. Meanwhile, the IRS made the official change to its site Tuesday morning. It announced all Model 3 and Model Y vehicles qualify for the $7,500 tax credit.  # Model 3 Tax Credit Doubles  The Biden administration said on March 31 that vehicles eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit must have batteries with specific quantities of components manufactured in North America and critical minerals sourced in the U.S. or from certain countries.  Vehicles that meet only one of the critical minerals or battery components requirements are eligible for a $3,750 tax credit. At the time, the base rear-wheel-drive Model 3, with its battery from China, did not qualify for the full tax credit.   **Tesla stock shrugged off early losses and climbed 1.7% to 221.31 Tuesday. It turned higher just after the IRS confirmed the Model 3 eligibility. TSLA has gained in the past seven sessions. It has gained 117% since early January lows of 101.81.**  # The Eligibility Switch  Late Monday, Morgan Stanley Adam Jonas wrote the qualification change "implies that Tesla likely tweaked its supply chain to meet both requirements.  "Tesla has used lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from China's CATL for the base Model 3. CATL commented Monday that rumors Tesla has ended their relationship are untrue and there is no change in the strategic partnership.   Jonas told investors Tesla may have switched to manufacturing Model 3 battery packs in the U.S. while still using China-made battery cells. The analysts also floated the idea that, with Shanghai Tesla exporting to Canada, it could be freeing up U.S. battery production for local deliveries.   Or, Jonas said, it simply could be "regulatory semantics." Under guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury, EV manufacturers can average the qualifying critical mineral content used over a limited period of time. Jonas said this language means Tesla could produce enough qualifying Model 3 batteries at its Fremont plant to offset the Model 3 rear-wheel drive trim's China-made battery.,;,; 2023-06-08 07:22:29]

[Tesla stock closes below $200, hits 5-month low as a tough October rolls on,;,; Despite a larger market gain, Tesla (TSLA) shares fell 4.8% on Monday, going below $200 and reaching its lowest level since late May. The drop was caused by two major factors:        **1.** Tesla's battery supplier, Panasonic, cut vehicle battery output in Japan during the third quarter, decreasing its annual profit prediction by 15%. This was attributable to a worldwide slowdown in EV sales. Panasonic provides battery cells to Tesla's Nevada Gigafactory in the United States. However, the Japanese manufacturing drop had an impact on customers worldwide, not only in North America.        **2.** ON Semiconductor revealed lower-than-expected profit and revenue guidance due to decreasing sales. ON Semiconductor manufactures silicon carbide chips used by Tesla in its EV powertrain and other important components. A decline in demand for these chips is viewed as a possible indicator of slowing EV sales, notably for Tesla.        Tesla investor Gary Black said that the stock's downturn could be attributed to ON Semiconductor's -18% projection failure. This was owing to concerns about the increasing danger to vehicle demand caused by rising interest rates.        Tesla shares have dropped roughly 22% in the last month, but are still **up 60% year to date.**        ,;,; 2023-10-31 10:56:43]

Amazon will be doing ~$550B in revenue in 2023 alone with low teen growth next year. And their market cap is between $1T-$1.1T.

[Selling Covered Calls,;,; So a little background, I (41m) make a decent salary for where I live, but I can get pretty busy at work, not to mention I would be away from my computer/cell phone due to meetings, so it would be impossible for me to trade/look at stocks at particular times during the day. After years of frustration, I have finally try selling cover calls.   * I aim for volatile large cap stocks so the I can gain more premium with each option sold.  * For the month of March, I focused on TSLA.   * I don't sell naked calls. * I only sell weekly calls. * I roll it on Friday, normally 15 minutes before the market closes. * I bought 100 of TSLA on 3/9 and let it be called out (sold) on 3/31/2023.  Here are the results:  * 03/09 \~ 03/31: bought 100 shares at $184.5, strike out at $207.5, profit +$2300  * On 3/09, sold 3/17 call, strike price $180: Sold for $920,  buy back for $60, profit +$860 * On 3/17, sold 3/24 call, strike price $180: Sold for $580, buy back for¬†$813. lost¬†-$233 * On 3/24, sold 3/31 call, strike price $180: Sold for $1142, buy back for $2075, lost -$933   * Total profit: $1994  Now, if I didn't sell those covered calls (instead of just holding the stock), I would have made $2300 instead (of $1994). However, the very next week the stock price of TSLA went from around $207.5 to $185. So, if I would have just rolled that last week (3/31) I would have retained all my profit (sold maybe for around $2090, buy back around $500), versus holding the stock and have all the profit gone in a week. That is the attractive part about selling calls, is that you always collect a premium each week regardless the price of the stock.  So I do a few questions, maybe the community can help. Where can I learn more about selling calls? The articles I found online only covers the very basic concepts of it, and I would like to have a more in-depth perspective of this, for example; how to select the strike price, expiration date, when to roll, stock selects, etc. Thanks.,;,; 2023-04-16 15:40:18]

[Unusual options activity in Tesla stock shows a large investor taking a position,;,; Two large tranches of Tesla (TSLA) stock options were traded on May 30: one a near-term in-the-money put position and the other a long-term way out-of-the-money call option. This unusual stock options activity is likely from a large investor.  The Unusual Stock Options Activity on May 30 showed that there were 13,039 put options traded at the $202.50 strike price for expiration on June 2, this Friday. The second tranche was for 13,064 call options traded at the $310 strike price for expiration on Oct. 20, 2023, 142 days from now.  **Large Calls And Puts In TSLA Stock**  The first tranche of options (puts) was in-the-money since the price of TSLA stock closed at $201.16 on Tuesday, May 16. The second tranche was way out-of-the-money (OTM) since the $310 call strike price is 54% higher than today's price.   But interestingly, both had very similar prices. That's what makes me believe that both tranches were likely initiated together. For example, the puts closed at $5.45 per put contract, and the calls traded at $5.15 per call contract.  That implies that the investor may have gone long the puts and paid the $5.45 price, even though they only have $1.34 of intrinsic value (i.e., $202.50-201.16=$1.34). The reason is that they shorted the OTM calls and received $5.15 per call contract. That leaves a net cost of just 30 cents (i.e., $5.45-$5.15).         So, in effect, the short-put investor has a profit of $1.04 in the long puts, as long as TSLA stock stays at $201.16 or lower. Meanwhile, they must figure the call options will wither over time unless TSLA stock rises by over 54% over the next 142 days (almost 4.75 months from now).  **Where TSLA Stock Stands Now**  Tesla stock is up over 22% so far in May and has risen 63.3% so far in 2023 since it closed at $123.18 at the end of 2022. Moreover, the company reported on April 19 that Q1 revenue rose 24% YoY compared to last year, although non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) fell 22%.         However, analysts expect EPS to rise to $3.50 per share this year and $5.03 next year, up 43.7% by the end of 2024. This puts TSLA stock on a forward multiple of 40x for 2024, which is not that expensive.         So, theoretically, TSLA stock could rise 54% by Oct 20, especially since by then analysts would have received the Q3 earnings report for the quarter ending Sept. 30. Nevertheless, that could be a reach. In other words, it's possible that the call options could potentially be worth $5.15 by Oct. 20.        Nevertheless, there is a good possibility that TSLA might not be seen as undervalued given how far it has risen this year. That is likely what the investor who likely shorted these deep OTM calls is counting on.        It also shows that the investor is likely more bearish on TSLA stock as they have, in effect, a large in-the-money put position that is mostly paid for by shorting the OTM calls. So investors who intend to copy these moves should be careful.    **Another Interpretation**  Also, keep in mind that my interpretation of these tranches may not be correct. It is possible the investor went long on these OTM $310 strike price calls. They may have shorted the in-the-money puts with the hope that TSLA stock will rise in the next 2 days. That is they shorted the $202.50 puts, received $5.45 per contract, and turned around and used those proceeds to purchase the $310 strike price calls, paying $5.15 per contract for them.        At least that way the long call position is more than paid for, with a net 30-cent credit (i.e., $5.45 from the short puts - $5.15 for the long OTM calls). And even if the $202.50 strike price puts are exercised, at least then the investor will own the TSLA shares at $202.50 (less 30 cents net credit). So then they will have a covered call position with the $310 OTM calls.        Either way, you can see that a large investor has taken a big position in TSLA stock which is mostly bullish. You can decide if you want to copy them.,;,; 2023-06-01 10:32:55]
[What Am I Missing?,;,; Edit: People seem to have a TSLA fixation and think I want to buy it. That's not the case. I don't care what your opinion of TSLA is. I've done my analysis of all the stocks mentioned below according to the analysis mentioned below. Tell me where my analysis falls short and what other methods I should consider (that don't involve technical analysis).   Seeing some recent rave reviews about TSLA, ADBE, and FDX lately. Talking about the charging method Tesla uses becoming the standard in North America and being adopted by SAE, Adobe's investments in generative AI, and Fedex being able to pick up some slack if UPS workers go on strike, as well as some other investments and innovations they've been making.  But the problem is, I just don't see them valued at good prices.   FDX is trading at almost 2.5x book and 21x earnings  ADBE is trading at 15x book, almost 47x earnings, and 12x revenue per share  TSLA is trading at almost 17x book, almost 74x earnings, and over 9x revenue per share.  From a valuation standpoint (P/B, P/E, and P/S), those numbers are completely unjustifiable when considering buying.  So is there something I'm missing? Something I'm failing to consider? It seems like in the case of TSLA and ADBE their tech advancements could be a competitive advantage. Or are these types of stocks just wildly overhyped and overpriced? Because from a valuation perspective (P/B, P/E, and P/S) things like DINO, PBR, TSN, NTR, X, HMC, WFG, BIO, and BNTX look like great buys - why wouldn't I just buy those. They seem much more fairly priced, even cheap...  So what am I missing? What else do I need to consider in my analysis, if anything?,;,; 2023-06-29 03:53:26]

Automotive revenue, Tesla‚Äôs core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.  Tesla‚Äôs first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.  The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night.

Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.  Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.   Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management‚Äôs consideration were seeking updates on the company‚Äôs trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company‚Äôs energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.  In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.  A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day‚Äôs drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.  According to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.  Tesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023.

[Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..),;,; From https://www.investors.com/news/nasdaq-100-plans-special-rebalance-to-curb-dominance-of-magnificent-seven/    The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the "magnificent seven" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.  The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.  The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to "address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights."  The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.  The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.   How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted? The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.  The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.  The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.  Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.  Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.  Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.  Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.  Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.  How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut? Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.  Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.  The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.  Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023 The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.  This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.  There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.  Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices? The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.  However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&amp;P 500, which is why S&amp;P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.  The S&amp;P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.  Most of the "magnificent 7" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.  The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.  Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.,;,; 2023-07-10 20:25:37]
[Meta Q4 Earnings Numbers,;,; Earnings: $5.33 per share. That may not compare with the $4.96 per share expected by LSEG  Revenue: $40.1 billion. That may not compare with the $39.18 billion expected by LSEG   Wall Street will also be looking at these key user numbers:  Daily active users (DAUs): 2.11 billion vs. 2.08 billion expected, according to StreetAccount  Monthly active users (MAUs): 3.07 billion vs. 3.06 billion expected, according to StreetAccount   Meta is projected to report revenue growth of 22% as the online advertising market continues to recover from a brutal 2022, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates forced brands to reel in spending.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributes advances in artificial intelligence to improvements in the ad business, which is growing faster than rival Google. In Alphabet‚Äôs earnings report on Tuesday, the company said Google ad revenue increased 11% from a year earlier, slower expansion than analysts were expecting.  Part of Meta‚Äôs financial recovery over the past year was driven by Chinese retailers, which have bolstered spending to reach users across the globe. Meta finance chief Susan Li most recently highlighted the significance of business from China in the company‚Äôs third-quarter earnings report in October. Li didn‚Äôt name specific companies, but fast-growing upstarts Temu and Shein, which originated in China, have been pouring money into ads on Facebook and Instagram.  While Meta has a very diverse base of advertisers, some analysts say the potential for Temu and Shein to pull back spending poses a risk because every point of growth matters for a company that saw revenue shrink for three straight quarters in 2022.  Zuckerberg, along with the top executives at TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Snap and Discord, faced tough questioning from lawmakers on Wednesday. They accused the Facebook founder of ignoring the severity of child exploitation on the company‚Äôs family of apps.  Parents attending the hearing lambasted Meta and other companies for what they allege are insufficient safety and design measures that have caused mental health issues for their children and, in some cases, even resulted in their deaths.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for everything you‚Äôve all gone through. It‚Äôs terrible,‚Äù Zuckerberg told the parents in an emotional scene on Capitol Hill. ‚ÄúNo one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.‚Äù   Investors will also be looking for signs that Meta‚Äôs pivot to the metaverse is bearing fruit. The company has been burning billions of dollars a quarter to build out a virtual world that Zuckerberg has said is the future of computing. In total, the division has lost about $25 billion since the beginning of 2022, shortly after Zuckerberg renamed his company.  Analysts expect Reality Labs to show revenue of $762.8 million for the quarter and an operating loss of $4.26 billion, according to StreetAccount.

[Tesla stock falls more than 5% after hours as Investor Day falls short on detail,;,; https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/01/tesla-2023-investor-day-after-the-bell-master-plan-part-3-teased.html  Electric vehicle maker Tesla hosted a 2023 Investor Day presentation in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday. CEO Elon Musk took the stage to share his ‚ÄúMaster Plan 3,‚Äù and to discuss how Tesla plans to scale up in the face of increasing competition.  The presentation was long on vision, and included a review of prior achievements, but short on specifics about any new Tesla products or services.  Near the beginning of the presentation, Musk said, ‚ÄúThere is a clear path to a sustainable-energy Earth. It doesn‚Äôt require destroying natural habitats. It doesn‚Äôt require us to be austere and stop using electricity and be in the cold or anything.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúIn fact, you could support a civilization much bigger than Earth, much more than the 8 billion humans could actually be supported sustainably on Earth.‚Äù  Musk was initially joined on stage by the Senior Vice President of Powertrain and Energy Engineering at Tesla, Drew Baglino. They discussed a future in which the company would play a role in ‚Äúre-powering the grid with renewable fuels‚Äù as they ramp up battery production, both for Tesla‚Äôs electric vehicles and for the company‚Äôs utility-scale energy storage systems.  Tesla‚Äôs goal is to produce 20 million electric vehicles per year by 2030, executives reiterated. The company reported full-year deliveries of around 1.31 million vehicles in 2022.  During a question and answer session following the 3-hour presentation, executives fielded a question about how Tesla could grow its market share in China.  Elon Musk passed the question to Tom Zhu, who is heading up global production and has run the China and APAC businesses for Tesla for years. ‚ÄúAs long as you offer a product with value at affordable price you don‚Äôt have to worry about demand,‚Äù Zhu said. ‚ÄúWe try everything to cut costs,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúand pass down that value to our customers.‚Äù  Musk then added, ‚ÄúDemand is a function of affordability not desire.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúEven small changes in the price have a big effect on demand.‚Äù  Zhu also announced that as of Wednesday, Tesla had produced 4 million cars in total.  ‚ÄúIt took us 12 years to build the first million, and about 18 months to the second million. The third million, 11 months. Then less than 7 months to build the 4 millionth,‚Äù Zhu said touting the company‚Äôs improving operational efficiency.  He said that the company plans to build new car and battery cell factories, and also to produce more cars per year at its existing factories.  Tesla charging leader Rebecca Tinucci said that in 2022 the company provided 9 terawatt hours across charging methods, including home charging including 40,000 Superchargers. (By way of comparison, the entire U.S. consumes about 4,000 terawatt hours of electricity per year.) Tinucci also noted that about half of the company‚Äôs Superchargers in the EU are open to other vehicles, and that the company just opened 10 Superchargers in the US to non-Teslas.  Tesla design leader Franz von Holzhausen and vice president of vehicle engineering Lars Moravy took the stage to show off a number of planned manufacturing changes meant to improve the efficiency of Tesla vehicle production. But von Holzhausen said that Tesla would not yet reveal its ‚Äúnext gen‚Äù vehicle.  The company‚Äôs powertrain vice president, Colin Campbell, said that Tesla‚Äôs next powertrain factory will be 50% smaller than the one in Austin, Texas, but will have the same capacity. He also said the company is working on a new kind of drive unit that is compatible with any battery cell type, and a motor that will be built without any rare earth metals.  Ahead of the 2023 Investor Day, at a press conference on Tuesday, Mexico president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Tesla had agreed to build a large factory in Monterrey, Mexico. He said Tesla agreed to use recycled water and take other initiatives to cope with water-scarcity in the region.  Musk confirmed the factory plans on Wednesday, and said production there would supplement, rather than replace, any manufacturing at other Tesla facilities.  Tesla shares have rebounded from declines during 2022, and are up more than 60% for the year so far. However, the stock dropped 1.43% on Wednesday prior to the event, and 5% after hours.  Mizuho Securities analysts maintained a buy rating on shares of Tesla ahead of Investor Day, seeing Tesla in a leadership position in a growing market for fully electric vehicles. They wrote in a note earlier this week, ‚ÄúNear-term, we see continued strength in TSLA‚Äôs market share, but see cheaper competitor EVs coming to market as potentially dilutive to TSLA‚Äôs share of the US EV market.‚Äù  Currently, the lowest-priced Tesla available is the Model 3 sedan, which starts at a price point of around $43,000, they wrote. Seven models from other automakers are currently priced below that, Mizhuo noted.  Musk‚Äôs ambitious Master Plan Part Deux was published in 2016, and has not been completely fulfilled. It included four main objectives:  ‚ÄúCreate stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage‚Äù  ‚ÄúExpand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments‚Äù  ‚ÄúDevelop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning‚Äù  ‚ÄúEnable your car to make money for you when you aren‚Äôt using it‚Äù.,;,; 2023-03-02 03:31:46]

[Stick with my "Magnificent 7" (well 5) or move to QQQ?,;,; Hey all, I retired recently at age 55 and have been pondering about my investment strategy for the coming years. Specifically, I'm caught between rebalancing my current tech-heavy portfolio, adding AAPL to the mix, or just simplifying life by moving everything into QQQ.   This particular portfolio makes up around 30% of my total retirement savings, and I plan to start drawing it down slowly in about 2 years.        My Current Portfolio      MSFT: \~75%    AMZN: \~9%    NVDA: \~8%    TSLA: \~6%    GOOG: \~1%    Some Context:    I earned my MSFT shares during my career there and am pretty bullish on their future, hence the big slice of the pie they occupy. I added the TSLA in 2016 and sold a few when it had a big gain but again I'm bullish on them. Most of the stocks have been held for at least 3 years.        So, what are your thoughts?        Should I rebalance these existing stocks?    Should I consider adding AAPL to diversify a bit within the tech sector?    Or should I just move it all into QQQ for ease of management?      Just seeking opinions.  &amp;#x200B;  If I don't simplify now I will need to in the coming years. I have a couple of years of cash equivalents available and will rebalance annually.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm not keen to just put it all in in an S&amp;P tracker or whatever as I believe tech will out perform for the foreseeable future.

[Which stocks were predicted to be the next FAANGs and are now biting the dust?,;,; I started investing about 5 years ago in 2018 and hence relatively a beginner. In the last few years several stocks were hyped to be the next FAANGs to generate 100-1000x returns. Some of them were     * PTON - predicted to be the like Nike with $250B+ market cap * ZM - predicted to be a company where millions of people collaborate for work, 200B+ market cap * APPS - predicted to be next TTD (like 40B+ market cap) * OPEN - the next Amazon with $500B+ market cap  &amp;#x200B;  There were many other predictions which sounded ridiculous then, but has now become a reality or  getting there. (Say for eg: In 2018 Tesla car owners were really happy with what they bought and predicted it to be like Apple of EVs but I did not believe and did not invest. This was when TSLA was below 50B market cap. There was another narrative that Nvidia will be the biggest company in the world in next 7-10 years  which I missed too and its now on its path.)

[This doesn't feel sustainable for a nearly $1 TRILLION Company!,;,; tl;dr at bottom   Not trying to start a debate, I'm not long or short $NVDA, don't own any, and I don't plan to open a position anytime soon, I'm just your monthly buyer of $VOO and $QQQ.    However, to the bulls out there, what is the reason for such a MASSIVE premium for this stock?  I understand they crushed earnings and increased foecast to a nearly 50% gain in revenue by Q1 2024, but even with that premium, they are trading at a nearly 200 P/E.    Assuming NVDA maintains that 50% premium and holds it for all 4-quarters in 2024, thats $44B in revenue which if they had 100% margins and zero cost of any kind, it would take you almost 22 years to payback the value of the stock.   Sure, someone will tell me P/Es don't matter, and they are growing like crazy, but at what point is the value of the stock (again, almost $1 TRILLION) still out of control?   \- Their Gross Profit is 56% which is impressive, but not unherd of (MSFT is 68%, META is 80%)    \- Their net income is 16% which is right in line with everyones favoriate not a car company TESLA at 15%  Lets throw out fundamentals since they clearly don't matter that much for this stock and look at their growth:  $7.19B (lower than Q1 2022 of $8.29B).    Their Q4 22 Revenue was $6.05B vs. Q4 21 of $7.64B  So grow is slower/stagnant from the previsous years, so why does that get such a massive premium?  Did they beat earnings estimates, yes, but those were concervitive.  Did they raise guidance by 50% due to the AI boom, yeah, how long will that last?  Same length as the gaming/crypto/at home boom?  Okay, then what, revenue falls again?      TL;dr   People talk about $TSLA being over valued, I've never seen a stock like $NVDA before being this "overvalued" in my life.

[Stocks for shorting in 2024 -Would you?,;,; The last quarter of 2023 (October-December) saw a strong rally in the US stock market, particularly in November and December. While various stocks saw impressive gains, the top performers varied depending on the specific timeframe and metric used (e.g., absolute gain, percentage gain, market cap). Here are some options to consider:        Overall Top Performers:        AppLovin (APP): +255.9% year-to-date (based on 2023 performance), driven by strong AI-powered advertising performance and positive financials.    Symbotic Inc. (SYM): +154.5% in the last quarter, boosted by rapid revenue growth in supply chain automation and AI adoption by major retailers.    Nvidia (NVDA): +122.5% in the last quarter, fueled by booming data center business and optimism about AI applications.    Meta Platforms (META): +85.4% in the last quarter, rebounding from a 2022 downturn thanks to recovering online advertising demand.    Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL): +68.7% in the last quarter, as travel and leisure stocks benefited from easing pandemic concerns.

[Help me understand how Tesla isn't **insanely** overpriced.,;,; Hey everyone. I'm trying to wrap my head around why Tesla's stock is so insanely high with the outlook looking not so great. People keep buying it and I can't understand why, other than people are buying it for a long term AI holding. If thats the case, isn't there FAR better stocks to buy?  https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/price-earnings-peg-ratios  Even looking at 2025, the stock still looks very overpriced at a forward PE of 55.4. PEG ratio is 5.11, lol. I don't know that I've seen a PEG ratio that high before.  There's also some headwinds for Tesla. They recently lost the federal tax credit on most of their lineup. This will undoubtedly affect sales and their margins, but admittedly they should remain profitable without the tax credits. IIRC one of the articles I read said that, without the credits, their margin is around 30%, which is still higher than most auto manufacturers. But still, for this company being valued higher than any other auto manufacturer in the world, even ones that sell exponentially more vehicles, I still don't see how the stock price equals reality.   https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/2023/10/30/5-reasons-why-electric-vehicle-sales-have-slowed/  There has been a slowdown already in electric vehicle sales that will most likely be accelerated by losing the tax credits. Granted that's not all Tesla's fault. We are still a few years away from viable Li-Ion alternatives being ready for mass adoption. Until that happens, the cost of the batteries and rare minerals to make them will remain the biggest hurdle they face. Not to mention hydrogen powered hybrids are slated for mass production starting next year. Electricity rates are constantly increasing. Even if you have a bunch of solar panels, you still paid for that electricity, even if it's cheaper than what you're getting from your utility company. Whereas water is the most abundant resource on the planet. The advantage here does not go for pure electric vehicles IMO.  As far as the AI angle, are they really a competitor when they still only have level 2 autonomous driving? Seems to me like Google would be an infinitely better stock for the AI angle since they are expanding to level 3 and 4 autonomous driving, no? Even if they don't plan on making vehicles, Google seems like the no brainer here and it has very realistic valuations. If im wrong here, please explain why. This post isn't to shit on Tesla stock. I genuinely want to know **if** I'm wrong and why. Thanks everyone!,;,; 2023-12-29 05:19:50]
[Tesla stock hit 8-month high Friday; Cathie Wood sold and made millions,;,; Cathie Wood and her Ark Invest firm cashed in a portion of their Tesla (TSLA) stock holdings Friday with the EV giant hitting eight-month highs and up around 28% in June. Meanwhile, Tesla is ramping up end-of-quarter vehicle delivery incentives.  Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management sold 73,113 shares of Tesla Friday for around $19.05 million, based on TSLA's closing price of 260.54. Friday's Tesla sell-off was done through ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW).        Tesla stock recorded two tiny losses and ended a record 13-day win streak last week. However, on Friday shares rose to a fresh eight-month high. Ahead of Tuesday's trade, TSLA was up more than 70% over the past seven weeks, but still short ‚Äî down around 17% ‚Äî of September highs.        Cathie Wood has been buying up Tesla on the cheap throughout 2023 before selling big in recent days.  On June 12, Wood sold off more than 393,000 shares of Tesla for around $98.2 million, based on TSLA's closing price of 249.83. Cathie Wood's funds purchased more than 1.3 million TSLA shares so far in 2023 and have now sold around 730,000 shares.  Tesla stock jumped 5.3% to 274.31 Tuesday during market trade.  # Final Push For Vehicle Deliveries  Tesla increased discounts on U.S. inventory Model S and Model X vehicles by $2,500 late Friday. Consumers can now get $7,500 off the luxury models after the EV company originally implemented a $5,000 price cut a few weeks ago.        Meanwhile, days after Tesla increased U.S. Model Y all-wheel drive prices by $250, the company now offers discounts of around $500 on some inventory vehicles.        Tesla also appears to be trying to move Model 3 inventory. Last week, the automaker began offering customers who order a Model 3 between June 14 and June 30 three months of unlimited free supercharging, according to the company's website.        In China, Tesla is offering insurance subsidies on Model 3 vehicles. From June 16 to June 30, customers in China who buy and complete delivery of an in-inventory Model 3 rear-wheel drive vehicle will be eligible for an insurance subsidy of about $1,120.        In China last week, Tesla sold 14,500 vehicles, down 12% from the 16,400 vehicles sold in the previous week.        Through June 18, Tesla sold 40,600 vehicles in China, leading sales among "premium brands" in the country.  &amp;#x200B;  # Tesla Stock  TSLA advanced 1.8% to 260.54 Friday. On Thursday, shares fell 0.35% to 255.90 after slipping 0.74% Wednesday, snapping a run of 13 straight gains. Shares are up around 140% in 2023 and nearly 28% in June. However, Tesla stock is down around 37% from the all-time high of 414 it hit in November 2021.        TSLA jumped more than 6% last week despite two straight consecutive sessions with losses.        Tesla stock is well extended past a 207.79 buy point from what's either a cup or a double-bottom base.        Shares are more than 30% above their 200-day/40-week moving average.

[Most hated stocks on Reddit?,;,; I read some of the comments on the recent "[What's a company you love, but whose stock you hate" post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/18yva6k/whats_a_company_you_love_but_a_stock_you_hate/), and unsurprisingly quite a few people said Disney, Paypal, and even Netflix (although hating on NFLX is so 2022).   This made me think it would be interesting to create some sort of Hate Index where we list the top most-hated stocks on Reddit (or on the internet in general), and then measure it against the S&amp;P500 after a year or two. Or maybe it's been done already? Either way, it wouldn't shock me if the Hate Index turned out to outperform the market in the end.  What do you think are some of the most hated stocks at the moment (meaning the ones that generate the largest amount of negative comments, even if they also have a large number of vocal supporters), and is there some sort of sentiment metric we could use to quantify the hate?  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2024-01-05 12:06:30]

[Cathie Wood calls Nvidia stock 'overpriced' after missing 2023 rally,;,; Cathie Wood isn't buying the artificial intelligence hype at Nvidia (NVDA).        The founder of Ark Invest, and noted tech innovation investor, tweeted on Monday that the AI darling is now overpriced.       Nvidia shares have risen more than 30% since the company reported earnings on May 24, and the stock touched a $1 trillion dollar market cap on Tuesday.            Wood and Ark sold their holdings in Nvidia back in January. Since Nvidia's stock has more than doubled as investors have dubbed the company the clear leader in the AI chipmaking arms race. In just the past week, Nvidia announced revenue guidance that blew away Wall Street estimates and followed that news up with new AI-focused product launches.   It hasn't just been Nvidia stock soaring, either. On Friday, Marvell Technology (MRVL) said the company expects revenue attributable to AI to double the next year. Shares rose more than 30% on the news amid a broader AI-infused tech rally that's continued into Monday's trading session.   With the Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) now up more than 2.5% in the last five days, Wood argues there are going to be other winners in the AI space outside of Nvidia.   "Other companies with visionary leaders, strong global distribution and, perhaps most important, large-high-quality pools of proprietary data should be big #AI winners, with revenues and earnings surprising significantly on the high side of expectations during the years ahead," Wood tweeted.   There will be "dozens" of AI winners, according to Wood. But the one that stands out to Ark, as it often does, is Tesla (TSLA).   Wood argues that at six times revenue, Tesla stock is far cheaper than Nvidia's current 25 times revenue valuation.   "(Tesla) is the most obvious beneficiary of the recent breakthroughs in #AI, as it aims for an $8-10 trillion revenue TAM in autonomous mobility by 2030," Wood wrote.   With several positive headlines in the news of late including a growing relationship in China, Tesla shares are up more than 7% amid the broader tech rally.     Wood's Nvidia comments come as her flagship ETF, the Ark Innovation Fund (ARKK), has struggled to return to its pandemic dominance. The ETF skyrocketed during the risk-on bull market of 2020 with high-flying pandemic darlings like Tesla, Zoom (ZM), and even Nvidia contributing to gains.   But as the Federal Reserve enacted its most aggressive interest rate hike campaign in four decades, risky bets became less popular with investors. Some of Ark's top holdings, such as Zoom, Roku (ROKU), and Coinbase (COIN) are well off their pandemic highs.   The fund itself lost more than $1 billion in market cap in 2022 with shares falling nearly 67%.,;,; 2023-05-31 10:22:50]

Not because they care about Palestinians but mostly to avoid domestic backlash and not let Iran appear as their sole savior. This also helps Russia, especially as we approach winter.  Considering existing economic conditions and sanctions imposed on Russian, Iranian, and Venezuelan oil the impact of such an embargo will be significant. EV stocks, especially TSLA should rally.

It doesn‚Äôt make sense. PE ratio is good, and it‚Äôs the second largest in the world in car sales.  You could say sales are declining, but so does Ford‚Äôs (even more), but it didn‚Äôt tank that much.  They keep manufacturing a very diversified range of cars from cheap boring to supercars (indirectly through child brands, but still), and even though its sales isn‚Äôt expected to be growing as much as Tesla, but comparing the two is still a joke, and in my opinion Tesla will never be even close to sales of Volkswagen. Still, Tesla‚Äôs valuation is 10x Volkswagens.  I don‚Äôt mean to start comparing the two, and soon it won‚Äôt even be relevant as Tesla is not an automobile only company, but let‚Äôs be honest - electric, and self driving cars becoming less and less exotic. Volkswagen is quick to adapt, and pick up latest technologies to put in their cars and sell them for cheap. They provide good price value ratio, and for most people that‚Äôs what counts.

[Short sellers go after renewable and EV stocks,;,;     Short sellers are taking positions against electric vehicle and solar stocks, which have experienced a decline in their value recently. A report from Hazeltree, a treasury and liquidity management platform, indicates that luxury electric vehicle startups like Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID), as well as EV giant Tesla (TSLA), were among the top 10 most shorted stocks in the large and mid-cap sectors in October.        The report also assigns a "crowdedness" score, representing the securities that a high percentage of funds are shorting. Interestingly, ExxonMobil (XOM), an oil giant, emerged as the most crowded large-cap stock in October, replacing Tesla after four consecutive months as the top shorted security.        In the small-cap sector, renewable energy companies Sunrun (RUN) and Sunnova Energy (NOVA) were among the top 10 most crowded securities, with a high percentage of funds shorting these stocks.        The decline in the value of solar, wind, and electric vehicle stocks is attributed to industry headwinds and a higher interest rate environment. Short selling involves borrowing a stock and selling it on the open market with the intention of buying it back later at a lower price when the security is repurchased, which is known as covering the short or closing out the position.        Notable declines in these stocks include Rivian's 35% drop since mid-July, Lucid's 49% decline over the same period, and Sunrun and Sunnova's drops of more than 50% since mid-July.            ,;,; 2023-11-10 11:11:49]

Very quickly I could see how the random stock picking portfolio based on recommendations was garbage.   Then I came across the basic ETF strategies. So I made a Voo and chill portfolio, an 80/20 Boglehead portfolio and 6 portfolios based on MPT. They mostly all hold 6 tickets but one has 12. They are all high Sharpe ratio and have low variance because I chose stocks with very low correlation.

[Turning 18 and Investing,;,; My dad introduced me to investing at a pretty early age. He agreed that he would give me $100 each month after I proved my investment knowledge to him.  He asked me multiple questions about the economy and finance. I passed his test, and he fulfilled his promise. I hope to be grateful for what he has done in the future.  I started investing with an actual custodial brokerage account at the age of 17, receiving $100 every month. I studied the market the best I could at that time. I was trading weekly, making multiple investments per month (20‚Äì30) and trying to sell at a profit of 2%.  I woke up at 6 am (6:30 was market open) and always looked at chart movement. I was always caught up on any news for stocks and studied from just raw experience. (still do this now)  Right now, as I just turned 18 last month, I have $1320 in my account and am wondering if I should dedicate my money from my internships to "trading weekly" or diversify and lean towards index funds.  My experience with stocks has been ups and downs. I did not allocate and put all my eggs in one basket for multiple trades and allocated over $400 dollars, but then made critical mistakes and lost money during TSLA and NVDA Earnings. I haven't tested options and never will, but I got greedy during the last earnings reports for them and invested 25% of my portfolio in both of the stocks during earnings. I had around $1700 before making these mistakes.  Right now, I am still holding those shares (TSLA has almost recovered), reflecting that I am going to make money from my internships to pursue using that money to trade weekly or open a fidelity account and start investing in index funds like VOO.

[Berlin, Intel strike deal on $33 billion chip plant after months of subsidy talks,;,; BERLIN/STOCKHOLM, June 19 (Reuters) - Intel (INTC.O) will invest more than 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in Germany as part of its expansion push in Europe, the U.S. company said on Monday, a project key to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ambitions to create a global chip hub.        The deal, which involves two leading-edge semiconductor facilities, involves 10 billion euros in German subsidies, a person familiar with the matter said.        Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said he was grateful to the German government and the local state of Saxony-Anhalt, where the company plans to built one plant, for "fulfilling the vision of a vibrant, sustainable, leading-edge semiconductor industry in Germany and the EU".        Under Gelsinger, Intel (INTC.O) has been investing billions in building factories across three continents to restore its dominance in chipmaking and better compete with rivals AMD (AMD.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Samsung (005930.KS).        The deal in Germany would be Intel's third big investment in four days, following a $4.6 billion chip plant in Poland and a $25 billion factory in Israel.        Both the United States and Europe are trying to lure big industrial players via a mix of state subsidies and favourable legislation, with Berlin concerned about losing appeal as a place to invest.        The German government is investing billions of euros in subsidies to lure tech companies to Germany amidst growing alarm over supply chain fragility and dependence on South Korea and Taiwan for chips.        Berlin is currently also talking with Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) and Sweden's electric vehicle battery maker Northvolt about setting up production in Germany, having already convinced Tesla (TSLA.O) to build its first European gigafactory there.        Frankfurt-listed Intel shares were 0.3% lower at 1316 GMT.        The chipmaker last year announced plans to build a big chip complex in Germany, along with facilities in Ireland and France, as it seeks to benefit from the European Commission's eased funding rules and subsidies as the EU tries to cut its dependence on U.S. and Asian supply.        It has not yet specified the exact size of the investment.        Gelsinger told Reuters on Friday that the gap between what Germany had offered and what Intel needed was too big but he expected to reach an agreement, adding that his request was to be cost competitive.        "We lost this industry to Asia, we have to be competitive if we're going to bring it back," he said, adding the overall investment for the site would be "tens of billions of dollars".

[Why is option trading risky?,;,; Im still a noob learning the ins and outs of options trading.   I saw someone posting on WSB they bought 14k worth of calls on TSLA with strike price of $206 expiring september. He bought this when Tesla crashed a few weeks ago, down to $160.   This week Tesla jumped to $170, and that alone netted him $7k profit.  This seems like free money or easy money. Of course Tesla is bound to have a few pumps. It doesnt have to reach $200 by September, all it had to do was move in the upward direction and it made him $7k. How is this risky?? You dont have to wait till september and you dont have to wait till it reaches $200.,;,; 2023-05-06 17:21:32]
[teslaa delivery analysis based on Q3 deliveries,;,; The top comment on the thread  https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16xxnsa/tsla_q3_deliveries_fall_short/  talks about tesla reducing production due to the upgrade of factories to the new models.  yet I remember it clearly last year it was the discussion that tesla is worth so much more because of how big their backlog is (ie orders placed but not fullfilled yet).  but you can clearly see here: https://insideevs.com/news/679888/estimated-tesla-order-backlog-jul16-2023/  that the order backlog didn't increase in a meneaningful way similar to the lockdown periods / semiconductor shortage.  which means tesla delivered as much as the customers wanted more or less.  I do belive that between:  1. recession in Europe.  2. compatition: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65643064 china becoming the world's top car exporter, japan and gemrany after.  3. chinese market (which used to be the highest growing to the auto industry) is locking out western companies due to trade wars.  4. inflation/reduction in margines.  in my opinion the growth story tesla has sold is running on fume.,;,; 2023-10-04 07:54:10]

[In 5 Years, Who do You Think Comes out on Top in the AI wars?,;,; Microsoft?  Amazon?  Google?  Apple?  Even maybe Palantir?  Nvidia?  Or more than 1 of them?   I think Microsoft is currently the best positioned with it's larger market share with Azure right now,  but Amazon is catching up with Lex and all of the AWS products.  Google seems way behind both companies.   Microsoft (at least right now) is also the most logically and fairly valued P/E wise (unlike say, Nvidia's astronomical PE) and I may dabble with a few grand bc it's cheap.   They also have good cash on hand and good EPS.    Not sure what to make of Apple or PLTR in the AI game, with PLTR some people say their products are the best and most proprietary and others are just "meh" on PLTR and say they are super overvalued.

[Tesla stock extends record streak to 13 sessions,;,; Tesla shares are up a whopping 41% during that time.     Tesla ($TSLA) shares jumped 3.6% today, extending the company‚Äôs record winning streak to 13 sessions in a row. In that time, shares have risen nearly 42%, adding further gains to an already big year for Tesla shareholders.     Tesla stock is rising in tandem with the overall market today on cooling inflation data, but the shares have been on the rise for a couple weeks now. The latest big news came late last week when General Motors (GM) announced it was joining forces with Tesla to leverage the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger Network. The companies announced the Tesla Supercharger Network will be open to GM EV drivers starting next year, and by 2025 GM anticipates its EVs will include Tesla‚Äôs NACs connector, which will allow for direct access to Tesla Superchargers.  GM‚Äôs move comes two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.   Several industry analysts recently told Yahoo Finance that Tesla's partnership with Ford would be a positive tailwind for Tesla's revenue moving forward.   "Recall in our 2022 report that we sized the potential for Tesla opening its network more widely in the next few years (i.e. more than just Ford) at $1-$3 bn of incremental revenue (although Tesla wouldn‚Äôt necessarily capture all of this)," Goldman analyst Mark Delaney wrote in a note following the Ford deal. "We believe the news is a modest incremental positive for Tesla as it will likely bring in additional profits and help Tesla to sustain the most robust charging network, albeit with some risk of fewer vehicle sales."Nonetheless it hasn‚Äôt all been good news for Tesla during the recent run-up, as the stock brushed aside negative reports about the upcoming and highly anticipated Cybertruck. Per leaked internal documents that German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on, as picked up by Wired, Tesla engineers have had some big concerns about the Cybertruck‚Äôs capabilities.   Preproduction ‚Äúalpha‚Äù versions of the Cybertruck were struggling with basic issues like suspension, body sealing, noise levels, handling, and braking, Wired reports. An automotive engineer Wired spoke with said a company like Tesla has the financial resources to address the issues, but the engineer was still ‚Äúastounded‚Äù that Tesla was struggling with some basic engineering issues with the Cybertruck.   Tesla CEO Elon Musk has nonetheless promised the company will hold a Cybertruck delivery event later in Q3, with limited production volumes beginning later this year.

[Tesla reports 422,875 deliveries for first quarter of 2023,;,; https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/02/tesla-tsla-q1-2023-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html  Tesla on Sunday posted its first-quarter vehicle production and delivery report for 2023.  Here are the key numbers from the electric vehicle maker:  Total deliveries Q1 2023: 422,875  Total production Q1 2023: 440,808  Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by Tesla and are not broken out by individual model or region.  The first quarter numbers represent a 36% increase in deliveries compared to the 310,048 reported during the same period a year earlier, and 4% growth in deliveries sequentially compared to the 405,278 they company reported in the last quarter of 2022.  The company reported deliveries of 10,695 of its higher-priced Model S and X vehicles, about 2% of deliveries in the quarter.  Tesla reported deliveries of 412,180 of its lower priced Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover during the quarter.  The company did not include production and delivery numbers for its heavy-duty Semi trucks.   Tesla said it produced 19,437 Model S and X vehicles, and 421,371 of its Model 3 and Y vehicles for the period ending March 31, 2023.  ‚ÄúWe continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds,‚Äù the company wrote in a statement Sunday.  Tesla now sells four models which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the US, one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin. In March, CEO Elon Musk announced the company plans to build a new factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day‚Äôs drive from its factory in Austin, Texas.  The company also produces a heavy-duty truck, the Semi, at its battery plant in Sparks, Nevada. The company began deliveries of the Semi in December 2022.  According to a mean of estimates, compiled by FactSet as of Friday, Wall Street was expecting Tesla to report deliveries around 432,000 vehicles for the quarter. Estimates included in the FactSet analysis ranged from 410,000 to 451,000 deliveries expected.  The independent researcher who publishes under the handle TroyTeslike was expecting deliveries of 427,000 and production totaling 445,920 vehicles.  The first quarter of 2023 was marked by repeated price cuts by Tesla including in the U.S., Europe and China.  Tesla‚Äôs moves sparked a so-called ‚Äúprice war‚Äù in EVs, and posed a challenge to competitors including Ford and General Motors who are trying to gain marketshare in the fully electric vehicle segment domestically.  Tesla shares rose more than 60% in the first quarter to close at $207.46 on Friday ahead of the production and deliveries report. (They closed at $123.18 on December 30th, the last day of trading in 2022.),;,; 2023-04-02 17:18:16]
[Headfirst into the $RIVN pool,;,; I like the stock, what can I say?  Before I go further, this is just a discussion post, not necessarily a ‚Äútechnical analysis‚Äù.  Full disclosure, I‚Äôve just recently yeeted into a decent chunk of my portfolio into Rivian averaging $15.50/share.  Yes, they keep asking for offerings for multiple billions of dollars in new funding, but it‚Äôs for the right reasons, and theoretically the correct results of in just a few years increasing their production capacity from 25k to over 500k. It takes massive capital to due this feat. Something I don‚Äôt think any other EV brand outside of TSLA is able to do, while also having the most superior product in the industry.   The even better news being the demand has only skyrocketed, and (hope I don‚Äôt jinx it with upcoming quarterly report) there doesn‚Äôt seem to be signs of slowing demand. Which is huge because right now their cheapest car is $80k, and they‚Äôre soon announcing their $40k line that should supplement their existing $80k lines and commercial delivery truck lines to hit their max 500k capacity.  To me, my yolo bolo brain. It does not seem like a bizzare bet that in 2026 they sell at their 500k capacity as their popularity within the United States is still climbing, and launching an affordable line is only going to increase interest.   Not to mention it‚Äôs a severely superior car to any Tesla line, and SUV/Trucks are largely preferred over sedans in the wealth class that can afford these vehicles in the U.S.,;,; 2024-02-09 18:37:20]
[Most stupid reason you ever took a position in a stock,;,; We all know how stupid of a reason one can come up with to justify holding a stock but actually what was the most stupid reason you ever brought (or sold short) a stock?   If I remember all those funny stories I learned from others, how they made their money and were actually proud of, there must be tons of stories that are embarrassingly stupid if you think about it.  I was not part of it (I was a SAP pump and dump believer and participant) but I know back at the university there was this company outsourcing drawing cartoons and animated movies to Asia and went big but burned and crashed. The reason why a friend of mine lost all his money on this single stock was he enjoyed a trailer for a movie and went to buy this shit without any due diligence. I call that stupid.

Chip design duo AMD and NVDA have not been dragged down by semiconductors and bucked the trend today. INTC came back from failure, rising 9.35% in the first five trading days.  One strategy is to only buy stocks that have risen sharply rather than stocks that have fallen sharply, because from the lessons of last year, we can understand that thunderstorms have no bottom. Even META TSLA has experienced a collapse of more than 70% from its high point. On the contrary, if the big rising stocks are still 30% to 40% off from the historical high, and the p/e is very low, they are still very cheap.,;,; 2023-03-16 19:15:21]

I'm up 20% since starting this strategy about 6 months ago, versus the overall market being up by about 10% in the same time period. Yes, I understand there's inherently more risk with individual stocks. Also, FWIW, I'm not bragging, just giving some depth to the conversation and my reasoning for asking these questions.

How much of that holding represents your overall portfolio? Are these long-term holdings, or have you purchased shares lately? Why is that particular stock your largest individual holding?

There's a simple question that can tell you whether a company can have tech PEs: do they have unique products that enable them to grow their profit exponentially while keeping their costs linear? If the answer is no, they are just waiting for a correction. Even Amazon's valuation is mostly due to AWS &amp; not their retail side.   For example:  Uber should not have a tech valuation: they are a modern cab company that needs to hire drivers and deal with local presence &amp; its costs grow at the same rate as its revenue. That's why they are not profitable &amp; likely never will be.  TSLA is another one, we can all see now that they want to scale, their margins are shrinking &amp; getting closer to all other car manufacturers.

I broke my rule here because I was on holidays when it dropped.  - Sold CDR before Cyberpunk release and got +120% because I knew it will be reciebed badly by critics but then bought back "at sale" shortly after the fall and sold at a loss seeing how it trends down.  - sold 100 NVDA in 2020 with +60%. Now it would be  +1000%  My overall realized gains is  -$8,000 and ytd is -15%  There is no hope at all for me. I tried to understand the stock market and can't. Since 2020 there is no logic. Penny stocks are doing +1000%, strong companies that have positive cash flows and very low liabilities are just cruising or going down. Bad companies not bringing any profits are exploding because they are being memes.  And I dont know what to do because it looks like the stock market will be flat for the next couple of years and interest rates for real estate are so humongous I don't qualify. I thought the stock market is the way to park money but this + inflation = I'm losing money left and right.  Edit: major stocks that I still hold since 2019. Enph, sedg, dis, msft, AMD, wm, mmm, aapl, atvi.  Edit2: thanks for all the hate!,;,; 2023-09-19 14:43:10]
[Tesla D1 Dojo Chip? Impact on stock price?,;,; So apparently they developed a chip that is far better than NVDA.  I see tesla shills claiming this will send TSLA far above NVDA MC if they release it.

[My 58-year-old father put his entire 401k into Tesla stock. How do you explain the volatility risk and lack of diversification to a parent?,;,; Hi Reddit!  I've (30M) been stressed about my father's retirement savings ever since he told me he converted his entire savings from a normal target date fund to 100% Tesla stock. This occurred in 2020 around the same timeframe of the first stock split, and all contributions to date have been Tesla.  For background both my dad and I have loved the company and their products for years, but we differ in that I think the stock is heavily overpriced, and he has latched on to the valuations and extremely bullish forecasts people like Kathy Woods assign to Tesla. He's convinced the stock is going to rocket to 4 - 10X its current value before he retires, and hasn't really reacted to the bearish arguments I've laid out acknowledging how much more expensive the company is than every other automaker and how competition is increasing in the space. Not to mention that much of its valuation is currently highly speculative such as "robo-taxis" while their FSD is starting to fall behind competitors in execution and is still not (and may never be) fully delivered.  Setting the valuation of Tesla debate aside, I would never advise any person at any age to put 100% of their retirement portfolio in any single stock, let alone one as risky as Tesla. I've tried explaining the extreme risk in a zero diversity portfolio, where if this single company goes under he loses his entire retirement fund ("all your eggs are in one basket"), but he doesn't seem to take it seriously.  My fear is that he is already behind on where he probably should be in his retirement savings. He's told me before he spoke with a financial advisor before doing this, and he didn't have enough funds to manage with them. I feel he is making this gamble as he thinks its the only way to catch up, not recognizing he could also lose it all. I know he has not talked to any advisors since about his current investment strategy.  Some questions I'm hoping you can help answer for him and I, so he has an outside perspective:  If you are neutral or bearish on Tesla, how would you explain the issues and risks with its va;ue going forward?  If you are bullish on Tesla, are you investing 100% of your savings in it, and would you advise a 58-year-old to do the same with their retirement savings? Why or why not?  How would you explain the risk of his current plan to him, and what alternatives would you suggest?  What should an ideal retirement portfolio look like for someone his age?  What resources do you believe would be good to share with him that might help reopen the conversation on reducing his risk and impressing the importance of diversification?  It's not an easy conversation to have with a parent, and ultimately I respect that he's an adult who can do what he wants with his money. I've tried a few times to have it but its difficult to balance not being taken as condescending to your own father while explaining how insanely risky you think his financial decisions are. It's made it more difficult by the high upturns TSLA has taken in stretches, validating all his beliefs, but with the subsequent downturns he's doubled down and not acknowledged the volatility and risk. I fear with him consuming positive bullish Tesla content exclusively, he is not considering bearish outcomes or basic retirement savings advice. Any feedback from the community that can offer an alternative view would be highly appreciated, as I hope I can share some of your resources and opinions with him next time I retry this conversation.  Thanks so much!     EDIT: For those asking, I believe he got in at late August 2020 timeframe, around what is now the $120 - $140 price range.  He has averaged up basically ever since, so not clear on what the current average price is.  I think he is up now on original investment, but down on most continued contributions.,;,; 2023-03-08 15:44:04]
[Question About Good Faith Violations (non-margin/cash account),;,; With a cash account (no margin), let‚Äôs say someone want to make 1 swing trade per day, every single day using their full account balance.

Because I used the proceeds of a sale to purchase another security and then sold the newly purchased security before the original funds used to make that purchased had settled? Or am I incorrect?

[Market trading at high valuations given rates, economy slowing expectations,;,; I don't want to dive super deep. Right now my portfolio has swapped a few times from short term bonds to stocks and to long term bonds. I bought short term bonds in July and moved to longterm when I saw it hit 5% on longer term yields, then the market dropped along with yields and I swapped to stocks thinking I could average down. The market (QQQ) snapped back up at 375 and I swapped back to short term bonds.  I was looking to move to stocks at some point but the valuations remind me a lot of 2021 where large cap tech lead to oversaturation.   I guess my main question is given my portfolio which is 100% bonds at the moment and up 24.7% for the year, should I just go fully stock or should I stick with my fundamentals and believe that the market isn't priced right (especially large cap tech stocks like NVDA, TSLA, GOOGL, MSFT) and wait for rates to fall (and I expect a slowing US economy)?

[Started Investing 9/2021 and Finally Break Even,;,; I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly.  I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation.  I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120...  Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. **On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000.** I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day.  On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. **Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD**.  I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate.  I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day.  Portfolio and 2-year&amp;YTD charts:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk](https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk)  **===============================Update on 7/12/2023 =======================**  **1)**  To reply to several comments below about¬†me deserve losing all my money,¬† uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment¬†decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to¬†someone you don't even¬†know in¬†internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which¬†is highest ever they make.  &amp;#x200B;  **2)** To answer the question about why I hold these stocks:  **UPST**  Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price¬†should be doubled at least if that happens.  Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy.  Comments below questioned my oversized position¬†in UPST. I have large position¬†because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly¬†added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created¬†this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%¬†  &amp;#x200B;  **SOFI**  I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly¬†so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst¬†downgraded SOFI because "personal loans are risky", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.¬†  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage,¬†compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.¬† CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered¬†analysts'¬† doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my¬†confidence¬†in SOFI.  Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank.  &amp;#x200B;  **IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE**  **ZS, CRWD** are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison:  Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s)  Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s)  Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly¬†revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability.  That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector.  I own **NET** even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET  **IOT** is¬†very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have¬†a¬†large total addressable market. They¬†are the leader in their industry.¬†¬†What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it‚Äôs a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily.  **BILL** is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated.  **GLBE**¬†is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE  Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management¬†software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without¬†checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium.  &amp;#x200B;  **Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS**  **TMDX**: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location.   Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It‚Äôs the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession.  **HIMS**: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never¬†happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because¬†analysts criticized their sales and¬†marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me.  Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably¬†a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector.  &amp;#x200B;  **MELI**  A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low.¬†Stock analyst¬†Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company.  **DIS**  I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs  **OPEN**  I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account "operdoor2" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data.  &amp;#x200B;  Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: **TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN**  &amp;#x200B;  **3)** To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover.  I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions¬†per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss.  Just to give a few examples:  I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst‚Äôs downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on¬†Monday are green.  Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from¬† $155¬†just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS.  Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It‚Äôs not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it‚Äôs because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth¬†stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD¬†price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me.   Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking¬†(UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and¬†increased my shares of TSLA¬†and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row¬†¬†this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days.¬†To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA¬†shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back.  Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute¬†buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,¬† I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it‚Äôs $44.  Also post ER¬†overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation¬†stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD¬†last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.¬† And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)¬†¬†  So in short, swing trade and rebalancing  (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far.  Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.,;,; 2023-07-11 20:51:57]

[EV school bus company BLBD.  $9 to $31 (and rising).,;,; I started investing in EV school bus company BLBD at $9/share.  Right before Biden was elected.  I knew that if he won, a national conversion from internal combustion buses to electric would begin.  Today, the stock is at $31.  The EV school bus conversion is just beginning, and BLBD is well positioned for it.  Most school buses fleets are perfect for EV conversion.  Routes and charging schedules are very predictable, and the lower EV bus maintenance costs offset the higher initial investment needed.  And of course, with the Biden administration has come incentives.  Another interesting thing to know is that a charged fleet of buses can be used to power a community in emergencies (this is called V2G, or Vehicle to Grid).  So far my investment has been very successful.  $9 to $31, etc.  BLBD just recieved a record order for 180 EV buses.  They recently delivered their 1,500th EV bus.  They now have an Electric Vehicle Build-up Center with an annual capacity of up to 5,000 electric school buses.  This company is like a mini version of TSLA.  One of the few un-tapped opportunities remaining in the EV space.  Sharing all this because I think it‚Äôs exciting.  I‚Äôm an engineer, and I like the product they build.

[Tesla Gains in Premarket as Analysts Say Dojo Offers Asymmetric Advantage,;,; [https://tokenist.com/tesla-gains-in-premarket-as-analysts-say-dojo-offers-asymmetric-advantage/](https://tokenist.com/tesla-gains-in-premarket-as-analysts-say-dojo-offers-asymmetric-advantage/)  Morgan Stanley has given Tesla's stock a substantial boost, citing the potential of the company's newly launched supercomputer, Dojo. The Wall Street bank believes Dojo could add up to $500 billion to Tesla's enterprise value, primarily by accelerating the development of robotaxis and network services. This optimism led to a more than 5% surge in Tesla‚Äôs premarket stock price and prompted the bank's analysts to upgrade the stock from Equal-Weight to Overweight.        Dojo is aimed at enhancing Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology, positioning the automaker at an "asymmetric advantage" in a multi-trillion dollar market. The bullish outlook by Morgan Stanley provides a welcome lift for Tesla, which had faced a volatile stock performance and recently cut prices on some models. Despite these challenges, Tesla‚Äôs shares are up about 130% in 2023, indicating a strong rebound and promising prospects for further growth.,;,; 2023-09-11 15:29:24]
[WSJ - Detroit automakers entered labor talks at cost disadvantage to Tesla,;,; Tickers mentioned: GM, F, STLA, TSLA  * Meeting UAW's initial demand would increase total average hourly compensation from $66 to $136 an hour vs. $45 at Tesla, according to Wells Fargo.  They are asking for a 32-hour work week but annualized on a 40-hour week that would be approximately $283,000 in total compensation. * It would further widen Tesla's tremendous advantage in efficiency as legacy automakers try to steer a costly transition to a future away from carbon emitting gas vehicles. * A key difference in compensation is TSLA employees tend to get cheap options that can increase a lot in value if the stock moves up. * ‚ÄúThis is our generation‚Äôs defining moment,‚Äù Fain said late Thursday before the walkout. ‚ÄúThe money is there. The cause is righteous.‚Äù * ‚ÄúCompetition is code word for race to the bottom, and I‚Äôm not concerned about Elon Musk building more rocket ships so he can fly in outer space and stuff,‚Äù Fain told CNBC on-air Wednesday.  https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/uaw-strike-tesla-labor-costs-baf8b897  More than a day into the United Auto Workers strike against the Detroit automakers and one thing is clear: Elon Musk has already won.  And the billionaire tycoon isn‚Äôt even involved.   Musk won before the strike began early Friday. He won before negotiations started two months ago. From the get-go, General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis were expected to spend more on wages because of the union‚Äôs pressure. The question is just how much of an increase, and so far their offers haven‚Äôt pleased the union, igniting this past week‚Äôs work stoppage.  **Whatever happens, more money surely will be spent. Any wage increase further advances Tesla‚Äôs already tremendous cost advantage in EVs over its older U.S. peers, which are contending with generations of legacy expenses while trying to steer a costly transition to electric from gas-powered vehicles.**  In March, Musk revealed plans to build on his advantage by setting a goal of slashing manufacturing costs for the automaker‚Äôs next-generation vehicles by 50%, an ambitious agenda that will depend upon advanced automation, savvy engineering and other changes.   The Tesla chief executive‚Äôs actions this year have shown how Tesla can take advantage of a lower cost structure to engage in price wars with rivals around the world to juice sales.  In July, Tesla reported second-quarter profit that rose 20% even after reducing prices. Around the same time, in the midst of steep losses from its electric vehicles, Ford said it would slow its EV production growth.   All of this is playing out as the UAW seeks more than what the Detroit automakers say they can afford and remain competitive. The companies have offered wage increases of varying sizes reaching as high as 20% over four years, while UAW President Shawn Fain countered with a mid-30% increase, down from a previous ask of at least 40%.   **The Detroit companies‚Äô labor costs, including wages and benefits, are estimated at an average of $66 an hour, according to industry data. That compares with $45 at Tesla, which isn‚Äôt unionized and was founded 20 years ago. Meeting all of Fain‚Äôs initial demands would boost average hourly labor costs to $136 for the Detroit companies, Wells Fargo estimated.**  A key difference between Tesla‚Äôs compensation plan and that of the UAW workers revolves around company upside. UAW workers have been getting profit-sharing bonuses while Tesla workers receive stock options, which don‚Äôt have a direct cash cost to the company. Over the years, Tesla shares have risen like a rocket, though there have been periods of turbulence. Shares this year have more than doubled.  Fain argues that past contracts haven‚Äôt kept up with inflation, hurting the union‚Äôs roughly 146,000 auto workers‚Äô spending power, and that members‚Äô sacrifices have helped make the companies profitable in recent years.   **‚ÄúThis is our generation‚Äôs defining moment,‚Äù Fain said late Thursday before the walkout. ‚ÄúThe money is there. The cause is righteous.‚Äù**  Shortly afterward, Ford responded, saying the union‚Äôs demands would ‚Äúmore than double Ford‚Äôs current UAW-related labor costs, which are already significantly higher than the labor costs of Tesla, Toyota and other foreign-owned automakers in the United States that utilize non-union-represented labor.‚Äù  Many analysts, so far, are expecting that the Detroit companies will ultimately absorb the added costs. ‚ÄúThe much larger issue is that it adds incremental pressure to their already challenged transition to an EV world,‚Äù Dan Levy, an analyst for Barclays, cautioned investors in a recent note   Fain this past week sounded annoyed when asked about Tesla‚Äôs cost advantage.   ‚ÄúCompetition is code word for race to the bottom, and I‚Äôm not concerned about Elon Musk building more rocket ships so he can fly in outer space and stuff,‚Äù Fain told CNBC on-air Wednesday. ‚ÄúOur concern is working-class people need their share of economic justice in this world.‚Äù  Focus on the labor-cost gap is a classic part of Detroit negotiations‚Äîraised by executives, investors and analysts every cycle. Before Tesla, there was Toyota Motor and its nonunion pay rates.   U.S. automakers spent years arguing that Asian rivals, without UAW contracts, benefited from cheaper labor costs that allowed them to plow savings into cars that appealed to consumers.   Narrowing the labor-cost gap was a key part of the painful restructuring of the auto industry around 15 years ago, when union members made unprecedented concessions to help save their employers and their jobs.   Art Wheaton, a labor expert at Cornell University, suggests that the UAW‚Äôs ability to get higher wages could help put heat on Tesla during any renewed effort to organize there.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Elon Musk has all of that superwonderful, high-polished glow anymore,‚Äù he said, noting the controversies the billionaire has had regarding his recent ownership of Twitter-turned-X. ‚ÄúSome of that patina has been wiped clean.‚Äù  The UAW had its best shot in years to organize Tesla during labor strife in 2017 and 2018, when workers were feeling the burn of ‚Äúproduction hell‚Äù at what was then the automaker‚Äôs lone assembly plant outside San Francisco as it struggled with the Model 3 sedan.  But the organizing effort failed.  The National Labor Relations Board has ruled that Tesla violated U.S. labor law in its handling of the matter, including statements by Musk that were considered threatening when he tweeted that hourly workers would lose stock options if they joined the UAW. An appeal by the company, which has denied wrongdoing, is pending.   Musk has suggested that employee stock options make his factory workers the highest compensated in the industry, saying ‚Äúquite a few‚Äù line workers have become ‚Äúmillionaires over the years from company stock grants.‚Äù Options allow workers to buy stock at a certain price after working at the company for a set amount of time.   At Tesla, the average pay for a manufacturing technician can range from $23 to $32 an hour, according to estimates by Glassdoor. Tesla advertises factory jobs in California with expected pay ranging from $24 to $67 an hour plus cash and stock awards and other benefits.   On Thursday, Musk took another jab at the UAW, after essentially daring the union last year to try again to organize his workers, boasting that his factories ‚Äúhave a great vibe.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe encourage playing music and having some fun. Very important for people to look forward to coming to work!‚Äù he tweeted recently. ‚ÄúWe pay more than the UAW btw, but performance expectations are also higher.‚Äù,;,; 2023-09-16 13:58:38]

[Thoughts on this Strategy: Zombie-Free Indexing,;,; We all know indexing has many advantages. If you aren‚Äôt aware simply google them. One of the main drawbacks is you tend to get the good the bad and the ugly. It drives me nuts knowing my index funds hold/held zombie companies like JCPenny, Macy‚Äôs, GM, airlines, etc when many of these businesses are obviously not good or have tough futures. They exist, but they ain‚Äôt thriving or haven‚Äôt thrived in years.  So I thought, what if i had a basic way to screen out the zombie companies. For me there are a few elements of all businesses that are basically universally good:  Sales are growing, shareholders aren‚Äôt diluted, debt is low, there are healthy gross margins and valuation is reasonable. I use these elements are to develop a ranking system. That‚Äôs it. They can have no or plenty of operating profit, net profit, ROEs, and so on.  Many factor based strategies look for the metrics included above but I feel that is not a great idea. In my view, there are just too many counter examples to focus on ‚Äúfactors‚Äù to make them reliable (AMZN, TSLA, CRM, NOW, etc). Hell a dividend can be interpreted as a sign the company doesn‚Äôt have good investment opportunities. And no operating profits (in the case of AMZN/CRM) were the results of aggressive investments in dominating businesses.  I took this theory and ran it in portfolio123 which has controls for backtesting biases and anecdotally looked into a few companies:  A company like Macy‚Äôs never qualified in the past 20 years.  NVDA first made the cut in 2015 when it was at $5 or $6 (split adjusted)  Kohl‚Äôs never made the cut.  Disney would have made it and been kicked out, PayPal still showing great fundamentals despite it‚Äôs getting obliterated.  I'd love to hear your thoughts and engage in a discussion about this investment strategy. Do you think focusing on the metrics above would lead to a better portfolio in the real world?  Thank you for reading, and I look forward to your insights!,;,; 2023-12-03 02:36:29]

[It‚Äôs year 2030, what are the world top 5 largest stocks?,;,; My bets, in no particular order: AMAZON, APPLE, MICROSOFT, BERKSHIRE, and COSTCO.   Amazon's growth is impressive, driven by its expanding e-commerce reach in a market that's still not fully tapped. This juggernaut isn't slowing down anytime soon.  Apple's success lies in its thriving ecosystem, especially its booming services like Apple Music, iCloud or Apple TV. Innovations and strong financials keep it at the forefront, not just maintaining but possibly growing its market presence.  Microsoft stands strong with AI and cloud computing innovations. Its financial resilience and predicted growth in these sectors, along with gaming new bet, make it a likely candidate for continued success.  Berkshire Hathaway's diverse investments by one of the world best capital allocators underpin its steady growth. Their strategic planning and financial acumen, along with discussions on future leadership, suggest a stable and prosperous path ahead.  Costco's growth is powered by its expanding membership and strategic global presence. Their operational efficiency and stable financial performance position them well for the future.  I bet you‚Äôll disagree. Love to hear your thoughts.  Happy Holidays.,;,; 2023-12-22 17:10:44]

[I cannot predict but I will go the risk free route here,;,; **The current macro situation:**  Our so strong economy is cracking left and right, rates came up quick in the US and also here in Europe (I am from the EU). Economy kept up really well, people had excess savings, yada yada yada. Now the market adjusted last year and then the AI craze (which I don¬¥t wann discuss or try to "value") happened and basically we reverted to the mean.   So here we are seeing that finally the economy is turning, China is bad, Europe is also starting to go south and even the US is seeing a slowdown now. The jobmarket is still a bit stronger than usual, but "great" jobs are already rare again, and in general the most recent numbers locally and globally are showing a turn.  Yields are skyhigh, the ECB might hike once more this week as Inflation here is not going down fast enough. And the markets? Well they are pretty damn high, today TSLA went up 10% again, thats just the icing on the cake.  Now nobody can predict if all this will again lead to a repricing, (which looking at all the data in the past is the highly expected outcome...) anytime soon, but what I can say for 100% is that yields are paying you again.   We already had a strong rallye and again the data tells us that in such strong opening halfs it¬¥s much more likely we see a slower or worse second half. Overall I look at the total amount of data and it¬¥s just a skewed risk reward that favors going into yield products and waiting it out.   &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-09-11 17:41:04]

[How US stocks rose 20% from their lows, and where they might be going,;,; U.S. stocks have defied fears of a recession, a banking crisis and soaring Treasury yields to rise 20% from their October lows - one definition of a bull market.        The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index closed at a low of 3,577.03 on Oct. 12, 2022, down 25% from its all-time high after the Federal Reserve unleashed a series of bruising interest rate increases to fight decades-high inflation.        On Thursday, it closed up 0.6% at 4,293.93, amid growing optimism over the economic outlook and a rate hiking cycle that appears to be nearing its end. Here are some features of the index's rally, and a look at where stocks might go from here.  While markets seldom rise in a straight line, the S&amp;P 500's journey from the bottom took 164 days - the longest 20% climb from a bear market low in five decades. Among the factors holding stocks back was a surge in Treasury yields to their highest levels in decades that dulled the allure of equities by offering investors the potential to earn attractive income in government-backed bonds.        A crisis that saw the biggest bank busts since the Great Recession also shook investor confidence, as did worries over a potentially catastrophic fight over lifting the U.S. debt ceiling.  The narrow breadth of the S&amp;P 500's rally has been a concern for some investors, with just seven stocks - Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) - responsible for almost all of the index's gains this year. Many investors view these stocks as safe bets in uncertain times. Their gains were also driven by excitement over advances in artificial intelligence.  More recently, however, the market's gains have shown tentative signs of broadening out to other stocks.  Meanwhile, volatility has subsided - not only in stocks, but in Treasuries and currencies.        One reason for the calm in markets is investors' belief that the Fed is unlikely to deliver many more of the rate hikes that shook asset prices last year.        Investors have also been encouraged by evidence showing that the U.S. economy continues to be resilient in the face of the central bank's monetary tightening, while inflation slowly cools. The U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (.CESIUSD) shows U.S. economic data has in aggregate topped market expectations, helped by stronger than expected numbers for employment and consumer spending.        A 20% gain from bear market lows has in the past heralded further upside for stocks.  In four of the last six bear markets, the S&amp;P went on to rise 20% or more in the six months after hitting this milestone.

[Tech stocks have completed their largest three-week surge since the early days of COVID in April 2020.,;,; Tech investors are entering the Thanksgiving season with optimism as the Nasdaq rises 2.4% in a week, marking a 12% gain over three weeks‚Äîthe strongest rally since April 2020. Intel stands out as the week's biggest winner among large-cap tech stocks, surging 13%, driven by robust demand for PCs following better-than-expected profit and sales reports. Mizuho Securities upgraded Intel to a buy rating, citing a renewed focus on the data center business and positive prospects in the customer pipeline.  Next week, the spotlight shifts to semiconductors, with Nvidia set to report results. The stock has surged 22% in three weeks, boasting a year-to-date gain of 237%, outpacing other S&amp;P 500 members. Nvidia's strong performance is attributed to its role in generative artificial intelligence, providing graphics processing units (GPUs) for powerful workloads. Analysts expect revenue growth of over 170% for Q3 and anticipate Nvidia's forecast to suggest close to 200% growth in Q4.  Eric Jackson, founder of EMJ Capital, considers Nvidia his "top large-cap name" and sees the tech market in the early stages of a rebound, linked to the potential end of Federal Reserve rate hikes. The market is sensitive to interest rates, with low costs encouraging risk-taking and higher rates directing investors to safer assets.  Tame U.S. inflation data, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) remaining flat in October, boosts the broader market. The week's large-cap gainers also include Tesla, rising 9.2%, despite CEO Elon Musk's controversial social media post. Musk's comments drew condemnation from the White House for promoting antisemitic and racist hate, contrasting with American core values.,;,; 2023-11-18 11:03:41]
[QQQ vs SPY ratio: rollover happening,;,; This selloff off the most recent top is not broad based. The big tech darlings are leading the decline.  The QQQ and the SPY are equal for the most part except that the QQQ has a higher weighting of tech while the SPY has oil and gas, banks, and various other non tech sectors.  The strongest sector last week was probably oil and gas. Look at XLE, USO, DBC, etc. All were up.  The last time there was a rollover in the QQQ vs SPY ratio was after the August 2022 top. It didn't go back up until after the bottom in December. The one prior to that was the rollover at the end of 2021.   The entire market is not melting down. The oil and gas sector is bullish. The VIX is tame. Treasury yields are rising. Crypto just tanked. Big tech retail favorites are getting hit. This is more like the beginning of 2022. Not the beginning of 2023. GDP estimates are freaking 5.8% for the 3rd quarter. Headline CPI has bottomed. Energy CPI is going back up.  It seems many Youtubers are still bullish the tech favorites like TSLA and PLTR and buying the dip. Anyone buying up the hated commodity sector?  I think there is a probability that we see a repeat of the market similar to most of 2022. Big tech and crypto weakness while banks and energy do well.,;,; 2023-08-19 07:29:16]
[Microsoft stock hits a record high. Why its next move might be lower,;,; Microsoft stock reached a new all-time closing high‚Äîbut there could be some hiccups ahead in the short term.        Microsoft's stock rose 1.1% to $360.53 on Tuesday. That's a new closing high, topping the previous high of $359.49 set on July 18. Furthermore, Microsoft has won for eight days in a row, its longest winning streak since January 28, 2021.        The stock has been helped by the company‚Äôs strong earnings and sales, which got a boost from the Azure cloud business.        But it‚Äôs not just earnings. Microsoft was already outperforming its peers following tech weakness in August and September. Its stock has gained 15% since the end of September, outpacing Amazon.com (AMZN), which has risen 12%, Meta Platforms (META), which has risen 6.5%, Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), which is up 6%, Alphabet (GOOGL) which has ticked up 0.3%, and Tesla (TSLA), which has dropped 13%.        So, why be concerned? It all comes down to the 14-day relative strength index from Microsoft. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a measure of a stock's or index's momentum, or lack thereof. The closer it comes to 20 on the negative, the more oversold it is, while a score close to 80 indicates that the stock is extremely overbought. A value below 30 usually indicates that a stock is about to rally, while a score above 60 indicates a likely decline. Microsoft's RSI is at 72.75, indicating that it is becoming quite overbought and that a pullback is possible.        That doesn‚Äôt mean Microsoft isn‚Äôt worth buying for its long-term potential. The company has a lot to recommend, including a cloud business that should get a boost as ChatGPT, which held its developer conference yesterday, looks to expand. It just means that investors might get a better opportunity to pick up shares in the days ahead.        ,;,; 2023-11-08 11:35:51]
[5 Most Common Investing Mistakes (and my safeguards),;,; I went through a lot of surveys on investing mistakes and compiled a list of the 5 most common ones. My input in this is the safeguards that I have in place that help me avoid these mistakes.  As human beings, we're facing all kinds of risks in our lives. Often times we have certain safeguards in place, whether that is conscious or not.  Think of the time you were taught that before passing on the other side of a street, you need to take a look left and right (or right and left, depending on the country you live in). If we dissect this simple event, the risk comes from all the vehicles on the street and the safeguard is taking a look to make sure it is safe.  Now, in the world of investing, there are plenty of risks, but not that many articles when it comes to safeguards. I hope that this post is helpful to some, so let's dive right into the 5 most common mistakes:  # Mistake #1 Listening to others  Buying or selling stocks based on someone's opinion is oftentimes a bad idea. Today, there's an overload of information and it comes in various forms (Reddit posts, Tweets, YouTube videos, news articles, etc.). Many times, these are written in such a way that they sound convincing as if it is a great opportunity. In some cases, the average reader/viewer acts upon them. Of course, not all of these opinions are bad, but acting on each and everyone is generally a proven recipe to lose money.   This is why there are plenty of posts **"Hey, I have X number of shares in company Y. The stock price is down 20% since I invested, should I hold the shares or should I sell?"** \- Every time I see a post such as this one, it is quite clear that that person doesn't know the value of the holding. This is the outcome of buying shares because of someone else's opinion. The solution is definitely not asking again for the next action.  **Safeguard: Do your own due diligence**  This can be time-consuming, but it works for me. I often times stumble upon articles/posts/videos that seem very convincing and contain a solid investment thesis. But I am aware that the person behind the information could've missed something important. So, I note down the ticker, and sometime in the future, I analyze the company myself, without bringing any bias in the process.  &amp;#x200B;  # Mistake #2 Trying to time the market  "I'll invest after the market crash and then I'll sell on the top" - This sounds amazing, doesn't it? The problem is that there is no successful long-term investor who timed the market over a long period of time.  Here's a title of an article written back on March 28th, 2016: 'Rich Dad' author says the 2016 market collapse he foresaw in 2002 is coming.  Oh, where do I start? Robert Kiyosaki, in 2002, foresaw a market collapse in 2016 (that never happened). He continued banging on the same door, about the market crash being here and eventually, he was right, it happened in 2022! However, the S&amp;P500 was up 100% since this article. So anyone who "waited", well, that turns out to be a terrible decision. For every market crash that someone predicted, there are 10 others that the same person predicted, but never happened.  Now, let me be clear, I have no respect for this type of individuals that make money by selling content (articles, videos) that are based on fear ("OMG THE WORLD IS CRASHING!") or the complete opposite ("THIS STOCK WILL 10X IN 2 YEARS!"). But we are surrounded by such content and it is important to acknowledge that none of these individuals have a magic ball.  **Safeguard: Ignore such information**  &amp;#x200B;  # Mistake #3 Overestimating the future growth and/or profitability  If there's a mistake that I'm most guilty of, it is this one. It happens mostly when someone is looking at a company and imagines a bright future. However, being too optimistic means assuming higher growth/profitability that the company eventually delivers. These high and unreasonable assumptions I put in the category of "wishful thinking".  **Safeguard: Apply margin of safety**  I'll best illustrate this through an example. I valued Tesla at $190/share. The average cost per share of Tesla in my portfolio is $150/share. I know that I could be wrong in my assumptions, so I waited for a better entry point.  &amp;#x200B;  # Mistake #4 Confirmation bias  This seems to exist most when someone:  \- Owns shares in a certain company  \- Has emotions about the position in that particular company  \- Really wants to be right that it is a good investment  The outcome in some cases is confirmation bias. Basically, trying to find information that confirms the thesis and ignores the ones that don't.  **Safeguard: Don't be arrogant, nobody knows everything. Businesses change over time, so adjust the assumptions accordingly**  When presented with a new piece of information, it is important to be objective and assess the impact it has on the fundamentals of a certain business and incorporate it in the valuation. If that new piece of information changes the investment decision from buy to sell, so be it.   &amp;#x200B;  # Mistake #5 Failing to monitor the investments  This is the easiest mistake to make, but also the easiest to prevent. Companies change, there are decisions being made fairly often and some of them have an impact on (part of) the business. To make sure you're up to date and have the most recent information, there's a simple safeguard.  **Safeguard: Read the public information coming from the company directly**  The last 4 words of the safeguard are important. Otherwise, it's mistake #1 all over again and the focus is not on facts, but on speculation.  &amp;#x200B;  I hope that you enjoyed this post!,;,; 2023-03-05 18:34:05]

[Should I buy different ETFs depending on the type of account? IRA account vs. Individual Investment account.,;,; My mother recently passed away, and I inherited two Fidelity accounts that she had. One of the accounts was her IRA account. The other was an individual investment account. After taking a look at both of them, I realized that she has a ton of money in bonds. This made sense for someone her age, but for me, I'd like to completely revamp these accounts since I'm 32 years with a much higher risk tolerance.    She also has a ton of different individual stocks (over 70 different individual stocks) that I'd like to consolidate and use mostly ETFs instead. I will post my portfolio plan of action below. My main question is, should I be focusing mainly on ETFs that are dividend driven for the IRA account? While focusing mainly on non-dividend ETFs for my investment account? I know that with IRA accounts, you do not get taxed on dividends as yearly income like you would for investment accounts. I plan on buying the following ETFs for my investment account.   50% VOO (ETF)- Vanguard 500 Index Fund - 500 largest companies.  15% VTI (ETF)- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund - Overall stock market.  10% AVUV (ETF)- Avantis US Small Cap Value -  US small-cap.  10% QQQ (ETF) - Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 - Invesco QQQ - Technology, NASDAQ top 100....Apple, Google, Microsoft, ect.  10% Individual Stocks - NVDA, META, AAPL, AMZN, MCD, TSLA, SHOP, etc.  5% XXUS (ETF)- VXUS-Vanguard Total International Stock ETF - ETF with international exposure.    Should I approach my IRA account any differently? For example instead of these ETFs mentioned above, maybe get more dividend driven ETFs such as SCHD, VYM, SPYD, DGRO, etc?,;,; 2023-09-05 00:05:30]

[Does anyone have reservations about selling their stocks?,;,; I have 2 accounts with Fidelity that this is regarding: an outright brokerage account and a cash management account. My brokerage account has mostly individual stocks with a few growth ETFs in it, and my CMA has "safer" value ETFs whose dividends reinvest and the rate is better than HYSA out there.       In total theres about $40k between both accounts. I'm looking to buy a new car within the year and the plan is to sell some stocks out of my brokerage account. The trouble is I feel like I'm screwing future me out of gains - future FOMO? Just a sample: I have Apple (up 61%), Amazon (up 38%), MSFT (up 196%) and IBM (up 59%). I don't do options because I don't understand them and choose not to gamble.       I know the point is to make money with stocks but I'm trying to be smart how I spend. These are not associated in anyway with my retirement which are completely separate.         Help me get over this hump.,;,; 2024-01-25 18:03:50]

[Stocks VS Index and ETFs investing.,;,; I don't have the benefit of time and compounding on my side. What is the benefit of owning individual stocks unless you are trying to beat the market, which even the professionals don't always do according to the stats?  I've been investing over 20 years, I'd be happy to track the SPY, or a little better, by selling calls and puts on SPY and QQQ, and my other holdings, when the timing is right. Current holdings. SPY, QQQ, XLE, XLV SCHD DGRO, and  few REITs, like O WPC STAG for a little higher yeild. For some higher beta exposure I'm holding a few like, NVDA, TSLA, GOOG, ETSY, CRM, AMD, BX MS ect, as a smaller part of my portfolio. If I can get average returns of 7-8% over the years, mainly staying in indexes and ETFs, and another 7-8% selling covered calls and cash secured puts on my holdings, who wouldn't be happy with 16% a year?

[Is Tesla the Ultimate Investment? Garry Breaks Down the Numbers, Growth, and Unveils the EV Game-Changer!,;,; According to Garry, Investment advisor,Tesla ($TSLA) currently sits at $250 per share, trading at 58 times his estimated 2024 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $4.30. Garry's take on this? He believes it's a reasonable valuation, especially when considering the projected +28% increase in volume and an impressive +32% growth in EPS between now and 2030. This positions Tesla's Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio at 1.8x, notably lower than Apple's ($AAPL) 3.0x PEG.  Garry's outlook extends to global EV adoption, forecasting a rise from the current 13% to a substantial 60% by 2030, sporting a +24% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CGR). With faith in the Cybertruck and Tesla's $25,000 next-gen vehicle, Garry expects Tesla to boost its global EV market share from 16% to 20% by 2030. The outcome? Tesla's vehicle volumes surging from 1.8 million in 2023 to 2.4 million in 2024 and an impressive 10.2 million by 2030 (+28% CGR).  Factoring in aspects like auto gross margin expansion, contributions from energy, operating leverage, and cash reinvestment, Garry foresees Tesla's Adjusted EPS climbing from $3.20 in 2023 to $22 in 2030 (+32% CGR). Interestingly, Garry's projections don't include potential revenues from Full Self-Driving (FSD) licensing, robotaxi ventures, or other futuristic elements. However, they do consider FSD at a 15% global take rate and energy revenues rising by a factor of eight.  The central question, as per Garry's analysis, is whether a P/E ratio of 58x is too steep for the premier EV player, set to experience a +28% CGR in volume and +32% CGR in EPS. Garry challenges you to find another mega-cap stock with this level of growth and valuation, particularly with traditional automakers pulling back from their EV commitments. In his view, Tesla stands out as the primary investment opportunity in the evolving EV landscape.,;,; 2023-12-19 10:39:22]
[A Lamborghini-Style EV: BYD Goes Upmarket to Outmaneuver Tesla,;,; * [Yangwang, a BYD brand, makes an electric vehicle that resembles a Lamborghini.](https://images.wsj.net/im-915094?width=780&amp;size=1.4988290398126465&amp;pixel_ratio=1.5)  * [BYD vs. Tesla market share.](https://i.imgur.com/oP0EnLO.png)   Chinese automaker expands its electric-vehicle lineup to more than 20 models in its push overseas and into higher price brackets  https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/a-lamborghini-style-ev-byd-goes-upmarket-to-outmaneuver-tesla-2b698578  HONG KONG‚Äî BYD overtook TSLA as the world‚Äôs top electric-vehicle seller by pumping out a range of affordable cars that gave Chinese drivers what they wanted: choice.   Now it is moving into the luxury market as it prepares to take on the world.  BYD is releasing the cars under a different brand, Yangwang, marking a strategy shift from relying on lower-priced runarounds to producing less conventional vehicles that come with a hefty price tag. They include a $150,000 supercar that resembles a Lamborghini and an SUV that it says can rotate 360 degrees on the spot and float in water‚Äîfeatures that turn heads in China‚Äôs cutthroat car market where buyers chase the latest smart technology.  Tesla, meanwhile, banks on continuing strong global demand mostly for its Model 3 and Model Y cars, which it refreshed last year. Tesla‚Äôs Cybertruck, its first release in years, isn‚Äôt available in China, though the automaker is planning to take the vehicle on a roadshow in the country.  In China, the world‚Äôs biggest EV market, Tesla‚Äôs market share has been shrinking: BYD now sells five cars to every one that the U.S. automaker does. BYD‚Äôs popularity has surged as it cranks out new and varied models at a rapid pace, growing its portfolio of electric vehicles to more than two dozen models, catering to almost every taste and budget.   Backed by Warren Buffett, BYD has become so dominant in its home market that sales in the country enabled it to dethrone Elon Musk‚Äôs automaker as the bestselling global EV brand last quarter.  BYD also has ambitious export and expansion plans. BYD has topped EV sales charts in Thailand and is quickly rising in markets including Australia and Israel. It is building factories in Brazil, Hungary and Thailand. Its first chartered cargo ship with a capacity for 7,000 vehicles set sail for Europe this month.  Whether BYD can repeat its home success on the global stage depends on whether it can translate the formula winning over Chinese buyers to international consumers. In the U.S., South Korean carmakers Hyundai Motor and Kia are emerging as Tesla‚Äôs biggest competition by offering a broader range of vehicles.  Challenges loom large for BYD as Chinese carmakers face pressure on profit margins at home, deal with a subsidy probe in Europe, and remain largely shut out from the U.S., where BYD has long had ambitions to sell passenger EVs.   Beyond existing U.S. tariffs on Chinese cars, the Inflation Reduction Act will exclude cars made with Chinese components from EV tax credits. For now, the company has been manufacturing and selling buses and trucks in the U.S. Its current strategy is to focus on commercial vehicles in the U.S., a company spokeswoman said.   **Export ambition**  BYD expects to export 400,000 cars abroad this year, a goal that is achievable, said CMB International analyst Ji Shi. Exports offering higher profit margins are likely to become the next engine of growth for BYD, HSBC analysts wrote in a note earlier this month.   BYD has yet to make much progress toward its main prize: Europe. BYD is estimated to have sold around 13,000 cars in the European Union last year, far from Tesla‚Äôs 270,000, according to figures compiled by data firm GlobalData.   In China, BYD held almost 12% of the passenger-car market and Tesla under 3% for the first 11 months of last year, according to figures compiled by GlobalData. Tesla was the market leader in electric vehicles four years ago. While Tesla‚Äôs Model Y remained the most popular electric car in China last year, BYD claimed half of the nation‚Äôs 20 bestselling electric models as it churned out new minivans and sedans.  BYD ‚Äúhas the China market completely covered for the most part,‚Äù said Tu Le, consultant at Sino Auto Insights.  This month, Tesla cut prices in China for some versions of the Model 3 and Model Y, the latest fluctuation over the past year as carmakers engage in a price war in China. Tesla‚Äôs refresh of its Models 3 and Y last year added new features such as ambient interior lighting and a smaller rear screen, features that analysts said were already common among Chinese EVs and might not move the needle for Tesla.    Tesla didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment.  While Tesla has fended off past challenges from a range of Chinese automakers, BYD‚Äôs move upmarket presents drivers with more prestigious homegrown choices over foreign rivals.  A price tag of 150,000 yuan, equivalent to around $21,000, used to be the ceiling customers were thought to be prepared to pay for Chinese-branded vehicles, a BYD executive said. Customers flaunted their status with an imported Western vehicle as there were no Chinese-designed cars priced above a million yuan, BYD sales representatives said.  **Delivery ceremonies**  Yangwang luxury vehicles are sold through direct-sales showrooms separate to BYD. Customers picking up their vehicles are offered a delivery ceremony, complete with balloons and floral decorations for special occasions such as a birthday, marriage proposals or anniversaries.   Buyers of its hybrid U8 SUV have the car key delivered in a gift box, nested with a miniature of the vehicle. BYD videos show the U8 doing a full 360-degree ‚Äútank turn‚Äù on the spot, which has garnered a lot of attention on Chinese social media.   Jin Songchang, a Chinese businessman, was shopping for an off-road SUV to drive across China‚Äôs vast provinces once he retires. After months of test driving luxury foreign cars, he finally whipped out a deposit for BYD‚Äôs U8, which costs just over $150,000.   Jin said he was swayed to BYD after company founder Wang Chuanfu said at its launch event that the U8 can run steadily on just three wheels if a tire bursts, thanks to its four powerful in-wheel motors. Jin placed a deposit the next day.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always appreciated foreign brands more. BYD is the first one I decided to buy on the spot,‚Äù added Jin, who said he owns many cars.  Together with its other two high-end car brands, BYD counted more than 135,500 orders of premium and luxury cars in 2023, according to company data. The U8 SUV will be available in Brazil, the company said last year.    BYD has yet to open up sales for its supercar, the U9, after it was revealed at the Shanghai Auto Show in April. The sports car can accelerate from 0 to 62 miles in two seconds. This month, Yangwang teased its coming luxury sedan.  BYD is following the footsteps of companies such as General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen with its family of different car brands, analysts say.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no global automaker that just sells one brand, outside of Tesla,‚Äù said Le, the consultant.,;,; 2024-01-22 22:45:24]
[Buys / Sells Weekly List - How do I sell?,;,; I have had some good success with choosing stocks that will go up and go down weekly.  So far, my weekly returns if I bought/sold stocks on a weekly basis would be:  Week 1: 2.89% (-2.91%)  Week 2: 1.09% (-2.12%)  Week 3: -1.72% (5.12%)  Week 4: 4.76% (1.24%)  Investing in a hypothetical $5,000 split between positions equally and buying/selling each start and end of the week, I'd be at $5,354 or 7% gain over four weeks. Investing this same amount in SPY, and buying/selling weekly, i'd be at $5,056, or 1.1% gain over four weeks. I know this won't be consistent, but I'm ready to start looking at the next step.  Part of my approach involves buys AND sells. If I only did buys, i'd be at $5,256. So, not as strong of a performance, but still better than SPY. Interestingly, only sells would put me at $5,268, so roughly the same as only buys.  **My question is, how do I do the sell portions of my picks?** I know that some stocks, like TSLA, have TSLQ, the short equivalent, but most stocks don't have this. How can I enter into sell trades with the same risk/reward as buy trades. I know shorting is dangerous, but i'd be opening and closing each week and would clearly have stop loss levels in case of a major correction.  I could do puts/calls, which have been successful with this setup because of the runners on one side or the other. If I guessed which side was gonna work every time, I'd be doing really well!  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-11-12 17:11:18]

[What is your process for discovering/reviewing stocks?,;,; I've been trading for a couple of years and lately I've been doing very well by paying attention to relationships and divergences among stocks/ETFs/commodities. Trying to understand and exploit the ebb and flow among sectors. Attempting to identify where long-term accumulation is taking place. First and foremost I watch SPY/QQQ/IWM, ES/NQ/RTY, VIX/VX, DXY/USD, and the 10Y. I also watch the SPDR Sector Funds like XLK, XLF, XLV, XLU, XLY, XLE, XLP, XBI, etc. Additionally, IWC (micro-caps) and IJH (mid-caps).   And VTI (whole stock market ETF) and VT (whole world market ETF) I watch on the weekly chart to get a sense for where the world markets are trending in general. I haven't branched into other markets much, mainly focused on identifying   1) where the current strength in the market is   2) whether the market is remaining orderly/non-volatile   3) how much divergence is taking place among sectors/stocks (e.g. last year felt like indiscriminate selling, this year the divergences are tremendous)  For individual stocks, I basically rifle through stocks with setups that interest me and I really lack organization for what I have on my charts during a trading day. I use Thinkorswim and typically have about 20 charts up across 3 monitors. It's been a challenge to manage my screen real estate and I still change things up all the time, haven't found a solid methodology I guess for what I have pulled up. Undoubtedly what you have pulled up can effect what you trade, how you perceive the market throughout the day, etc.   A lot of times I have AAPL, TSLA, GOOG, AMZN, up at all times. From there I have a mix of stocks from other sectors, maybe a couple wildcards like a small cap/squeeze name. But generally my goal is to display to myself options that I'm unlikely to be severely wrong on, or end up taking a big loss on. I go through and adjust what I'm looking to every night, but admittedly I do need more organization, journaling, and operating more systematically.    So what is your process for evaluating the market? Discovering stocks and setups. What do you have open during the trading day? How many charts? Do you purposefully limit what you see? Do you use any websites/tools to organize your watchlist(s)? Give me your wisdoms,;,; 2023-07-04 18:57:31]

[What's your one stock pick if blue chip stocks are off the table?,;,; Hey everyone,  Let's imagine a hypothetical scenario where you could only invest in one stock. Which stock would you choose and why?  &amp;#x200B;  Now, to make things more interesting, let's also exclude all blue chip stocks from the list of options. Blue chip stocks, such as Apple or Amazon, are typically considered to be the most stable and established companies in the stock market. So, we're looking for some lesser-known stocks that still have potential for growth.  &amp;#x200B;  Perhaps you've been following a certain company that's been flying under the radar but you believe has a lot of potential. Or maybe you're an expert in a particular industry and know of a company that's poised for growth in the coming years.  &amp;#x200B;  Whatever your reasoning may be, I'm curious to hear your thoughts. Please share the stock you would choose and why you think it's a wise investment. Let's discuss!,;,; 2023-03-16 06:43:27]

Just was curious what other stocks might make sense for my portfolio that are higher returning and relatively safe whether individual stocks, or index funds. And or more "up to date" - meaning they're still relevant or will be in the future. Or have historically done well and are expected to continue to for awhile, if that makes sense.

[Seeking Advice to Redirect My Stock Investing Habits,;,; I'm reaching out to this community because I seriously need your help with my stock investing journey. Let me tell you my story, and I'd be absolutely stoked if you could lend me a hand.  Back in high school, when I was about 15, I started getting into money and investing. Somehow, I managed to save up around $7,000 USD by investing mostly in TSLA and doing a bit of trading. Then, out of the blue, I struck gold with GME when it was only $3. You remember the GME rollercoaster, right? My portfolio went ballistic and hit $100,000 USD at the peak of $500! But here's where things went haywire ‚Äì I had no clue when to bail out, and man, I lost a big chunk of my profits. Now, I'm left with around $10,000 USD (could've been $20,000 USD, but I made a boneheaded move by dumping $10,000 USD into BBBY based on a friend's "hot tip").  I've been holding onto these GME shares for what seems like forever, and nothing's happening. So, it's time for a change, and I'm seriously pumped to redirect my investing game.  Now, I'm here, hoping you guys can teach me the ropes on how to research companies and level up my investing knowledge. Seriously, I'll soak up all the knowledge you're willing to throw my way. I know I've got lots to learn, and I'm totally cool with that. I know there's no other way than admitting I don't know anything and I that I should start changing that through learning.  Please I'd love your help. If you've got any resources, books, articles, videos, blogs or personal tips or anything really, I'd be eternally grateful if you'd share them with me. I appreactiate everything.  Thanks a million for reading this, excited to see how this goes.  If it helps I'm not from the states, I'm from Argentina which makes this kind of money "still be good after all that". I'm 21 currently and studying CS in one of the best universities here. I have an Italian citizenship so I plan on going to Europe after this. In my mind this money I'm saving/investing is for when I need to travel and basically make things easier there.,;,; 2023-07-25 13:44:06]
[(4/10) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,;,; # Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, April 10th, 2023-  *****  # [S&amp;P 500 futures decline to start the week as investors‚Äô recession fears grow: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html) ***** &gt; S&amp;P 500 futures declined on Monday, as investors looked ahead to key inflation data and the start of first-quarter earnings season. ***** &gt; Futures tied to the broad market S&amp;P 500 fell 0.18%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures was little changed. Nasdaq 100 futures shed 0.49%. ***** &gt; On Thursday, the major averages rose to end a holiday-shortened trading week. However, only the Dow notched a weekly gain of 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posted weekly losses, ending lower by 0.1% and 1.1%, respectively. ***** &gt; The market was volatile as economic data showed signs of a weakening labor market. The March jobs report on Friday showed a resilient economy and moderate inflation, however, which pushed stock futures and Treasury yields higher. The New York Stock Exchange was closed for Good Friday. ***** &gt; Nonfarm payrolls grew by 236,000 for the month, about in line with the Dow Jones estimate of 238,000, the Labor Department reported. The unemployment fell to 3.5%, against expectations that it would hold from the previous month at 3.6%. ***** &gt; Investors are in for a busy week of economic data, including the latest consumer price index and producer price index data ‚Äì due out Wednesday and Thursday, respectively ‚Äì which will be key in determining if or when the Fed will pause or put an end to its rate hiking campaign. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúOur guess is the equity market needs economic Goldilocks, a bit of slowing to continue to cool inflation expectations, but not too much to spark ‚Äòhard landing‚Äô fears,‚Äù Raymond James‚Äô Tavis C. McCourt wrote in a Sunday note. ***** &gt; They‚Äôll also get the first batch of companies reporting first-quarter financial results. Tilray Brands kicks things off Monday.

[Tracking the "chart master" for October,;,; So just for fun I'm going to plant this stake in the ground with television's "chart master" Carter Worth's call from last week.  I track him and others regularly, and though his methods are amusing, I'll be darned if he doesn't have a pretty good track record.  So I'll post this and track it over the next month to see how it plays out.  He cited his common theme of looking for sector charts that have risen too much, and swapping them for those that have fallen too much.  Simplistic, but whatever.  His call for October was that energy especially had been straight up uncorrected, and was time to "take measures" meaning sell, short, raise cash, take profit.  Same with tech.    His oversold sectors to deploy the capital from those are Financials, health care, staples and utilities.   Based on emphasis, he was essentially saying swap your energy stocks for financials.,;,; 2023-10-02 21:41:07]

S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures were down 0.1% each. ***** &gt; The tail-end of earnings season pressed on with results from Dave &amp; Buster‚Äôs and Stitch Fix. Dave &amp; Buster‚Äôs gained about 3%, while Stitch Fix added 5%. ***** &gt; Stocks edged higher during Tuesday‚Äôs session. The broad index added 0.24% to finish at its highest level since August 2022, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.36% to end at its highest close in 2023. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked 10.42 points higher, or 0.03%, pressured by health stocks Merck and UnitedHealth. ***** &gt; Seven major S&amp;P sectors finished Tuesday‚Äôs session with gains.

I obviously know to take this advice with a grain of salt, however, I've come to trust reddit over the years (writing that sentence just seems ridiculous lol) and am curious for your opinions.  About me; I know next to nothing about the market -- I'd like to invest into something I really don't have to pay too much attention to. I don't mind the ebbs and flows of the market, however, it needs to be something I really don't need to stay on top of.

S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures gained 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. ***** &gt; The White House said Tuesday that Biden has directed staff to meet daily on outstanding issues. The president also canceled the second leg of an upcoming international trip given the negotiations, the White House said. ***** &gt; House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said that a ‚Äúbetter process‚Äù is now in place for further talks. He also said that it‚Äôs ‚Äúpossible to get a deal by the end of the week.‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚ÄúPeople are going to try to be anticipating what the next headline will be,‚Äù said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot at stake, and, unfortunately, there‚Äôs not a lot that we can sort of guess as to what will happen.‚Äù ***** &gt; Concerns over the potential of default weighed on investors in Tuesday‚Äôs regular session. The Dow led the major indexes down with a 1% drop, followed by the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite with respective losses of about 0.6% and 0.2%. ***** &gt; Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen reiterated her warning that the government needs to raise the limit immediately as the country faces the possibility of defaulting as early as June 1. ***** &gt; Disappointing quarterly revenue and a lower forecast for full-year performance from Dow member Home Depot also soured investor sentiment in Tuesday‚Äôs session. On the economic front, April retail sales were weaker than anticipated by economists polled by Dow Jones. ***** &gt; In addition to tracking any updates on debt ceiling negotiations, investors will watch for data on housing starts and building permits on Wednesday.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/rHOeY2Z.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kBcndTD.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/bscbztX.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oAZ5D0l.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/L0ZK81t.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/IxpkQ8E.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/YUkUHrQ.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/VwFYwj2.png)**)  *****  #THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/lXDTRyP.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/6AW2tVr.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QovR6k8.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/B89eTFO.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/EMZ2IoQ.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NlV7pFj.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ReYB5CD.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/17/stocks-making-biggest-premarket-moves-wal-tjx-wynn-tsla-and-more.html)**)  *****  &gt; **Western Alliance** ‚Äî Shares popped 12% premarket after Western Alliance said its deposit growth for the current quarter exceeded $2 billion as of May 12, up from the $1.8 billion in deposit growth for the quarter through May 9.  &gt; #**STOCK SYMBOL:** WAL  &gt; * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=WAL&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l)  &gt; ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/WAL)**)  *****  &gt; **TJX Companies** ‚Äî Shares fell about 1% after the retailer reported a revenue miss before the market open.

[Question Regarding Stock Inclusion in an Index and Index Rebalancing,;,; Hello r/Stocks,  I have a question that I am hoping someone with knowledge about how ETF rebalances work.    From what I gather, when a new stock is added to something like the S and P 500, there is an effective date given during the press release of the S and P Global.  During the time from the press release and the effective date, is the S and P 500 index having funds reconstitute their compositions to match the % of the newly added fund? Does this reconstitution happen during the duration from the time of announcement to the inclusion date, or does it happen before market opens on inclusion date? But if it happens before market opens, We should expect to see massive volume and price going up due to the new demand coming in. Often times, we do see massive volume, but the stock may trade sideways or even go down. This leads me to think the volume prior to the inclusion date are the index funds buying.  I know there is also a rebalance date. This is where I am a little confused. During rebalance dates, is that also when funds are forced to change their portfolio to match the % composition of the index representation? Or is it just an audit when that day arrives where funds should already be in the correct positional % of the new inclusions.  I hope my question makes sense, and thank you for anyone who has any information / understanding of this for answering.,;,; 2023-09-13 20:50:05]
[Changes in this sub/cash on the sidelines = bullish for growth stocks?,;,; I started investing during the height of the 2021 bubble. I didn't know a lot so, thank God I was smart enough to slowly ease into the market. I quickly found this sub and came to know the tickers that people were excited about - a lot of ASML, NVDA, AMD, SOFI, ZOOM, PYPL, TSLA, SNOW, SHOP - and a host of ARKK stocks at the very top.  Well, since the bubble burst and these stocks either came back to Earth - or worse - crashed fantastically, I've noticed that growth stocks are kind of rarely mentioned around here outside of the big tech giants, some of which represent more value than growth.  Outside of a few, the high-fliers are dead. I haven't heard a peep about ASML or, say, SOFI, or cybersecurity stocks in a while. Yet, under the surface, a lot of growth stocks have absolutely sky-rocketed from the bottom or, conversely, are still hovering around 52 week lows.  My points to you all are two-fold:  1. Many retail investors - especially the ones excited about growth stocks - have been wiped out of the market. There's little excitement left for these stocks and, in my view, that's bullish. It means there's been a serious de-risking. There are people who contend that the worst is yet to come and that we've seen nothing yet - but I'd argue that the hyper-growth side of the market has already experienced it's 2001-style reckoning. I really don't have conviction that there isn't more pain to come, but it seems to me that it's time to start seriously scrutinizing these companies to find the very best ones. 2. There is an absolute fuck-ton of money in money-markets, T-bills, and cash. People are bearish. I know we've just experienced quite a rally through Q1 but there are *still* many, many growth stocks that are down very low. We've had some very bad news recently with OPEC, bad jobs numbers, SVB, but - at some point - the market will begin looking past these things and start looking ahead. You could get in when it's more clear that conditions are improving - likely the safer bet - or you could start really digging to find potential value in the broken dreams of 2022 to catch the most upside.  I personally was never interested in the vast majority of stocks regularly brought up in this sub; I like to focus on semiconductors, and mostly not the names mentioned here. That being said, I'm seeing some tickers that are beginning to pique my interest: SOFI, DDOG, ENPH, WOLF, INVZ, CRWD, are a few. I've only opened small positions in a few of these because I'm a pretty cautious investor, but I'll be looking to add if entry points become even more attractive.  In sum, I contend that it might be time start getting excited for hyper-growth again during a time where it seems like everybody hates these stocks and there's a ton of money parked in cash. I'd be curious to see what people think.,;,; 2023-04-06 06:56:28]
[Five stocks/mutual funds/ETFs/Bonds you‚Äôd invest for 20-25 years,;,; Looking to diversify. I‚Äôve held back because I‚Äôm long CRM and still think it would do better in the long run (20 years).

[(3/8) Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,;,; #Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, March the 8th, 2023-  *****  # [Stock futures are flat following a selloff fueled by Powell‚Äôs comments: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/07/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)  ***** &gt; U.S. stock futures were little changed Wednesday, a day after a selloff spurred by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell‚Äôs comments indicating interest rates may need to go higher for longer. ***** &gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked higher by 35 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures rose marginally. ***** &gt; The Dow closed nearly 575 points lower on Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 slid 1.53% to close below the key 4,000 threshold, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.25%. The sharp decline for stocks was accompanied by a spike in bond yields, with the rate on the 2-year Treasury surpassing 5% and touching the highest level since 2007. ***** &gt; The shakeup in markets came after Fed Chair Powell spoke before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. He cautioned lawmakers that the central bank‚Äôs terminal rate will likely be higher than previously anticipated due to stubbornly high economic data in recent weeks. ***** &gt; ‚Ä≥[Powell] is being very, very clear that if you look at what happened over the past year and a half, the call on inflation didn‚Äôt pan out,‚Äù Morgan Stanley‚Äôs global chief economist Seth Carpenter said on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell: Overtime.‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think now Powell is very much on board with the idea that he does not want to get caught flat-footed again, and so opening the door very wide for a 50 basis point hike was exactly what he did,‚Äù Carpenter added. ***** &gt; On Wednesday, investors will be closely watching Powell speak before the House Financial Services Committee. Separately, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin will also be speaking on the labor market Wednesday morning. January‚Äôs job openings and labor turnover data is due, as is the ADP jobs report for February.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/HsGVGMM.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Wst3IHQ.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HcA8GOW.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/pieagEG.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/7qdD5RD.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/tdl0lVA.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Z3ONWGB.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/h0tRTXN.jpg)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QFpHu7V.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/VZCrw1w.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/MNR3uor.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QGt9NXc.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/qUTw8it.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bOcHNVM.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/cVs6DqW.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/stocks-making-the-biggest-premarket-moves-crwd-oxy-tsla.html)**)  *****  &gt; **CrowdStrike** ‚Äî Shares of the cybersecurity firm climbed more than 6% in premarket trading after a stronger-than-expected report for the fourth quarter.

[Why Tesla is losing its EV dominance ?,;,;    Tesla ($TSLA) should be looking over its shoulder at the fully charged EVs barreling right toward its castle.  While Elon Musk's non-Twitter creation still has a stronghold on the EV market based on name recognition, market share, and production capabilities, the clear takeaway from this year‚Äôs New York International Auto Show (which Tesla was not a part of) is that traditional automakers such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Nissan (NSANY) are all gunning for Tesla's dominance and lucrative profit margins.   ## Hyundai aims to lead the EV pack  ‚ÄúTesla who,‚Äù Hyundai Motor Americas CEO Randy Parker quipped when Yahoo Finance Live asked about Hyundai's IONIQ 6, an EV that was named 'Car of the Year' for 2023.  The impressive specs and pricing of Hyundai's IONIQ 6 places it in direct competition with Tesla's Model 3, the second-most-popular EV in the U.S. Hyundai's IONIQ 6 starts at $41,600 with a range of up to 240 miles. By comparison, the $41,990 Model 3 reaches 272 miles on one charge.  Gap closed.  ‚ÄúThe IONIQ 6 from a technology standpoint, you can‚Äôt do better,‚Äù Parker crowed.  And it‚Äôs that type of Tesla mentality that‚Äôs likely to test the EV leadership of Musk's EV outfit.  Older automakers known for their gas-powered rides are ramping up their push into the EV market with edgy new styles and attractive specs like those showcased at this year's New York Auto Show, including the Kia EV9, Nissan Ariya, Chevrolet Equinox EV, and Ram 1500 REV electric truck.  These will be added to a class of solid EVs already in the market like Ford's F-150 Lightning and Mach-E and the coming Chevy Silverado.  ## What's next for Tesla  Tesla's Cybertruck isn't even on the market yet. The company is reportedly working on a compact EV dubbed the Model 2, but it's unclear when that will arrive.   S&amp;P Global estimates the EV market will grow from just over 50 models today to 78 by year-end before more than doubling to 160 by the end of 2025.  S&amp;P Global Mobility‚Äôs Tom Libby told Yahoo Finance in a chat that "competitive pressure is pushing OEMs to move quickly,' and that Tesla's market share will ‚Äòkeep declining' as a result.  The inroads into Tesla's dominance are already being felt without question.  General Motors sold more than 20,000 EVs for the first time in a quarter, fueled by demand for its cheaper Chevy Bolt EV, which accounted for 95% of the auto giant‚Äôs EV sales. And according to GM, Bolt sales are expected to soar to reach 70,000 by the end of this year.  That may not sound too impressive when you compare it to Tesla‚Äôs record first-quarter delivery numbers, which totaled 422,875 globally. But data compiled by S&amp;P Global Mobility shows Tesla's competitors are gaining ground.   Tesla‚Äôs U.S. EV share subsequently fell from nearly three-quarters of the market in January 2022 to just over half in January 2023. Within that same time frame, General Motors' EV market share grew from 0.1% to 9.9%, and Ford‚Äôs foothold grew to 8.4%.  The pressure on Tesla is one of the factors forcing the carmaker to slash prices *again*. Tesla marked down its vehicles for the fifth time this year, its latest effort to boost demand and regain lost market share.  "In this EV arms race Tesla needs to defend their turf and customer base with price cuts," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance. "Everyone is trying to catch up. Tesla cutting prices were the near-term pain for long-term gain strategic poker move."  RBC analyst Tom Narayan also thinks lower prices could help Tesla's demand issue, telling Yahoo Finance Live that lower prices are a "great way to really steal market share."  Despite some upbeat outlooks from Wall Street on price cuts and the fact Tesla's stock has been a favorite among investors since the start of the year, shares are still off more than 40% in the past 12 months. That's a much starker decline than competitors Ford and General Motors, with respective one-year drops of 14% and 10%.  The relative underperformance of Tesla's stock proves some investors are looking at its recent price cuts and quarterly delivery miss as a sign of trouble ahead for the electric vehicle maker. And perhaps a sign that mighty Tesla is losing its grip on an industry it has dominated for the last five years.,;,; 2023-04-13 10:36:18]
[These Are The Best (And Worst) Performing Stocks Of 2023,;,;  Driving stocks‚Äô broad rebound over the first seven weeks of the year are several of last year‚Äôs black sheep, including Tesla, the always volatile electric vehicle company helmed by the U.S.‚Äô second-richest man Elon Musk.  &amp;#x200B;   Tesla is the best-performing stock listed on the S&amp;P 500 year-to-date, rising 69%, while the other five best-performing S&amp;P constituents are streamer Warner Bros. Discovery (up 63%), biotechnology contractor Catalent (59%), orthodontics firm Align Technology (50%) and the cruise liner Royal Caribbean (48%), according to FactSet data.  Despite spanning industries, each of those companies have one thing in common: They were among the worst-performing stocks of 2022, each losing 35% or more last year.  Other notable gainers this year are fellow streamers Paramount (40%) and Disney (21%), Silicon Valley technology giants Nvidia (46%) and Meta (44%) and other leisure travel stocks like Norwegian Cruise Line (44%) and Caesars Entertainment (27%).     The S&amp;P‚Äôs biggest losers are also a diverse group, led by telecommunications firm Lumen Technologies (-25%) and followed by solar energy company Enphase Energy (-23%), specialty healthcare provider Baxter International (-20%), energy company APA Corp (-18%) and pharmaceutical and healthcare giant Pfizer (-15%).  The decline of Pfizer, by far the worst-performing stock of 2023 with a market capitalization over $100 billion, comes after the company [said](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/01/31/pfizer-expects-covid-vaccine-and-pill-revenues-will-fall-60-in-2023/?sh=7c9241f37bee) it expected sales for its Covid-19 vaccine and oral treatment will slip 60% in 2023, and headline an onslaught for several big pharmaceutical companies, with peers Johnson &amp; Johnson and Eli Lilly down 9% and 10%, respectively, year-to-date.     KEY BACKGROUND  The S&amp;P 500 is up 6.7% year-to-date after slipping 18% in 2022, its worst annual performance since 2008. The slump closely tracked the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates from around 0% to over 4% in an effort to slow inflation. In addition to Meta, other mega-cap tech stocks are up dramatically this year, with each of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft up 6% or more.  ## TANGENT  Also gaining thus far in 2023 is bitcoin, up almost 50% year-to-date at about $25,000, an eight-month high. Oanda analyst Craig Erlam warned Monday that investors must be wary of the latest rally for the cryptocurrency, explaining: ‚ÄúWe've all seen what happens when enthusiasm and euphoria exist in cryptos,‚Äù referring to bitcoin‚Äôs dramatic 75% nosedive between November 2021 and November 2022.  ## SURPRISING FACT  U.S. military contractor Northrop Grumman is the sixth-worst performing S&amp;P constituent year-to-date, [despite](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/02/15/chinese-spy-balloon-graphic-reminder-of-geopolitical-market-risks-heres-what-it-means-for-stocks/?sh=afd798e78889) a recent rally for it and other defense stocks as geopolitical tensions stewed.  ## BIG NUMBER  $61.3 billion. That‚Äôs how much Musk has tacked onto his fortune so far this year during Tesla‚Äôs rally, roughly the size of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs total fortune. Musk, who lost his position as the world‚Äôs wealthiest person in December, is $15 billion away from reclaiming the title from LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault.  ##,;,; 2023-02-21 06:30:02]

[Top Cathie Wood stock near the buy point is expected to deliver 772% EPS growth.,;,; Cathie Wood often invests in speculative companies with profits that are years away, though Tesla (TSLA) has been profitable for years. So has Shopify (SHOP), a top-10 Ark Invest holding. Thanks to a strategic shift, Shopify earnings growth is expected to skyrocket in 2023, with strong gains continuing next year. And SHOP stock is near a buy point.     **Shopify Logistics Sale**   Shopify announced the sale of its fulfillment business to privately held Flexport on May 4, with the deal closing in June. The e-commerce software giant in recent years had sought to challenge Amazon.com (AMZN) in third-party fulfillment for online orders. But it turned out to be an "expensive experiment."   Shopify now holds a 13% stake in Flexport, but exiting logistics will mean the company can slash costs. Meanwhile, gross merchandise growth is picking up after slowing sharply following the coronavirus pandemic boom.  **Shopify Earnings**    Shopify earnings plunged to 4 cents a share in 2022 from 64 cents in 2021. The end of the pandemic meant a big slowdown in e-commerce growth.        First-quarter earnings, reported May 4 along with the Flexport deal, tumbled 50% vs. a year earlier. Sales grew 25% to $1.51 billion.  **Shopify Earnings**    Shopify earnings plunged to 4 cents a share in 2022 from 64 cents in 2021. The end of the pandemic meant a big slowdown in e-commerce growth.        First-quarter earnings, reported May 4 along with the Flexport deal, tumbled 50% vs. a year earlier. Sales grew 25% to $1.51 billion.  **SHOP Stock**    Shopify stock gapped up 24% on May 4 following first-quarter earnings and the Flexport deal, blasting out of a cup-with-handle base. After peaking at a 52-week high of 65.54 on May 10, shares began to consolidate. SHOP stock briefly broke out to a fresh 52-week high in mid-June, but pulled back with the broader market.        This Cathie Wood stock has once again found support at the 21-day line. Investors could still use 65.64 as a place to start or add to a Shopify stock position. The risks would be elevated if the market pullback is still ongoing.  **Ark Invest Stake**    Ark Invest owns 0.68% of Shopify stock as of June 26. It's the 8th-largest holding across Cathie Wood's Ark ETFs, with a 3.85% weight overall.        While SHOP stock has been a big winner for Ark Invest in 2023, its current position is still underwater. The ARKK, ARKW and ARKF funds have an average cost of $121.32-$128.27.        That's not uncommon. Ark Invest has a big profit in its current Tesla stock holdings. But the other top-10 Cathie Wood stock positions are losers right now, with some more than 75% below Ark's cost basis.

S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.1% each. ***** &gt; The central bank is widely anticipated to hold the benchmark overnight borrowing rate steady in the 5.25% to 5.5% range, but investors will also parse through Fed Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs commentary for clues into how soon rate cuts can be expected. As it is, the CME FedWatch Tool shows markets are pricing in odds of rate cuts beginning next spring. ***** &gt; But that‚Äôs a scenario Powell may choose to push back on, especially as Treasury yields pull back on their own. The 10-year Treasury yield has fallen to 4.2% after topping 5% in October. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúHe may hint that‚Äôs doing some of the prospective easing,‚Äù Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell‚Äù on Tuesday. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs, to me, what I‚Äôm going to be focused on, is whether he sort of does the opposite of what he did when he said that the move up in yields had done some of the tightening for the Fed,‚Äù Sonders added. ***** &gt; Investors will also keep an eye on the November producer price index, set for release 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday ahead of the Fed decision. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a rise of 0.1%, up from a 0.5% decline the prior month. Excluding food and energy, it‚Äôs anticipated to have risen 0.2%, up from a flat reading the previous month. ***** &gt; Investors are coming off a fourth straight positive session. Both The Dow and S&amp;P 500 hit their highest intraday levels since January 2022.

Futures connected to the Nasdaq-100 traded 0.1% higher. ***** &gt; Stocks are coming off a winning week that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average gain 2.3% to notch its best weekly gain since March.

[Is NVO Actually Overvalued?,;,; POSITIONS: Full disclosure I have 405 shares of NVO and call options in 2024.   DATA: Attached are the numbers for PE and PEG 2025 projected out based on 38% y/y eps growth (this is the guidance they just issued during Q3 2023 ER) or about 9.5% per quarter. As you can see, the PE is less than 20 and PEG less than 1. I don‚Äôt have it here. But PE for next year is roughly 25 and the PEG still way under 1.    GUIDANCE: NVO has a history of sandbagging guidance and being ultra conservative. They are hitting 38% right now WITH supply side constraints. So my thesis is that we will see even higher Rev and EPS in 2024 assuming they can keep production growing. Note: they increased production 5 fold in 2023 to keep up with Ozempic and Wegovy demand, and still are restricting lower doses due to demand.   These products are also protected and already defended in court once this year for patent laws. Ozempic til. 2027 and Wegovy till 2031 before legal generics can be made.  So their runway is many years ahead.   OTHER Rev Streams: Aside from the weight loss drugs everyone is crazed about. Novo controls 1/3 of the diabetes market world wide and 1/2 of the insulin market. They are no one trick pony.   SELECT trial: Additionally they plan to release their SELECT trial data Nov 11 this week. This is for their cardiovascular indication of Wegovy. I expect this to be more good news. They are hoping to file NDA this year.   FLOW trial: They also have a trial for CKD or kidney disease ongoing which just last month ended early because the data was so good and it hit the primary endpoint. This data will be shared Q1 2024. This will further their product line and indictions.   INSURANCE: 80% of insurers already cover their drugs. With the new indications and approvals on those. That number will be 100%. Healthy customers. Less need for insurance. Companies will agree to this because it will save them covering major medical bills.   COMPETITION: As previously stated, no concerns about generics for a while LLY is the next closest for approvals this year. IF Mounjaro is approved, which I think it will be, the demand is so strong I think they both feast and NVO sees no impact to their bottom line. Projections for the weight loss side alone are 100B by 2030. This doesn‚Äôt factor in cardiovascular and kidney. There are other companies but they‚Äôre way behind. NVO will have a pill form before their shots are even approved. NVO is targeting 2025 for pills.   FIRST MOVER: Think of it like TSLA in its ramping phase. NVO just lifted off on its S curve of growth. I think MC easily goes up 50% from here. And possibly doubles to 900B in 2025. It‚Äôs hard to scale with demand as it is. It takes time. Yes companies may get approvals in 2024 or 2025. But they will need time also to produce batches. Which is also very expensive. NVO will be by far the most efficient by then with their processes. Everyone else will sink in money to play catch up and that will eat into their margins and revenues. Look at the diff in LLY and NVO in Q3.  LLY is trying hard to catch up and it shows in their expenses and bottom line.   TARGETS: My price targets, if they can just hit the growth they eare seeing now for the next two years at 38% per year (assuming no more growth) are $145 by end of 2024 and $190 by 2025 EOY. This all relies on us avoiding a recession of course‚Ä¶,;,; 2023-11-04 16:04:31]
[Everything I'm watching and Analysing in premarket 16/01. Includes analysis of Tesla, Forex and Levels to Watch for the day,;,; **ANALYSIS:**  * We are seeing a slight decline in premarket. That‚Äôs in part due to the sell off in AAPL and TSLA, which are big components of the indices.  * But we can look more into it and see that there have been a rebalancing of rate cut bets for March this morning, following UK employment data. The chance of rate cut in march is now showing at 66% vs 77% on Friday on CME Fedwatch tool, with chance of no cut rising to 30%.     * This is the result of the move higher in USD in premarket, reaching 1 month highs at the key level of 103.3 on DXY.     * This is in part due to UK employment data which came strong, even though the wage growth came in lower, which led GBP lower.     * We cans ee that because of this volatility in the dollar in premarket, traders are hedging with OTM put options, which has brought skew down slightly. But money flow block traders remain v high.     * Vix has jumped, will likely come down and can fuel buy the dip later in session.    This is confirmed by selling of puts on nasdaq.     * Key levels to watch on TESLA are at 200, a smaller level at 210. * Key level on AAPL is 180. * NVDA and MSFt, both of which have more bullish positioning than other Mag 7 firms, are both green in premarket, but barely.      **Let‚Äôs look at positioning on IWM, since I have been requested this a few times.**      * Spot price is below the key gamma level of 195, and block trade flows are showing increased short selling from hedge funds. Skew is lwoer too.  * All in all, it looks like IWM is positioned to move lower in short term. * We can see from the blue line below that hedge funds have been taking profit since the start of the year.  * Main options are selling fo call options which is bearish.     * [https://imgur.com/a/EwscBn0](https://imgur.com/a/EwscBn0)      * Theres a gamma level at 190, which is likely to be the low of the day.    Below that, Put support is at 185.       **Now a bit on FX:**  * Skew is pulling back a bit on EURUSD after data this morning. We are seeing traders hedge their long with OTM put with strike 1.08. * Still, open interest on 1.10 is v high, we can expect a reversal tot here hopefully soon, depending on data.      **INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH**     * Goldman Sachs released a report that earnings momentum has trended down since the start of Q4 2023, following weakness in Euro area PMIs. They highlighted the chart below to show how profit downgrades have outpaced profit upgrades over the past few months, despite equity prices moving higher. They used this as evidence to suggest equity prices can do some correction this earnings season.  * [https://imgur.com/a/yMaIKSV](https://imgur.com/a/yMaIKSV)      * Deutsche Bank put out a piece where they were clear outliers against the consensus expectation for Q4 2023 earnings to tick lower. Dutch bank. Expects them to come out at record highs.  * [https://imgur.com/a/hz97aZ9](https://imgur.com/a/hz97aZ9)      * Blackrock put out a piece where they argued that the optimism on rate cuts in the US is currently overdone. In a similar piece, Barclays moved back their expectation of first rate cuts in March, now expecting the first rate cut to be in June. Goldman is currently an outlier, as they still anticipate first rate cut for Fed in March, with ECB and BOE tor ollow later.      * Bank of America said in their EPFR report that flows into equity funds went negative this past week to -9.5b from +4.4b the week before.      **DATA LEDE:**  * Australia WESTPAC consumer confidence index decline slightly from 82.1 to 81. It has remained in this range of 79 to 82 for much of the year so this is no major concern.     * Japan PPI comes in hotter than expected, at 0.3% MOM vs 0% forecast. YOY at 0% vs -0.3% forecast.   PPI is a leading indicator of CPI. YOY flat for first time since feb 2021, no increase. That‚Äôs probably not great for BOJ who want to see persistently higher inflation.    * **UK EMPLOYMENt NUMBERS:**   Employment change came stronger than expected at 73k vs 50k forecast. This is the highest read since April last year. Points to a stronger than expected jobs market.    Unemployment rate came in line with expectations at 4.2%   Average earnigns incl bonus came less than expected, at 6.5% vs 6.8% forecast.     * We can see it was a mixed bag. Jobs report mostly came stronger than expected, in the headline employment change number, but the wage inflation aspect came less than expected, and that‚Äôs indicative of future services inflation.    GBP mostly flat on this, although USD is higher, which is hurting the GBPUSD pair.    Makes sense GBP relatively flat as rate cut bets are steady after the data, with 134BPS of 2024 cuts priced.     * **ZEW economic index for Euro and Germany both came stronger than expected, Germany‚Äôs came as highest since February last year.**    Survey showed that more than 2/3 of respondents expect rate cuts by Fed in next 6 months.      **FOREX:**  * AUD is following Chinese markets lower, compounded by the weaker confidence number.     * GBP itself is relatively flat, slightly lower following employment change, but USD is rallying which is hurting the GBPUSD pair. Makes sense GBP relatively flat as rate cut bets are steady after the data, with 134BPS of 2024 cuts priced.     * Euro partly lower as 1 year inflation expectations drop to 1.5 year low.     * Yen slightly higher after PPI numbers, but USDJPY higher on rising dollar.     * DXY up 0.6% to a key level of 103.3    * AUDUSD sitting at 0.66 key level.  * EURUSD broke below 1.09 level * GBP 1.26 as support.      **MARKETS:**  * European markets lower as they follow EURUSD lower this morning. Yesterday was at resistance of 16800, but fell yesterday back to 16.6k. Continued lower during Asian session, then during Europe open.     * HKG50 - broke 16k, now trading at 15.87k. Moving lower as Taiwan election and lack of rate cuts yesterday hurt sentiment slightly.     * SPX: Rejected at 4800 on Friday. Yesterday was flat due to public holiday, around 4780. Moved slightly lwoer during European session.    AAPL weighing on index, down 1.8% in premarket. TSLA down 1.7%    * NASDAQ: down 0.5% in premarket, trading at 16,750. Its below the 2021 high, will be trying to recover this level. Can get rejected there.     * Oil - North Dakota oil production is down 400k barrels per day due to freezing weather, which as a supply restriction, should support price. The fundamentals of the oil market with the Rede Sea tensions is supporting oil, as it maintains the green despite rising dollar which would normally Drag oil into the red.     * US Bond yields moving slightly higher today.      **KEY LEVELS TO WATCH BASED ON THE OPTIONS MARKET:**     * **SPX**: * Call resistance remains at 4800. This will be a big barrier to break and will be a big resistance.    We are seeing some gamma building on 4825, but is small. But some traders are looking higher now.  * HVL is 4745, there‚Äôs a big gamma level around 4750-4745. We can expect this to act as some support.     * Low of the day if we get there is likely to be 4740, says my quant.    4750/4745 to offer some support before then probably.  * High of the day likely to be 4800.    * These levels were drawn without the TESLA, AAPL news included. A big move in AAPL and TESLA and these levels can break.     * **QQQ**: * Call resistance at 410 which will be hard to break.  * If we do break that then next gamma level up is at 412.     * Key areas of support are at 406 which is the HVL   Then below that, the min of the day that my quant is telling me is 404. Expect a bounce from there.     * That‚Äôs around the low of the day from Thursday for those wondering.      **MAG 7 NEWS:**     * AAPL - has offered Chinese customers a 5% discount on iPhone 15s, in a bid to try to drum up demand, in what is currently a flagging market for them.     * AAPL has also decided to remove their blood oxygen sensor from their watch, in order to avoid the US ban. US customs has said that with this change, they won‚Äôt be subject to the ban. AAPL working to roll out the adjusted watch. The ruling for the ban has been taken to an appeals court and expected verdict is today.     * TSLA - Musk has expressed a need to maintain at least 25% stake in Tesla, stating that if such control is not retained, he would prefer to develop AI products outside of the company.     * MSFT - opening up its Ai copilot to consumers and making corporate version available to smaller companies,.

This will offer merchants services such as demand generation, fulfilment etc, in what is essentially a competition to Amazon.     * SNPS finalises $35b deal to buy ANSS.    * BA - Wells Fargo downgrades to equal weight rom overweight, with price target of 225 from 280.     * DE - partnership with SpaceX to link their equipment.     * UBER - shuttering alcohol delivery service Drizly, which they bought for 1.1b 3 years ago.     * Chinese stocks will be lower following Hong Kong market lwoer, particularly XPENG despite it beginning X9 deliveries in China. This is because they are facing CHina related pressure and Tesla related pressure as TESLa will drag the Ev sector down.    * BIDU down on report that links Ernie Bot to PLA AI, and military using AI.     * CPNG lwoer dragged with Asian stocks.     * LEVI cut to equal by Wells Fargo, price target still 13% above spot.     * MTZ downgraded at Baird    * PYPL downgraded at Mizuho    * FTNT down on downgrade from Wells Fargo on billings slowdown.     * INMD - up after issuing guidance for EPS outlook above expectations.

China‚Äôs treasury rates declined, and equity markets sold off.     * Taiwan presidency goes to Lai, although he has no parliamentary majority. This is considered a victory for democracies, and Beijing had labelled him an instigator of War. This could lead to an escalation of tensions, although Lai has affirmed his commitment to keep peace in the Taiwan Strait, and has said he will talk to China on the basis of dignity and peace.    Congress leaders agree to stopgap funding measure, which will fund government through March 1st and March 8th, stopping partial shutdown.     * US lawmakers set to unveil $80b tax package today.    * Consumer expectations for euro zone inflation fell to the lowest level in more than 1 and a half years in November, which could support cuts to be on their way soon.

S&amp;P 500 futures also climbed 0.9%, while Nasdaq-100 futures were up 0.3%. ***** &gt; Regional banks surged in early trading, led by First Republic. The beaten-down bank jumped 21.9%, a day after losing 47%. The SPDR Regional Banking ETF (KRE) gained 3%. Regionals got a boost after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday morning that the government is ready to provide further guarantees of deposits if the banking crisis worsens. ***** &gt; Wall Street is coming off a strong rally, with the Dow surging more than 380 points Monday, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.9%. The action came a day after a forced takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, which was engineered by the Swiss government. Investors also welcomed news that JPMorgan Chase could be advising embattled First Republic Bank on strategic alternatives. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúBank selling appears exhausted and it would take the emergence of fresh deposit problems at a new name to bring out incremental supply, although there‚Äôs very little interest to step in and buy the group, especially the regionals,‚Äù Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, said in a note. ***** &gt; Investors now expect a slower pace of tightening from the Federal Reserve in light of the banking crisis. Traders now are pricing in a 83% chance of a quarter-point rate hike when the Fed wraps its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, according to CME Group‚Äôs FedWatch tool. The probability of a pause is at 16.6%. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúRisks of contagion are rising and could push the Fed to pause the current rate hiking cycle, although this is not our base case,‚Äù said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. ‚ÄúThe Fed will likely signal they are near the end of their rate hiking campaign as recession risks increase and inflation pressures decrease.‚Äù  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/zigPsfW.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WuDZYIS.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/o4kZQFT.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/73vXuqs.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/kkUKWxH.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/JxG6hIn.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/1Kr44Qi.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ao5glH6.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/kUQisGv.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5PQzaqI.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3obokzF.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/vgSfydY.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nqwy9QE.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/upDXKH8.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/21/stocks-making-the-biggest-premarket-moves-.html)**)  *****  &gt; **Tesla** ‚Äî The electric vehicle maker rose 2% after Moody‚Äôs assigned it a Baa3 rating and removed its junk-rated credit.

[UAW Makes Ambitious Demand: 46% Rise in Pay Over 3 Years, Potentially $80B.,;,; &gt;***"I‚Äôve been told I am crazy to raise member expectations this high as we head into bargaining," Fain said in his address. "I refuse to allow employers, the billionaire class, and sellouts to play on our fears."***  UAW president Shawn Fain raised some eyebrows during a Facebook Live video address in early August to the union faithful.  In an hour-long talk, Fain, a 20-year UAW veteran and a former shop chair at Stellantis' Kokomo, Indiana, plant, told members what he had planned for the Big Three automakers ‚Äî GM (GM), Ford (F), and Stellantis (STLA), formerly Chrysler ‚Äî for this year's contract negotiations. The bottom line was this: After all the sacrifices the UAW made over the years, the days of rolling over were done. The bill was due.  The stakes couldn't be higher for the UAW and the Big Three.  The current contract ends on September 14, at which point a work stoppage could occur if they don't strike a deal. The negotiations, if Fain's speech was any indication, will be the most contentious in recent memory. Why? Fain and current UAW leadership believe the union has given up too much in the past.  The increased rancor has already made a mark. Shares of GM, Ford, and Stellantis all dropped steeply last week, largely because Wall Street is concerned that a work stoppage would seriously impact automakers as they navigate a generational and costly electric transformation.  The increased rancor has already made a mark. Shares of GM, Ford, and Stellantis all dropped steeply last week, largely because Wall Street is concerned that a work stoppage would seriously impact automakers as they navigate a generational and costly electric transformation.  'These demands aren‚Äôt going to happen'  **The demands set out by Fain and UAW leadership include "substantial wage increases," which amount to a 46% rise over three years; eliminating compensation tiers for new and old workers (which the UPS Teamsters secured); restoring cost of living adjustments; providing a new pension plan; and reducing work weeks to 32 hours from the standard 40.**  Making such demands in public ahead of contract talks isn't typical for the UAW and the Big Three automakers.  In the past, the UAW and Big Three went behind closed doors to negotiate after a contract was hammered out. The UAW then presented the proposed contract to its members for a vote.  Publicly releasing contract demands could backfire for the union, putting pressure on the leadership to avoid compromise and therefore up the likelihood of an impasse with the Big Three negotiators.  **But the tough-guy talk may be a plus: Fain, in essence, may be preparing the rank and file for a long, rough fight ‚Äî a fight brought on by the costs facing the Big Three given these demands. According to Bloomberg, the cost of the UAW demands could amount to $80 billion over the course of the contract, which typically lasts three to four years.**  Fain's demands caught the automakers' leadership off guard.  "Everyone understands these demands aren‚Äôt going to happen ‚Äî it would be suicidal for the companies to agree to this," one industry source told Yahoo Finance.  The UAW's wish list would amount to $25 billion-$30 billion per automaker over the life of the contract.  **"That adds $35 to $40 per hour to active labor cost ‚Äî an increase of roughly 60%," the source said. The impact being that automakers would return to the "bankruptcy era" and more than double the labor costs for GM, Ford, and Stellantis versus non-union automakers like Tesla (TSLA).**  When reached for comment, a UAW spokesperson noted the industry source's take misrepresented a few key points.  "The Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor estimates that labor is just 5.1% of the cost of the average vehicle. That's a very important data point to take into account when the automakers claim that our demands will be catastrophic," UAW spokesperson Jim McNeil said.  McNeil also noted that the rising MSRPs of Big Three vehicles have not been driven by labor. "[A recent study] published by the BLS shows that dealer markups have been driving up the costs of new cars, NOT labor costs."  Finally, McNeil pointed to a recent statement made by Fain talking about the costs borne by UAW workers over the past decade and a half.  "Overall, the starting pay for a Big Three worker today is almost $21,000 less than it was in 2007 when adjusted for inflation," the statement said. "UAW members made enormous sacrifices to save the automakers during the Great Recession, but we‚Äôve never been made whole."  A 'good faith' process  For its part, Big Three leadership has been striking more of a conciliatory tone, at least publicly.  GM President Mark Reuss recently told Yahoo Finance that GM is negotiating a deal "that works for everybody in good faith.‚Äù  Meanwhile, Ford Chairman Bill Ford has said that the UAW isn‚Äôt the "enemy" and that he wants to find common ground.  But Stellantis, which just this week saw Fain throw its contract proposal into the trash in another Facebook Live video, said the UAW needs to focus on "reality."  "[The UAW] demands could endanger our ability to make decisions in the future that provide job security for our employees," Stellantis North America COO Mark Stewart said in a statement to employees, according to Reuters. "This is a losing proposition for all of us." Wall Street wary  Wall Street, it seems, is anticipating the worst.  Last week CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson double-downgraded GM to Strong Sell and slashed his price target to $28 from $40. Nelson wrote in a client note, "the growing risk of a UAW strike, given reports that the company and union remain extremely far apart in labor negotiations ... [and] newly-elected UAW President Shawn Fain appears to be aggressive and eager to make his mark with the Detroit Three."  Nelson also said that the last UAW strike in 2019, which lasted 40 days, impacted GM‚Äôs earnings by $1.89 a share.  Morningstar automotive analyst David Whiston echoed those concerns, particularly for GM and Ford, which are more tied to the UAW compared to Stellantis, which has a bigger international labor presence.  "GM and Ford may be in the penalty box for a while. Wall Street hates uncertainty," Whiston said. "This is not a normal negotiation, both in style and the demands they are asking."  "This is a different time," longtime Detroit Free Press automotive writer Eric Lawrence told Yahoo Finance.  **"The union is talking in terms that they probably haven't talked in a long time. They've kind of come out swinging. They've kind of put the automakers on notice, and they've told the workers that they expect to fight for a lot of this contract."**  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-uaw-vs-the-big-three-why-the-unions-wish-list-isnt-going-to-happen-120912769.html,;,; 2023-08-15 06:23:01]

S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. ***** &gt; The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are coming off their fourth straight day of gains, rising nearly 1% and 0.4% on Monday. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, slipped 0.3%. ***** &gt; Markets have been resilient of late, with the major averages rising even when faced by persistent inflation, a banking crisis and higher rates. ***** &gt; This week, the energy market became another potential source of uncertainty, after OPEC+ announced it was slashing output by 1.16 million barrels of oil per day. West Texas Intermediate futures had their biggest daily gain in nearly a year on the news. On Tuesday, crude rose another 1%. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúGiven the transition the world is undergoing as it embraces ‚Äòclean and green energy,‚Äô OPEC+ understands all too well that its still highly valued ‚Äòliquid gold‚Äô will at some point begin to lose its shine,‚Äù said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúUntil then, as the countries dominating OPEC+ prepare for the future by spending trillions of dollars rebuilding infrastructure and refocusing away from crude oil as their primary source of income, managing the price of crude will be used more directly and aggressively than was anticipated,‚Äù she added. ***** &gt; Analysts say the prospect of higher oil prices could stoke inflation and recession fears, but Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, said she doesn‚Äôt expect markets to price in a recession a second time after the ‚Äúpretty severe‚Äù bear market in 2022.

[Dow Jones futures rise; a sale at Silicon Valley Bank closes; Microsoft, Tesla near buy points,;,; Dow Jones futures rose slightly Sunday night, along with S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The bank crisis is still in focus. Headlines have been relatively modest so far this weekend, though a deal may be close for FDIC-controlled Silicon Valley Bank.  A stock market rally attempt is ongoing, but the indexes have been volatile while breadth has been narrow.  The major indexes rose modestly for the week, but came far off weekly highs. The Russell 2000 hit 2023 lows with bank stocks, but small caps and banks edged up for the week.  The rally attempt has relied heavily on big-cap Nasdaq stocks. Apple stock, ¬†Microsoft ($MSFT), Tesla ($TSLA), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals ($REGN), MercadoLibre ($MELI) and Palo Alto Networks ($PANW) are Nasdaq 100 stocks that are holding up well.  REGN stock gapped up into a buy zone late in the week on positive drug trial news. Apple ($AAPL) and Microsoft are just above buy points while Palo Alto is just below an entry. MercadoLibre and Tesla stock are holding key support levels, not far from being actionable. All boast strong relative strength lines. MercadoLibre and PANW stock are on IBD Leaderboard. AAPL stock is on SwingTrader. MSFT stock is on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list. MELI stock is on the IBD 50.   Just because individual stocks are possible buys doesn't mean investors have to act on them. This market rally attempt still needs to confirm its uptrend.   ## Bank News  This weekend has been relatively quiet for banking news, at least in comparison to the prior two weekends. The news generally has been about resolution vs. frantic efforts to avoid systemic collapse.  First Citizens BancShares is in advanced talks to buy SVB Financial's Silicon Valley Bank, Bloomberg reported Sunday evening.  The FDIC has been looking to unload Silicon Valley Bank since taking over more than two weeks ago. Reports last week suggested that the regulator might shoulder some of the underwater assets to smooth the way for a deal.  U.S. regulators could expand an emergency lending facility for banks, with an aim at helping First Republic bolster its balance sheet, Bloomberg reported Saturday, citing sources. Authorities are mulling various options. They don't see any First Republic as needing urgent new help as the California-based bank tries to work out solutions with its advisers.  Late Friday, the Fed reported that deposits at small domestically chartered banks fell by $120 billion in the week March 15, but rose $67 billion at large domestically chartered banks.  On Friday, many banks rebounded from 2023 lows after concerns expanded, at least briefly, to Deutsche Bank. Even Wall Street giants such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley undercut recent lows before closing better.  The video embedded in this article discusses the week's market action in depth, while also analyzing MELI stock as well Meritage Homes and PagerDuty, the two most recent IBD Stock Of The Day selections.

[(4/24) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,;,; # Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, April 24th, 2023-  *****  # [Stock futures fall as Wall Street awaits tech earnings: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/23/stock-futures-inch-down-as-wall-street-awaits-tech-earnings.html) ***** &gt; Stock futures fell on Monday as investors awaited a slew of corporate earnings from big tech companies, as well as fresh economic data releases. ***** &gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 89 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. ***** &gt; The major indexes all fell last week as the earnings season began to ramp up, with several prominent banking names posting their quarterly results for the first time since the bank failures in March. The Dow dropped 0.23% and ended a four-week winning streak. The Nasdaq declined 0.42%, while the S&amp;P edged down 0.1%. ***** &gt; Roughly 76% of S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported earnings through Friday beat analyst earnings estimates, according to FactSet data. However, first-quarter earnings for S&amp;P 500 companies are estimated to decline an overall 5.2%, per Refinitiv. ***** &gt; Wall Street is looking ahead toward mega-cap tech earnings results this week in what will mark the halfway point of earnings season. Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta are among the high-interest names scheduled to announce their results for the first quarter. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúA lot of these companies took 2022 as an opportunity to dump all the bad stuff into their earnings,‚Äù said Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell‚Äù on Friday, regarding upcoming tech earnings. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we see a lot of positive surprises coming out of their earnings reports,‚Äù Damodaran added. ***** &gt; Investors are also keeping a close eye out on new economic data that will provide insight into whether inflation is cooling, or if the Federal Reserve will announce another rate hike at its next meeting in early May. GDP numbers for the first quarter, as well as April‚Äôs consumer sentiment data will be released among a flurry of other economic indicators. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúPart of the reason why we‚Äôre so focused on the economic data is we think the investor narrative is still around the Fed and interest rates. And we think the economic reports over the next seven to 10 days are going to be the really big driver of ultimately what the Fed is going to do,‚Äù said Greg Bassuk, CEO of AXS Investments. ***** &gt; Bassuk continued, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre expecting the data, frankly, to be mixed. And we think that‚Äôs going to continue to cause uncertainty and continued volatility. I think, to some extent, the Fed rate hike slowed down the economy. But there‚Äôs still elements where things are still looking pretty robust. Because of that, we‚Äôre thinking that the Fed is likely to do one more rate cut.‚Äù ***** &gt; Coca-Cola and Credit Suisse are set to report earnings Monday before the bell. Whirlpool and First Republic Bank will be announcing their results after Monday‚Äôs trading session. Traders will also watch out for the Dallas Fed‚Äôs Manufacturing survey results to gauge the state of the state‚Äôs factory activity.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/X80CMcG.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)  *****  #LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2sXCFPp.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oSAmFRT.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/g7rVv6a.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/a4GjFhU.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Ky9YilO.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/vUijTz5.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ldx3ChR.png)**)  *****  #THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**) (N/A.)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/s7NcxRQ.png)**)  *****  #FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/PfOt4BN.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/d6UNrjj.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ZfzSKpV.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Ii3RcFW.png)**)  *****  #FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/C56urpz.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/gKMHb3m.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/24/stocks-making-the-biggest-premarket-moves-ko-fslr-ai-and-more.html)**)  *****  &gt; **Coca-Cola** ‚Äî Shares of the beverage maker added about 1.4% in early morning trading after the company posted better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter, fueled by price hikes and higher demand.

[(6/2) Friday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,;,; #Good Friday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the final trading day of the week. Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news on this Friday, June the 2nd, 2023-  *****  #[Stock futures rise as Wall Street eyes May jobs report, traders cheer debt ceiling bill passing: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)  ***** &gt; Stock futures rose as traders looked ahead to Friday‚Äôs May jobs report and cheered lawmakers passing a debt ceiling bill that averts a U.S. default. ***** &gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 157 points, or 0.5%, while S&amp;P 500 futures added 0.5%. Nasdaq-100 futures rose 0.5%. ***** &gt; Lululemon shares popped 14% in the premarket on strong results and a guidance boost, while MongoDB surged 23% after hours on a blowout forecast. ***** &gt; Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect that growth eased in May over the previous month, with 190,000 jobs added versus the 253,000 gained in April. That would mark the lowest monthly gain since December 2020. ***** &gt; Investors will look through the report for clues on the Federal Reserve‚Äôs futures policy moves. ***** &gt; Easing concerns around the U.S. debt ceiling also helped sentiment. The Senate passed a bill to raise the debt ceiling late Thursday night, sending the bill to President Joe Biden‚Äôs desk. That comes after the House passed the Fiscal Responsibility Act on Wednesday, just days before the June 5 deadline set by U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. ***** &gt; Fear that the U.S. may default on its obligations if lawmakers failed to reach an agreement rattled some investors earlier in the week. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI do think markets were pretty savvy this time: They kind of priced in some sort of resolution, but because we‚Äôre taking a tail risk off the table, we‚Äôre getting a bit of relief here,‚Äù said Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. ***** &gt; Investors may also be finding some solace in the likelihood of very limited economic impact from the recent debt ceiling fiasco and a cap on spending that appears unlikely to weigh on economic growth in a ‚Äúmeaningful way,‚Äù she added. ***** &gt; Stocks kicked off the new trading month on a positive note Thursday. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 0.99% and 1.28%, respectively, to settle at their highest levels since August. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 153.3 points, or 0.47%. ***** &gt; As the week draws to a close, both the S&amp;P and Nasdaq are on track to finish with modest gains of 0.37% and 0.97%. The Dow sits 0.1% lower for the week as of Thursday‚Äôs close.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  # YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/HMrDjnV.png)**)  *****  # TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UQFvpWg.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/FfD8pXT.png)**)  *****  #NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/HmTZiTm.png)**)  *****  #NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/EEM2IAL.png)**)  *****  #NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**) (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*NONE.*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**) (NONE.)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**) (NONE.)  *****  #THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**) (NONE.)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**) (NONE.)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES!](https://i.imgur.com/4aDiEIu.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/tpcSgM0.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/raDMxz5.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/UFbfs7p.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-sentinelone-lululemon-dupont-and-more.html)**)  *****  &gt; **MongoDB** ‚Äî The data developer platform stock surged 27% after the company issued a strong forecast for the second quarter, seeing between $388 million and $392 million in revenue.

[Keep portfolio / Sell portfolio and put all into Term Deposits. What would you do?,;,; Hi guys! I'm looking for some advice / points of view on something. For the last couple of weeks i've been thinking and thinking what i should do with my portfolio / investment strategy. So, I'm from Europe, and i currently have some money invested into the US market + some spare money (I'll show the percentages below). Right know, i have some spare money and i have the possibility to it into some Term deposits with maturity from 1 month, up to 3 years, which i think pays out quite good or just keep DCA into the market.  Ok so first, my portfolio right now is still positive overall and it looks like this: VOO - 25%, QQQ - 18%, NVDA - 12%, AAPL - 11%, MSFT - 10%, GOOGL - 7%, RKLB - 3%, UNH - 3% and the rest 11% split into V, ASTS, MA, HD, AMZN, TGT, DIS, BA and TSLA. For the past year or so, i didn't add anything to individual stocks and just DCA into VOO/QQQ every month.  Now, the banks right now have these interests (i've selected from different banks, the best ones for each maturity period): 1 month - 5.7%, 3 months - 7.3%, 6 months - 7.5%, 1 year - 8.2%, 2 years - 8.45%, 3 years - 8.7%. But before you say holy s\*\*t, these are good returns, right now, here, the inflation rate is at 15% (which in reality i think it's even worse), so it's not that great if you look at it that way.  Looking at the market right now, 7.5% or 8.2% seems pretty good. I know the market average return is around 8% to 9% but I'm not sure the market is gonna have these kind of returns (at least the next few years?). But i could be right, i could be wrong of course. I just don't feel like it's gonna do great next period, that's all.  So now back to my dilemma... As i said, for the past year i just DCA each month into VOO/QQQ. Besides what's already invested, i have some spare cash i would like to deploy right now and i see these scenarios.  \- Sell the portfolio, and put it all + spare money + new money each month into term deposits (6 months or 1 year maturity)  \- Keep portfolio as it is and put spare money + new money each month into term deposits  \- Keep portfolio and put the spare money into it + DCA each month as usual and ignore the term deposits  If i missed something, maybe a better option or some information that i missed and might be really important to take into consideration, please tell me. Right now i'm something like 60/40 into second scenario. Just don't touch the portfolio, but put the rest of the money into these deposits (i was thinking the 1 year one may be the best one ?), until the market stabilizes a bit. Also, im in my twenties, so my investment hold period is long. I don't need the money any time soon (that's 1 of the reason why i think the option to keep DCA into the market may be better because of the compound interest?).  I could really use some advice on this guys. What would you do in this situation? Sorry if some terms are not right or something, as im not from US, some things related to investing may be different and i might wrongly translate them. Thanks a lot guys!  TLDR: You have spare money right now. How you choose to use it? Sell portfolio and put everything into Term deposits (at least for the next couple of years) / Keep portfolio and put rest into Term deposits / Ignore the Term deposits and keep DCA into the market as usual.,;,; 2023-03-13 16:09:59]
[$FLNC - High Growth Battery / Energy Storage Stock Trading At A Low Growth-Based Valuation,;,; # Stock Information  Sector: Energy  Industry: Renewable Energy  Enterprise Value: $2.8B  Market Cap: $3.1B  Total Shares Outstanding: 126.4MM  # Business Overview  Fluence Energy, Inc. is a provider of grid-scale energy storage technology, services, and software, with a leading market share position in battery storage integration. The company was established in January 2018 as a JV between Siemens and AES. Fluence completed its IPO in October 2021 and trades on the NASDAQ under the ticker FLNC.  ***Recent Developments***  * FLNC announced the sale of 18 million shares after market close today under its existing shelf offering. The shares represent the holdings of the controlling stockholders of Fluence, those being AES, Siemens, and the Qatar Investment Authority. * Diablo Energy filed a counterclaim against FLNC for a full refund of $229MM in equipment and services. Fluence‚Äôs original claim was for Diablo‚Äôs failure to comply with the terms of their contract, including payment of the remaining balance owed to Fluence and for other related damages. FLNC issued a statement noting they stand by the work they completed and will stick to their initial claim against Diablo Energy.  # Financials/Estimates  ***FY23 Financials***  * $2.2B Revenue - Historical 3yr CAGR of 48% * ($102MM) EBITDA * ($112MM) Cash From Operations * $346MM Cash * $1.35B Assets * $796MM Liabilities * $556MM Equity * $53.5MM Total Debt * SBC is very low at 1.2% of LTM Rev  ***Ratios/Metrics***  * Margins are mostly negative aside from LTM Gross Profit Margin of 6.4%. Not the biggest deal given a fairly visible trajectory to profitability and growth stock analysis should be more focused on future performance. * Operational leverage and liquidity are satisfactory with a Current Ratio of 1.6x which is improving rapidly over past several years * Cash Burn Risk is moderately low with 12.5 months of capital (even 11 would be o.k. with attainable profitability in near future)  ***Forward Estimates (sourced from TIKR.com)***  * At midpoint, expecting $3B and $3.97B Rev for FY24 and FY25, respectively * Forward 2yr Revenue CAGR of 35% * Recently attained FCF Profitability on a quarterly basis, expecting consistent FCF profitability by 2025 * Near zero debt with 0.2x Debt / Forward EBITDA with no other debt arrangements or obligations  # Valuation (Forward Basis)  * 0.7x EV/S which is abnormally low and boosts revenue based valuation * 11.1x EV/EBITDA is fairly low for a high growth stock but unreliable given its road to profitability is in progress * 3.3% FCF Yield which doesn't meet my personal hurdle rate of 5% (4% for high growth) but I see reasons to compromise  # Upside Risks  ***Secular*** ***Trend*** *- Energy Storage Industry Outlook is Strong -* ***HIGH***  * Evidenced by good backlog (supply chain locked in for FY24 and FY25) and rapidly expanding commercial pipeline. Recent decline in battery prices more than offset FLNC's cost of capital and should help drive strengthening demand and volume for energy storage. * Additionally, customers have easy access to capital despite tightened capital markets  *Industry Stimulus -* ***HIGH***  * FLNC is well positioned to benefit from govt stimulus given the push to renewable energy. Incentives are already in route with an IRA tax benefit for FLNC's Gridstack Pro, a utility-scale energy storage system, one of the first to qualify for tax benefits given the Co's domestic production.  # Downside Risks  *Competition -* ***MODERATELY LOW***  * While this has not impeded FLNC's high growth so far, there are numerous competitors in the energy storage including TSLA, NEE, Toshiba, GE, and others. FLNC's visible growth trajectory and is reason for this to not be a higher degree risk, at least not for the foreseeable future.  *Stock Price Volatility -* ***HIGH***  * Comes with the territory, if the Fed does not pivot as aggressively as expected, FLNC may experience substantial stock price volatility along with all other high growth stocks reaching for profitability.  *Insider Shareholder Concentration -* ***MODERATE***  * AES and Siemens spun off FLNC and own nearly half of all shares. Insider selling may indeed occur and importantly, through Class B share ownership, AES and Siemens have majority control of the company--this does not seem to be a problem so far but is considered a risk nonetheless.  *Legal Dispute -* ***LOW***  * FLNC is currently in a legal dispute with Diablo Energy who is requesting a full refund of $229MM for equipment and services which never occurs in these situations. FLNC was the first to file a claim and may perhaps have the upper hand here. Nonetheless, including as a risk until more details arise.  # Summary  FLNC could be a great high growth play benefitting from a strong secular trend despite economic uncertainty, as evidenced by its recent performance. While I consider the risks acceptable for a small position, I fully intend to DCA into a larger position over the next several months assuming no negative surprises.  My expected timeframe for a position is at least 1-2 years and will reevaluate each quarterly earnings or material event.  I'm selling CSPs ATM and should the options chain open up, will consider OTM LEAP calls. Obviously, open to discussion. Thoughts?,;,; 2023-12-21 16:38:50]
[Tesla just turned a huge financial burden into a $12.9 billion revenue opportunity.,;,; * Tesla recently added two of the world's largest carmakers to its EV charging network. * Just weeks later, more automobile manufacturers are making -- or considering -- the move.  * Some investors are viewing this as an opportunity comparable to Amazon's rollout of AWS.  #  The electric vehicle maker might be having an "AWS moment."  The past couple of years have been a bumpy ride for Tesla (TSLA). After rocketing to an all-time high in late 2021, the stock plunged more than 70% in the face of high inflation, rising interest rates, and the worst stock market downturn in more than a decade. But the tide appears to have turned over the past several months. Since bottoming in early January, Tesla shares have been on fire, gaining 149% as of this writing.   What caused this epic run? A rebound in the stock market and the recovering economy were no doubt contributors, but the biggest gains have come over the past few weeks in the wake of a few historic announcements. Several big-name automakers have ceded the high ground, joining the Tesla Supercharger network and adopting its North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector, which is now on the road to becoming the industry standard on the continent.   This stampede of partnerships prompts the question: Is Tesla having an "AWS moment"?  # The agreements driving Tesla stock higher   Late last month, Ford announced that beginning early next year, Ford electric vehicle (EV) owners would gain access to more than 12,000 Tesla charging stations across the U.S. Ford's chief customer officer, Marin Gjaja, cited Tesla's "large, reliable and efficient charging system" as the incentive.        Just weeks later, General Motors announced that it, too, would join the Tesla Supercharger network. On Tuesday, Rivian jumped on the bandwagon, joining the company's North American network, while Hyundai is considering a similar move.   In each case, the automakers have noted that after initially requiring an adapter, they would equip future EVs with an NACS charge port within the next couple of years, eliminating the need for adapters going forward.  #   The cloud connection   Back in 2000, Amazon (AMZN) was hamstrung by a number of growth-related issues, the biggest being the ability to scale its nascent operations. To address this challenge, the company developed a cloud infrastructure system that would form the foundation for its growing e-commerce business.        At the time -- and unbeknownst to Amazon executives -- the company had planted the seeds that would eventually become Amazon Web Services (AWS), its lucrative cloud computing service. After being used solely by Amazon employees for several years, the service debuted to the public in early 2006, and the company began renting out the cloud infrastructure it originally developed for in-house use. And the rest -- as they say -- is history.         AWS quickly become one of Amazon's most lucrative enterprises, a paradigm that continues to this day. In 2022, AWS generated revenue of more than $80 billion, up 29% year over year. More importantly, the cloud computing business was responsible for just 15% of Amazon's total revenue but all of its operating income -- even subsidizing the losses from its e-commerce operations.   The company is still the leader in the cloud business it pioneered, closing out the first quarter with a 32% share of the cloud infrastructure market, which is as much as the shares of Microsoft and Alphabet combined, according to data supplied by research firm Canalys.         The parallel here is clear. Tesla originally developed the Supercharger network solely for use by its customers, but it appears to be transforming into a lucrative industry standard.  # AWS moment?   The ability to take a substantial business costs and turn them into a hefty revenue generator is a rare thing, which is why some are calling this Tesla's "AWS moment." Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is one such commentator. He notes that while the company is known for accelerating EV adoption around the globe, Tesla's Supercharger network is the hidden gem that will take the company -- and its stock -- to the next level:         I believe "what has changed" for the Street over the last month is the recognition with the Ford and GM supercharger partnerships that Tesla's sum-of-the-parts valuation is now finally starting to get tapped into. This reminds us of when the Street started to realize the margin story and valuation at AWS for Amazon.        He goes on to estimate that the pacts with Ford and GM could add another $3 billion to Tesla's EV charging revenue "over the next few years."        Piper Sandler agrees and is more precise in its estimates, estimating that charging from non-Tesla customers could add $3 billion to revenue by 2030, surging to $5.4 billion by 2032. A greater number of EVs on the road -- from numerous automakers -- will no doubt accelerate this "flywheel effect," enriching Tesla and its shareholders along the way.         The company is also vying for roughly $7.5 million in subsidies offered by the Biden administration to expand its Supercharger network if other automakers have access to its system. In all, this amounts to nearly $13 billion in additional financial incentives for Tesla to open up its network.         It's also worth noting that Tesla also has a significant advantage over its rivals with one of the most cost-effective chargers in the business. The company has been able to construct charging stations for as little as $42,000 per connector, compared to a range of $100,000 to $250,000 for its rivals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tesla can use the additional funds from non-Tesla customers to expand its Supercharger network, further fueling the flywheel.         While it's still early days for these charging collaborations, this could eventually be a big revenue generator for Tesla.  #  The fine print   As previously noted, Tesla's stock price has soared this year -- up nearly 50% in the past month alone -- as a result of the recent announcements, with a commensurate increase in its valuation. The stock currently has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 77 and sells for over eight times forward sales -- a lofty valuation by any measure. For context, analysts expect the company to grow revenue by 22% and 29%, respectively, in 2023 and 2024. Value investors will no doubt balk at the stock's hefty price tag.        That said, Tesla is the undisputed leader in the U.S. EV market and is just beginning to flex its charging station muscles. If the company eventually adopts a similar strategy for batteries and energy storage solutions, Tesla's recent gains could be just the beginning for those with a long-term outlook.    ,;,; 2023-06-26 09:32:17]

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 18th, 2023.  # **Dow, Nasdaq close higher Friday, extending rally to a seventh winning week: Live updates- [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)** ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher Friday after a whipsaw session, where it marked a fresh intraday record, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 closed at a record high, as Wall Street pushed both major indexes to their seventh-straight winning week. ***** &gt; The Dow closed up 56 points, or 0.2%, at 37,305.16. The S&amp;P 500 slipped 36 points, or 0.01%, to 4,719.19 while the Nasdaq Composite closed up 52 points, or 0.4% at 14,813.92. The Nasdaq-100 broke above 16,573.34, a record closing high reached in November 2021. ***** &gt; Shares of Costco ended the day up 4.5% after hitting an all-time high during the session. The retailer surpassed Wall Street‚Äôs estimates for quarterly results and issued a dividend of $15 per share. ***** &gt; Both the 30-stock Dow and the tech-heavy Nasdaq notched their seventh straight positive week. As of Friday, the Dow is higher on the month by 3.7%. The S&amp;P 500 is up by 3.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite has climbed 4.2% so far in December. The S&amp;P 500‚Ä≤s close brought the index just shy of its seventh straight weekly gain, which would have marked its longest winning streak since 2017. The S&amp;P 500 could still soon join the Dow with its own all-time high, however, as the broad market index is less than 2% away from a record close set in January 2022. ***** &gt; Wall Street rallied this week after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday admitted that its efforts to tamp down inflation are taking hold, and indicated three interest rate cuts are coming in 2024, buoying investor sentiment. The November retail sales data that came in stronger than expected on Thursday, following this week‚Äôs cooler inflation readings, added to hopes the Federal Reserve could navigate a soft landing. ***** &gt; That said, New York Fed President John Williams pushed back on the euphoria around the central bank easing rates next year. ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt really talking about rate cuts right now,‚Äù Williams told CNBC‚Äôs Steve Liesman in an interview on Friday. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúStocks got a major sentiment boost from Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting, but that immediate effect was bound to wear off,‚Äù said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E-Trade. ‚ÄúThe market doesn‚Äôt go up every day, no matter how strong a trend is. Pullbacks and pauses are inevitable, regardless of how big they are or how long they last.‚Äù  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/1CKxw09.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ctidu4p.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lB7yYHS.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/bpETcIX.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jU3k5JJ.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/HVT2srn.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/9iQ7H4n.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/uGD4hxG.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bmO9QCX.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PjXHYwd.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/58K9Yx1.png))**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/E0mZekj.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/70UpDSy.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FekAXMN.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ufkLgfJ.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/elt4ibY.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/8i1w5dx.png))**  *****  &gt; # Magnificent Seven Market Cap Round Trip  &gt; At the start of 2022, the seven largest S&amp;P 500 stocks by market cap (which have begun to colloquially be called the Magnificent Seven) possessed a combined market cap of $11.78 trillion. However, severe losses throughout 2022 meant that by the end of the year these stocks were down 47.7% on average. In terms of the combined market cap, that dropped the total down to just $6.9 trillion. In 2023, those same seven stocks have averaged a gain of 106.6%. While not all of these stocks have fully recovered‚Äîfor example, Telsa (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Meta (META) all have lower market caps than at the start of 2022‚Äîthe strong performance this year on the whole has meant the combined market cap has made a round trip. Now back to square one, what‚Äôs next?  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121523-Mag-Seve.png))**  *****  &gt; # All About Dow New Highs  &gt; In the face of many worries, stocks have put together a historic year in ‚Äô23. To top things off, the Dow just hit a fresh new all-time high, its first new high since January 4, 2022.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/blog-1-2.png))**  &gt; **New Highs Happen More Than You Think** Interestingly, this marked the 11th consecutive year that the Dow made a new high, the second longest streak ever! Of course, the previous two calendar years have had a total of only four new highs, but it still counts.  &gt; Since 1900 there have been nearly 1,400 new highs, which actually comes out to 4.5% of all days since 1900 closing at a new all-time high. That is probably much more than most people expect.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/blog-2-2.png))**  &gt; **Stocks Lead the Economy** &gt; Since markets are forward looking, stocks tend to lead the economy. This can work on the way up and way down, so for us new highs right now is suggesting the economy is on firm footing heading into ‚Äô24 and a stronger economy (with no recession) could be the play next year.  &gt; Sure, there are always some examples of that ‚Äòfinal new high‚Äô right before trouble (1929, 2000, and 2007), but looking back at history, new highs rarely suggest impending doom right around the corner.  &gt; Since World War II, there were 227 months that saw at least one new high for the Dow. A recession started within a year of one of those months only 26 times, or 11.5% of the time. Compare this with the economy being in a recession 13.9% of the time since WWII and new highs could be a subtle positive sign for the economy next year.  &gt; The last new high for the Dow was nearly two years ago, so what happens after the Dow goes a long time without new high? I found 12 times since WWII it went at least a full year without a new high and then made one, and only twice did the economy fall into a recession within a year of that new high.  &gt; What stood out about those two times was both saw Middle East turmoil and a spike in crude oil, likely contributing to the recession. Given the US now produces more oil than anyone, does it makes sense to bet against history and treat this new high as an exception? Here‚Äôs a tweet I sent on this idea.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/blog-3-2.png))**  &gt; **Now What?** &gt; Plain and simple, new highs aren‚Äôt bearish events. In fact, you tend to see new highs take place during bull markets, with more advances potentially ahead. We‚Äôve been calling this a new bull market for over a year now. As far back as last November we said the lows were in and there would be no recession in 2023 (with many arguing with us the whole way up).  &gt; In fact, here‚Äôs an interview I did six months ago with Scott Wapner on CNBC‚Äôs Closing Bell. When he asked me what my biggest worry was, I said it was that too many people were bearish and weren‚Äôt embracing this bull market.  &gt; So what do new highs mean by the numbers? By itself, a new high doesn‚Äôt appear to signal any warnings. In fact, things look about average after new highs. There are the nearly 1,400 new highs since 1900 and a year later the Dow was up 7.8% on average and higher 70.2% of the time. Compare this with the average year since 1900, which was up 7.4% on average and higher 65% of the time.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/blog-4-3.png))**  &gt; But the Dow‚Äôs long break without a new high until now improves the outlook historically. Looking at those 12 times (since WWII) the Dow went at least one year without a new high and then finally made one, ol‚Äô Papa Dow was higher a year later 10 times and up an average of 14.1% with a very solid median return of 16.4%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/blog-5.jpg))**  *****  &gt; # Wealth Effect Picks Up Into Christmas  &gt; With just two weekends left to shop before Christmas, US consumers have to be feeling a little more flush than they were just a couple months ago. Back in October, the stock market was in a 10%+ drawdown and interest rates looked like they might never stop going up. Less than two months later, though, the S&amp;P 500 Total Return index is suddenly trading at all-time highs as Treasury yields have plummeted.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/totalreturn1215.png))**  &gt; Maybe just as important for that "wealth effect" feeling is the huge drop in gas prices that we've seen since late September. Back on September 17th, AAA's national average gas price reading (the cost of a gallon of regular unleaded) hit a 52-week high of $3.88. In the three months since then, there has hardly been a day when gas prices haven't gone down, and just yesterday the price/gallon ticked down to $3.087. That drop took gas prices below the low of $3.096 seen last December 22nd to their lowest levels in more than two and a half years dating back to 6/24/21.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/gallongas.png))**  &gt; With the stock market at new highs again and gas prices suddenly approaching a "2-handle," Santa may have a little more room in his gift sack this year!  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/santgabag.png))**  *****  &gt; # FAANG+ Leaving Newcomers in the Dust  &gt; Both the NYSE FAANG+ Index and Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) have put in place fresh 52-week highs in the past couple of days, however, zooming out, those fresh highs are on different planets. The NYSE FAANG+ index‚Äîcomprised of many mega cap Tech stocks‚Äîis not only at a 52-week high, but it's trading at record highs. Since the pre-COVID market high in February 2020, the FANG+ group is now up 120.1%. As for the IPO ETF, this week's 52-week high only leaves the group at the highest levels since April 2022. Contrary to the all-time high for FAANG+, IPO is still down 51.7% from its February 2021 high and is up a meager 4.7% since pre-COVID. As you can see below, these two traded closely inline with each other in the early days of the post-COVID rally, but FANG+ has left IPO in the dust since the start of 2022.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121523-FANG-vs-IPO.png))**  *****  &gt; # Bulls Take the Majority  &gt; More and more equity indices are hitting fresh record highs with the S&amp;P 500 within 1.5% of doing the same. Understandably on these moves, investor sentiment has gotten a further boost. Per the latest AAII Investor Sentiment Survey, 51.3% of investors reported as bullish this week. And keep in mind, due to the timing of the survey, that would not have fully captured any investor response to yesterday's FOMC. That is the highest and first reading above 50% since July 20th of this year when bulls were only 0.1 percentage points higher. Outside of that week, it would be the highest bullish sentiment reading since April 2022.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-AAII-1.png))**  &gt; Given the new high in bulls, bears have been nowhere to be found. A meager 19.3% of respondents reported as bearish this week. That surpasses the recent low of 19.6% from just two weeks ago for the lowest amount since the first week of January 2018 when only 15.56% of responses were bearish.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-AAII-2.png))**  &gt; The overwhelmingly bullish sentiment can also be observed through the bull-bear spread. Currently, the share of bulls outnumber bears by 32 percentage points. That is the widest margin in favor of bulls since April 2021. Looked at another way, that is 2.1 standard deviations above the historical average of the spread meaning sentiment is extremely extended..  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-AAII-3.png))**  &gt; The cheery sentiment on the part of investors certainly means there is a warm and fuzzy feeling during this holiday season, but we would note that sentiment is historically a contrarian indicator. In other words, opposite to what investors are feeling, extremely bullish sentiment readings have historically been followed by more lackluster returns.  *****  &gt; # Claims Cooling Down  &gt; Economic data this morning broadly came in healthier than expected, including weekly jobless claims. Initial claims were expected to go unchanged at 220K. While that previous week's reading was revised up to 221K, this week's print fell all the way down to 202K. That is the lowest reading on jobless claims since the week of October 14th and September 16th before that. In all, that makes for one of the lowest readings on claims since January of last year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-Claims-1.png))**  &gt; Before seasonal adjustment, claims are largely following the usual seasonal pattern having been trending higher since the early fall. Currently at 248.3K, unadjusted claims are running at the lowest level for the comparable week of the year since 1969.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-Claims-2.png))**  &gt; Continuing claims have gotten much more elevated than initial claims over the past few months. Currently totaling 1.876 million, continuing claims have risen meaningfully from the low of 1.658 million put in place just three months ago. However, the consistent pace of increases over that span (every week from September 16th through the first week of November saw a week over week increase) has slowed, having been more choppy in the past month. In fact, at 1.876 million, the current reading is still almost 50K below the recent high of 1.925 million set in mid-November.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-Claims-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # Moderating Inflation &amp; Final Fed Meeting Clear Path for late-December Surge  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ef864c3f84106395bbfd2b61bd54035c/858694959f22126f-96/s500x750/a55689a0153a6b79ad518fa46fcda7cf02675b2f.jpg))**  &gt; This week‚Äôs CPI and PPI releases showed the moderating trend of inflation continues. Prices are still rising just at a slower pace and the rate of change could finally fall back before the Fed‚Äôs target of 2% next year. In response to and in anticipation of lower interest rates, the market has enjoyed above average gains in December.  &gt; As of the close on December 12, DJIA was up 1.74%, S&amp;P 500 +1.66%, NASDAQ +2.16% and Russell 2000 up an impressive 3.99% (right side vertical axis of chart above). The market did experience some typical early December weakness this year after bucking the trend of weakness on the first trading day. Even though the market has already enjoyed above average gains this month, we still anticipate more to come with the potential for a new all-time closing high from DJIA before year end.  *****  &gt; # Inflation Still Moving in the Right Direction  &gt; This morning‚Äôs Consumer Price Index for November was mostly in line with expectations (although the headline reading was slightly higher than expected), and the lack of any meaningful surprises has allowed the market to continue with what has lately been the path of least resistance, which has been higher. The report also showed that the most rapid leg of disinflation is most likely behind us, and while that could lead some to believe that the road ahead will be a slog, that isn‚Äôt necessarily the case.  &gt; For starters, the focus of monthly inflation reports lately has been in Core CPI (ex-food and energy). After peaking at 6.6% in June 2022, the November year/year reading came in at 4.0% for the second month in a row.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-Core-CPI.png))**  &gt; The chart below shows the historical 12-month rate of change in the y/y core CPI. Over the last 12 months, that rate of increase has declined by two full percentage points, and outside of the prior two months, that is one of the sharpest declines since the early 1980s. In other words, the 12-month rate of change is still declining, but the pace of decline is slowing.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-Core-CPI-One-Year-Change.png))**  &gt; November‚Äôs streak also ended what has been a monumental streak of monthly declines in the y/y core CPI reading. At seven months in October, it was the second longest streak on record, trailing only the ten-month streak of declines ending in December 1975.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-Core-CPI-Declines-Streaks.png))**  &gt; Understandably, the end of the streak of declines along with the slowing rate of decline in the y/y core CPI reading could lead one to think that inflation levels are plateauing at a higher level. However, a look at the trend of monthly prints in core CPI shows a potential tailwind in the months ahead. The chart below shows the monthly change in core CPI over the last 24 months. While it hasn‚Äôt exactly been linear, the trend is lower. In the twelve months from December 2021 through November 2022, eight out of twelve monthly prints were 0.5% or above, but in the last twelve months, only one print has been 0.5%.  &gt; Just looking at the last year (shaded area in chart) it‚Äôs a similar trend. From December 2022 through May 2022, every monthly print was 0.4% or above, but in the most recent six months, every print has been 0.3% or below. If just the trend of the last six months remains in place, for the next six months the y/y reading will be replacing monthly prints of 0.4% or more with prints of 0.3% or less which should help to keep the trend of disinflation going.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-Core-CPI-Monthly-Change.png))**  *****  &gt; # Small Business Sentiment Mixed Under the Hood  &gt; The NFIB unveiled its latest look at small business sentiment early this morning. The headline number remains in the bottom decile of its historical range, falling 0.1 points to 90.6 in November. That is compared to expectations which called for the number to be unchanged last month.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-1.png))**  &gt; Across the categories factoring into the index, breadth was mixed in November with four categories falling, four rising, and one unchanged. Like the headline number, many categories are also in the bottom few percentiles of their respective historical ranges, albeit with some exceptions like robust readings in plans to increase employment, current inventories, and job openings hard to fill.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-2.png))**  &gt; As we discussed in our Morning Lineup, combining the report's readings on employment shows some rebounding conditions for labor markets over the past few months. Looking more closely, though, it is hard to say labor market conditions are materially accelerating. As shown, hiring plans have risen, but on net more companies are reporting negative employment changes. In a similar vein, compensation plans have risen sharply including a six point jump month over month in November (the largest one month increase since last October and the third largest on record), even though actual changes to compensation have been flat. Meanwhile, fewer businesses are reporting job openings are hard to fill. Small businesses are showing labor conditions have cooled over the past couple of years but are far from weak as any more recent improvements have been from plans rather than observed changes.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-4.png))**  &gt; Similarly, sales expectations rebounded in November, contrary to a flat reading on actual sales and earnings changes. Perhaps most importantly, the share of businesses reporting higher prices has fallen down to 25, matching the July low. In combination with the higher reading on sales expectations, that likely helped the number of firms reporting now as a good time to expand.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-5.png))**  &gt; Looking at the reverse, of those reporting now as not a good time to expand, the single biggest reason given for such sentiment was economic conditions. That is typically the most widely cited reason historically followed by political climate (the NFIB has a tendency to be sensitive to politics, namely which party holds the presidency), but for the first time in at least a decade, financial conditions and interest rates earned the number two spot. As shown below, the number of firms reporting that rates are holding them back from expanding has risen steadily since the current tightening cycle began.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-6b.png))**  &gt; As mentioned previously, actual earnings changes saw no improvement in November and are sitting near historically weak levels. As for the reasons given for lower earnings, increased costs remain a key reason, but November also saw a significant jump in those reporting sales volumes as a problem. In other words, inflation and weaker demand appear to be weighing on small business earnings.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-5a.png))**  &gt; Despite the burden of interest rates and expectations for credit conditions sitting at the lowest levels in over a decade, small businesses have actually increased capital expenditures dramatically to a new post-pandemic high. However, that is counter to capital expenditure plans, which have fallen in the past few months, and inventories showing drawdowns.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-6.png))**  *****  Here is the full list of companies report earnings for this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 12.18.23 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) (NONE.)  &gt; # ***Monday 12.18.23 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/G9kJkCv.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 12.19.23 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wuAEw5Q.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 12.19.23 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fSjaZjQ.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 12.20.23 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JNndzTW.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 12.20.23 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SJnw3ft.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 12.21.23 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/N7CUSm7.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 12.21.23 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XlSxDrb.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 12.22.23 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]()) (NONE.)  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 12.22.23 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) (NONE.)  *****  # DISCUSS!

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 17th, 2023,;,; Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 17th, 2023.  # **Dow sheds more than 100 points Friday, but notches fourth straight positive week: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/13/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)** ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Friday, but was headed for a positive week, as investors assessed a weak retail sales report that dented enthusiasm around a stronger-than-expected start to corporate earnings. ***** &gt; The 30-stock Dow dropped 143.22 points, or about 0.42%, to 33,886.47. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.21% to 4,137.64. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.35% to 12,123.47. ***** &gt; The Dow, however, notched its fourth-straight positive week, rising 1.2%. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq, meanwhile, nabbed their fourth positive week in five. The broad-market index added 0.79% for the week, while the Nasdaq ticked higher by 0.29%. ***** &gt; Advance retail sales in March showed consumer spending fell twice as much as expected. Retail sales declined by 1% last month, more than the 0.5% drop expected by economists polled by Dow Jones, in part because consumers paid less for fuel. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúRetail sales came in weaker than expected, but a lot of the miss had to do with lower gas prices, which all things being equal is a slight positive for spending,‚Äù wrote Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúInflation has been coming down as gas prices have been coming down, but that can reverse in an instant, which would drive the headline numbers higher. What is more concerning is that core (which excludes food and gas prices) has been stubbornly high ‚Äì and where we believe the risks to higher-rates-for-longer lie,‚Äù Zaccarelli added. ***** &gt; The disappointing retail sales data offset excitement around strong corporate earnings. JPMorgan Chase reported record revenue that beat analysts‚Äô expectations, with the stock rising more than 7%. Wells Fargo shares briefly rose as much as 2.1% after the bank reported growing profits, before closing about flat. These were the first bank earnings since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank last month. ***** &gt; Elsewhere, UnitedHealth, which has the biggest weighting in the Dow, fell 2.7% after what Mizuho described as a ‚Äúmodest beat and raise.‚Äù The action came after UnitedHealth said it‚Äôs spending more for new diabetes and weight loss drugs from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. ***** &gt; Meanwhile, Boeing closed lower by more than 5%. On Thursday, the aircraft maker warned of delivery delays for some of its 737 Max planes. ***** &gt; Expectations for this earnings season are downbeat. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expect S&amp;P 500 earnings fell more than 5% in the first quarter. That forecast comes as companies deal with persistent inflation and higher rates. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe bar has never been set lower,‚Äù said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. ‚ÄúMy guess is with consensus expectations for the S&amp;P 500 to show earnings that are down some 5%, that may well be overstating what we actually find out.‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think that what‚Äôs going to be super important is the kind of guidance we get, and how confident that corporations will be in guiding for the next three quarters in the face of what likely will be a slower economy.‚Äù ***** &gt; Investors also assessed two back-to-back reports this week signaling cooling inflation. The March producer price index, a measure of prices paid by companies, declined 0.5% from the prior month, even as economists polled by Dow Jones expected prices to stay the same. Excluding food and energy, the index shed 0.1% from the prior month, while economists estimated a 0.2% month-to-month increase. ***** &gt; The PPI, which is considered a leading indicator of consumer inflation, bolstered a trend of easing inflation seen in the March consumer price index report released Wednesday. Consumer prices grew 5% on an annual basis, which was the smallest year-over-year increase in nearly two years.  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/n2ZQBWZ.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/BcdUMFM.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/mkb9CFv.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/hIDoNrq.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/MiTldYm.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EXWxSe5.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/31m7Pxt.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fDJiCJO.png))**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/EYHOLQm.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/UOldVVO.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PqvO44Q.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4AFQCkk.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/i1VZx3g.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/t08jwb1.png))**   *****  &gt; # Three More Bullish Signals The Bears Don‚Äôt Want To See  &gt; ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt know where you want to get to‚Ä¶.it doesn‚Äôt matter which way you go.‚Äù -The Cheshire Cat to Alice in Alice in Wonderland.  &gt; Stocks have continued to stage an impressive rally off the mid-March lows, so much so that we have now seen multiple rare and potentially bullish signals trigger. Today, I‚Äôll take a look at three of these signals. Yes, by itself any one of these signals could be noise, but when you start stacking them on top of each other, like the Cheshire Cat said in the quote above, stocks likely want to go higher and we should be ready to know where they could head.  &gt; First up, the S&amp;P 500 had it‚Äôs best first quarter since 2019, up 7.0%, which came on the heels of 7.1% gain the quarter before. What happened after previous big first quarters? I found there were 16 other first quarters that gained at least 5% and the final three quarters of the year finished higher 15 times. Yes, the one year that didn‚Äôt work was 1987 and when people hear that year, they start to get worried. Well, stocks were up 40% for the year in August back then, so we‚Äôll worry about having another 1987 if we see returns like that (which we don‚Äôt expect). Until then, this is another clue the bulls could have a nice 2023.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-1-800x564.png))**  &gt; Next, we‚Äôve heard a lot how only a few stocks are leading the overall markets higher. We don‚Äôt fully agree there and one way to show this is there was a recent sign of extreme buying pressure across many sectors and stocks. Using data from our friends at Ned Davis Research, more than 93% of the stocks in the NDR universe were recently above their 10-day moving average. All you need to know here is this is a rare sign of broad-based strength and a year later stocks were higher 23 out of 24 times with some very solid returns along the way.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-2-800x338.png))**  &gt; Lastly, Marty Zweig is known as one of the best traders ever and he coined the Zweig Breadth Thrust (ZBT) indicator many years ago. Well, we just saw a rare trigger of this potentially bullish signal. To keep it simple, this signal looks at all the stocks on the NYSE and it looks for periods of extreme oversold periods moving to periods of extremely overbought in a short timeframe. Think of it as a washout and then heavy buying coming in, which tends to open the door to higher prices.  &gt; The table below shows the previous 14 ZBTs and what happened next. Wouldn‚Äôt you know it, but the S&amp;P 500 was higher a year later every single time. That is 14 out of 14 and up 23.3% on average. Sure, the sample size isn‚Äôt probably as large as we‚Äôd like to consider this statistically relevant, but I‚Äôd sure rather know this than ignore it.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-3-800x755.png))**  &gt; Finally, here‚Äôs a chart showing the ZBTs. Sometimes a picture tells the story and one look at this, and it would be quite rare for this signal to trigger and for stocks to simply drop right back to new lows. In fact, usually it happens ahead of periods of strength.  *****  &gt; # First Republic and Other Banks See Large Jumps in Short Interest  &gt; Short interest figures get published every two weeks, and movements in short interest are a helpful way to gauge bull/bear positioning on individual names as well as groups and sectors. When a stock has a high percentage of shares sold short, it means that a lot of investors are betting against it. If a highly-shorted company manages to produce better than expected results, however, shares will often see outsized gains as many of those shorts rush to cover.  &gt; With bank failures and deposit flight emerging in March, causing two S&amp;P 500 bank stocks to fail and many other regional bank stocks to fall precipitously, we were interested to see how short interest levels changed during the month. End-of-month short interest figures for March were just recently published, and below is a table showing stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 that saw the biggest increases in short interest as a percentage of float (SIPF) during the month.  &gt; As shown, the two stocks that saw the biggest increases in short interest were First Republic Bank (FRC) and PacWest Bancorp (PACW). At the end of February, FRC only had 2.71% of its float sold short, but by the end of March, that figure had spiked to 29.51%. PacWest's jump in short interest was slightly less extreme, but it was extreme nonetheless, rising from 3.59% up to 20.56% in March. Another nine Financials are on the list of the 30 S&amp;P 1500 stocks that saw the biggest jumps in SIPF in March, while another five REITs made the list as well.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/changesipf.png))**  &gt; Below is a better look at just how much short interest spiked for First Republic (FRC) in March. While the bank did see a mini-spike in late 2018 when the broader market was struggling with another batch of Fed tightening, FRC's short interest normally sits between 0-5% of float. Now it's up to nearly 30%. For a stock that's down 94% from its highs, where do you think the risk/reward lies at this point?  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/frcfloat.png))**  &gt; In terms of the most heavily shorted stocks, only Big Lots (BIG) currently has a higher percentage of its float sold short than FRC in the S&amp;P 1500.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/sp1500short.png))**  &gt; Below is a chart showing the average change in SIPF for stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 by industry group in the month of March. As shown, the Banks saw the biggest average jump at 0.78 ppts, followed by Telecom Services, Media &amp; Entertainment, and REITs. Stocks in the Consumer Durables &amp; Apparel group saw the largest decline in SIPF at -0.23 ppts.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/floatchange.png))**  *****  &gt; # Sentiment: Back to the 20s  &gt; Whereas last week saw a huge rebound in bullish sentiment after the S&amp;P 500's breakout above March highs, the more listless price action of the past week resulted in a modest turnaround in sentiment. The latest AAII sentiment survey showed only 26.1% of respondents reported as bullish compared to the recent high of 33.3% last week. The 7.2 percentage point decline was the largest one-week drop in bulls since the last week of February when it declined by 12.5 percentage points. That leaves bullish sentiment right in the middle of the range since the start of 2022.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041323-AAII-1.png))**  &gt; Although bullish sentiment fell, without any considerable push lower for the S&amp;P 500, bearish sentiment went little changed falling just half of one percentage point down to 34.5%. Like last week, that remains the lowest reading since the week of February 16th.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041323-AAII-2.png))**  &gt; That means that all of the declines in bullish and bearish sentiment flowed to the neutral camp with a surge of 7.9 percentage points; the largest one-week increase since the first week of the year. At 39.5%, neutral sentiment is at the high end of the past few years' range and only 0.3 percentage points below the late February high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041323-AAII-4.png))**  &gt; The AAII survey was not the only sentiment reading to take a more bearish tone this week. The NAAIM Exposure index's latest release today showed investment managers reduced equity exposure. Meanwhile, the Investors Intelligence survey's bull-bear spread has actually continued to rise resulting in the highest reading since the first week of 2022. Additionally, as we noted in Monday's Chart of the Day, the TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index went unchanged in March after rebounding in the proceeding few months. In other words, across multiple readings, sentiment has improved but has yet to definitively shift to bullish.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041323-AAII-5.png))**  *****  &gt; # The Good, The Bad, The Inflation  &gt; The March inflation report showed that CPI inflation rose only 0.1%, slightly below expectations. Over the past year, inflation is now up 5%, well off the peak 9% from June 2022. As you can see below, the big driver of lower inflation has been energy and food.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-13-headline-CPI-662x800.png))**  &gt; Energy makes up about 7% of the ‚Äúinflation basket‚Äù, split almost equally into commodities (like gasoline) and services (like electricity and piped gas). Thanks to the pullback in oil prices, energy commodity prices are now below where they were in December 2021. The recent drop in natural gas prices has also sent services prices lower over the past couple of months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-13-energy-prices-800x660.png))**  &gt; Further good news: prices for ‚Äúfood at home‚Äù, i.e. groceries, fell 0.3% in March. This is the first price decline since September 2020, and bodes well even for prices and restaurants and such (which are still elevated).  &gt; # Lower energy and food prices are a big deal, for consumption &gt; Lower inflation, by way of lower energy and food prices, means ‚Äúreal‚Äù incomes, i.e. incomes adjusted for inflation, remain strong. More so if the labor market remains healthy, which looks to be the case as we wrote the other day.  &gt; The chart below shows annualized growth rates of disposable income, employee compensation (across all workers in the economy), and inflation. Over the past 3, 6 and 12 months, disposable income has run ahead of inflation. Part of this is because social security incomes got a big inflation-adjusted boost in January. But even employee compensation is running ahead of inflation. That‚Äôs really positive for consumer spending, which makes up 70% of the economy.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-13-DPI-vs-comp-vs-inflation-602x800.png))**  &gt; # The big story: Housing inflation may finally be turning (lower) &gt; Core inflation, excluding food and energy, rose 0.4% in March. Over the past 3 months, core inflation is up 5.1% (annualized pace) and its up 5.6% over the past year. So, not much of a slowdown.  &gt; Part of the reason is that housing inflation has been running high.  &gt; But we got very good news on that front. Rents of primary residences and owners‚Äô equivalent rent (rental equivalent of owner-occupied homes) rose ‚Äúonly‚Äù 0.5%. While still high, that pace is the slowest monthly increase in a year. Over the past 9 months, housing inflation averaged about +0.7% per month, which translates to a whopping 9% annualized rate!  &gt; So, the slowdown in March is significant, and most welcome.  &gt; Of course, as we‚Äôve written about in the past, we‚Äôve already seen a sharp deceleration in market rents. It‚Äôs just that the official inflation data has been really slow to catch up to that reality. But that may be changing now and bodes well for core inflation to slow down across the rest of this year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-13-rents-market-vs-official-599x800.png))**  &gt; # The bad news: Core inflation ex housing remains elevated &gt; That was the good news, i.e. a slowdown in energy, food and housing inflation. However, the rest of it still looks to be elevated.  &gt; For one thing, vehicle prices are no longer falling as fast as they were. Vehicle prices, especially for used cars, was another big factor in pulling inflation lower over the last few months. Used car prices fell 0.9% in March, but that‚Äôs the smallest decline in 7 months. Private data suggests that used car prices are rising again. New vehicle prices also rose 0.4%, breaking a recent downward trend.  &gt; Outside of vehicles, a lot of goods and services that were initially hit by the pandemic are still seeing significant price increases. These include goods like household furnishings and apparel, and services like hotels and airlines fares.  &gt; Even beyond that, services such as day care, personal care, and recreation, are seeing inflation running well above what we saw before the pandemic.  &gt; All of which is a sign that demand for these goods and services remains strong.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Blog-2023-04-13-supercore-select-items-inflation-601x800.png))**  &gt; # What does this mean for the Fed? &gt; Fed officials have explicitly said that they want to see core services ex housing decelerate. In short, they‚Äôre looking at inflation excluding energy, food and housing, the three categories where we‚Äôve had positive news. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs not much evidence that this slice of the inflation basket is decelerating, yet. The good news is that it tends to be correlated to wage growth, and there‚Äôs strong evidence that wage growth is moving closer to what we saw pre-pandemic.  &gt; Now, the Fed is unlikely to continue raising interest rates much further from here, especially since we had a banking crisis, and they may want to play cautious. Plus, as we wrote a few weeks ago, banks tightening credit in response to the crisis is akin to rate increases.  &gt; At the same time, they are likely to keep rates where they are until they see convincing evidence of inflation falling, especially core services ex housing inflation.  &gt; This is not what investors expect. Instead, investors expect the Fed to start cutting rates in late summer, pricing in at least 3 rate cuts by the end of 2023. Indicating that bond investors believe a crisis or recession is likely in the near-term. That‚Äôs clearly not where Fed officials are right now. We‚Äôre not there either, for now.  &gt; Eventually, market pricing and Fed officials‚Äô views must converge. In the meantime, expect volatility, especially in the bond market.  *****  &gt; # 10-Year 10-Baggers  &gt; Peter Lynch's 1989 book One Up On Wall Street introduced investors to the word "ten bagger," which represents an investment that appreciates by 10x (1,000%) its initial purchase price.  &gt; Today we wanted to highlight the stocks that have been "ten baggers" over the last ten years. In the Russell 1,000, 33 names are up more than 1,000% since April 12th, 2013. Over the same 10-year period, the S&amp;P 500 tracking ETF (SPY) is up 211%. As shown below, NVIDIA (NVDA) is up the most with a gain of 8,833%, followed by Tesla (TSLA) at 6,304% and then Plug Power (PLUG) at 5,477%.  &gt; There are 16 Technology stocks on the list of 33 ten baggers, which is the most of any sector. Other Tech stocks on the list include AMD, Enphase Energy (ENPH), Broadcom (AVGO), Fortinet (FTNT), Lam Research (LRCX), and even the two largest stocks in the US - Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT). Netflix (NFLX) is also another notable on the list with a gain of 1,266%.  &gt; Some other notables include Industrials stocks like Axon -- the maker of Tasers and police body cameras, Industrials stocks like Builders FirstSource (BLDR) and Old Dominion Freight (ODFL), and Vince VcMahon's World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which is set to be bought by Endeavor Group (EDR).  &gt; Stocks that are already up 1,000%+ over the last ten years seem unlikely to repeat that over the next ten years. The obvious next question is: which stocks will be ten baggers over the next ten years? As Peter Lynch instructed, you'll have to do your research!  *****  &gt; # 3 Small Business Outlook Cratering  &gt;  Small business optimism continued to decline in March with the headline index from the NFIB falling from 90.9 down to 90.1. That headline reading was actually better than the consensus forecast of 89.3, but it was still in the bottom decile of the indicator's historical range dating back to 1986.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB.png))**  &gt; Looking across individual categories, breadth was weak in the report with only three indices moving higher month over month, three going unchanged, and all the others falling. As with the headline number, many categories are also historically depressed in the bottom decile of readings including a record low.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-2.png))**  &gt; That record low was in the percentage of respondents reporting now as a good time to expand. Only 2% reported now as a good time to expand, down 4 points month over month. Albeit the reading has been at the low end of its historical range for much of the past year, March's reading matched the historical low form March 2009.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-4.png))**  &gt; Given the small business outlook for the economy has soured, fewer firms are reporting plans to increase hiring or capital expenditures. In fact, the index for capex plans fell to 20, which alongside March 2021, is the lowest reading since the spring of 2020. Similarly, hiring plans are at new lows for the post-pandemic period.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-3.png))**  &gt; One factor likely impacting business plans has been financial conditions. The most pronounced decline of any category last month was a record 4-point decline in the availability of loans. While the reading has been rolling over for some time, that drop leaves the index at the lowest level since December 2012.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-4b.png))**  *****  &gt; # Inflation Concerns Continue to Ease  &gt; In an earlier post, we mentioned the record-low reading in the percentage of small businesses perceiving now as a good time to expand. As for what these firms perceive to be their most pressing issues, inflation continues to be the single most prevalent answer at 24%, albeit the gap has narrowed dramatically. Quality of labor is now only a single percentage point behind at 23%, and when combined with cost of labor, the two issues account for over a third of small businesses' biggest problems. From a historical standpoint, those three readings all remain elevated and account for a massive share of the most pressing issues facing small businesses.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-MIP-1.png))**  &gt; The four percentage point drop month over month in the percentage of respondents reporting inflation as their biggest issue is the largest decline since January when it had fallen 6 percentage points. As a result, the category is only down to the lowest level since January 2022 which remains well outside the range of pre-pandemic readings. In other words, inflation appears to be improving compared to last July when it was top of mind for 37% of small businesses, but it is still nowhere near a non-issue.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-MIP-3.png))**  &gt; Picking up some of those losses has been government-related concerns. This series has historically held a political bias in which under Republican administrations small businesses are less concerned with red tape and taxes and vice versa during Democratic administrations. With the surge in inflation concerns during President Biden's tenure, this index has remained historically low but has begun to rise more recently as inflation has improved.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-MIP-2.png))**  &gt; Another area to see a rise in firms reporting it as their biggest problem has been poor sales. While the reading is far from flying, it has begun trending higher accounting for 5% of responses in March. That pairs with the index for actual reported sales changes which have remained firmly negative for nearly a year now.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041123-NFIB-MIP-4.png))**  *****  &gt; # 2023 Still Tracking Pre-Election Year Pattern But Gains May Be Muted  &gt; Despite the recent selloff and volatility S&amp;P 500 still tracks typical pre-election year market trends. However, uncertainties about rates, inflation, recession, banking and economic growth are likely to mute the usual pre-election year gains. A debt ceiling standoff could keep stocks under pressure during the Worst Six Months May-October.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8b5eb76422f363799c6f460598ba7f0c/9f5ad1c8a349c0fb-e0/s500x750/81f91de44d0817e2c092b3c38cf6e29d7bf66ed9.jpg))**  *****  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; (*T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.*)  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/UOldVVO.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/IPjwFtn.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/8FY6cho.png))**  *****  &gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).  &gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))  *****  # DISCUSS!

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023,;,; Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023.  # **Stocks close higher Friday as investors try to shake off latest bank fears: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/stock-futures-are-up-slightly-as-investors-weigh-bank-troubles-fed-decision.html)** ***** &gt; Stocks rose Friday, reversing their earlier session declines as Deutsche Bank shares pared back some losses. ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 132.28 points, or 0.41%, closing at 32,238.15. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.57%, while Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.3%. The major indexes all had a winning week, with the Dow gaining 0.4% week-to-date as of Friday afternoon, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq gained 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively. ***** &gt; Deutsche Bank‚Äôs U.S.-listed shares slid 3.11% Friday, rebounding from a 7% drop earlier in the trading session. A selloff of shares was triggered after the the German lender‚Äôs credit default swaps jumped, but without an apparent catalyst. The move appeared to raise concerns once again over the health of the European banking industry. Earlier this month, Swiss regulators forced a UBS acquisition of rival Credit Suisse. Deutsche Bank shares traded off their worst levels of the session, which caused major U.S. indexes to also cut their losses. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think that the market overall is neither frightened nor optimistic ‚Äî it‚Äôs simply confused,‚Äù said George Ball, president at Sanders Morris Harris. ‚ÄúThe price action for the last month-and-a-half, including today, is a jumble without any direction or conviction.‚Äù ***** &gt; Ball added that Deutsche Bank is ‚Äúvery sound financially.‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIt could be crippled if there‚Äôs a big loss of confidence and there‚Äôs a run on the bank. There is, however, no fundamental reason why that should occur, other than nervousness.‚Äù ***** &gt; European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde tried to ease concerns, saying euro zone banks are resilient with strong capital and liquidity positions. Lagarde said the ECB could provide liquidity if needed. ***** &gt; Investors continued to assess the Fed‚Äôs latest policy move announced this week. The central bank hiked rates by a quarter-point. However, it also hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be ending soon. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that credit conditions have tightened, which could put pressure on the economy. ***** &gt; On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said regulators are prepared to take more action if needed to stabilize U.S. banks. Her comments are the latest among regulators attempting to buoy confidence in the U.S. banking system in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank closures. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúRetail [and] institutional investors are both looking at the banking system, but now internationally. That‚Äôs dangerous,‚Äù Ball added. ‚ÄúBanks exist because of confidence in their stability, and that confidence can be eroded as we now see, via social media and technology in a matter of minutes.‚Äù  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kYFZ0mb.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/sa1yxWq.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/QsHW7no.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/OGQZBeP.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/uIef67v.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kr3YfHV.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JiYUEBP.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CKcDnul.png))**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vsFHgKf.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mconM20.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H7KFVcz.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ymKQozZ.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TsJcX1J.png))**   *****  &gt; # Best and Worst Stocks Since the COVID Crash Low  &gt; We are now three years out from the COVID Crash low, and even with the past year's weakness, most assets continue to sit on solid gains. For major US index ETFs, the S&amp;P Midcap 400 (IJH) is up the most having slightly more than doubled while the S&amp;P Smallcap 600 (IJR) is not far behind having rallied 95.9%. Value has generally outperformed growth, especially for mid and small-caps although that has shifted somewhat this year. For example, while its gains have been more middling since the COVID crash, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has been the strongest area of the equity market in 2023 thanks to the strength of sectors like Tech (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC). Although those sectors have posted strong gains this year, they have been the weakest over the past three years while Energy (XLE) far and away has been the strongest asset class. Paired with the strength of energy stocks has been solid runs in commodities (DBC)more broadly with the notable exception being Natural Gas (UNG) which has lost over 40%. Bond ETFs are similarly sitting on losses since the COVID Crash lows. As for international markets, Mexico (EWW) and India (PIN) have outpaced the rest of the world although Emerging Markets (EEM) as a whole have not been particularly strong; likely being dragged on by the weaker performance of China (ASHR) which holds a large weight on EEM.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low.png))**  &gt; Taking a look at current S&amp;P 500 members, nearly half of the index has more than doubled over the past three years. As for the absolute best performers, Energy stocks dominate the list with four of the top five best-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks coming from that sector. Targa Resources (TRGP) has been the absolute best performer with a nearly 900% total return. Other notables include a couple of heavy weight stocks: Tesla (TSLA) and NVIDIA (NVDA) with gains of 563.9% and 412.9%, respectively.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low-2.png))**  &gt; On the other end of the spectrum, there are currently 25 stocks that have posted a negative return since the COVID Crash low. The worst has been First Republic Bank (FRC) which has been more of a recent development. Whereas today the stock has posted an 83.1% loss, at the start of this month it would have been a 65% gain. Another standout on the list of worst performers has been Amazon (AMZN). Most other mega caps have more than doubled since the March 2020 S&amp;P 500 low, however, the e-commerce giant has hardly offered a positive return.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # Sector Performance Experiences a Historical Divergence  &gt; The first quarter of 2023 is coming to a close next week, and checking in on year to date performance, there has been a big divergence between the winners and losers. Although the S&amp;P 500 is up 2.84% on the year as of yesterday's close, only three of the eleven sectors are higher. Not only are those three sectors up on the year, but they have posted impressive double digit gains only three months into the year. Of those three, Consumer Discretionary has posted the smallest gain of 10% whereas Technology and Communication Services have risen 17.2% and 18.1%, respectively. The fact that these sectors are home to the main mega cap stocks -- like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have been on an impressive run of late -- helps to explain how the market cap weighted S&amp;P 500 is up on the year without much in the way of healthy breadth on a sector level.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-1a.png))**  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-1.png))**  &gt; One thing that is particularly remarkable about this year's sector performance is just how rare it is for a sector to be up 10%+ (let alone 3) while all other sectors are lower. And that is for any point of the year let alone in the first quarter. As we mentioned in yesterday's Sector Snapshot and show in the charts below, going back to 1990, there have only been two other periods in which a sector has risen at least 10% YTD while all other sectors were lower YTD. The first of those was in May 2009. In a similar instance to now, Consumer Discretionary, Tech, and Materials were the three sectors with double digit gains back then. With those sectors up solidly, the S&amp;P 500 was little changed on the year with a less than 1% gain. As you can see below, though, by the end of 2009, every sector had pushed into positive territory as the new bull market coming out of the global financial crisis was well underway.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-2.png))**  &gt; The next occurrence was much more recent: 2022. Obviously, it was a tough year for equities except for the Energy sector which had a banner year. Throughout most of the year, the sector traded up by well over 20% year to date even while the rest of the equity market was battered.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # The Fed Expects Banking Stress to Substitute for Rate Hikes  &gt; The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 0.25% at their March meeting, bringing it to the 4.75-5.0% range. This is the ninth-straight rate increase and brings rates to their highest level since 2007. However, the most aggressive tightening cycle since the early 1980s, which saw them lift rates all the way from near zero to almost 5%, is near its end.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-target-rate-601x800.png))**  &gt; Up until early February, Fed officials expected to raise rates to a maximum of about 5.1% and hold it there for a while. However, since that time, we‚Äôve gotten a slew of strong economic data, including elevated inflation numbers. This pushed fed officials to give ‚Äúguidance‚Äù that they expected to raise rates by more than they estimated back in December.  &gt; Market expectations for policy also moved in conjunction. Prior to February, markets expected the Fed to raise rates to 5% by June, and subsequently lower them by about 0.5% by the end of the year. But strong incoming data and Fed guidance pushed expectations higher, with the terminal rate moving up to 5.6% and no cuts in 2023.  &gt; # The Silicon Valley Bank crisis changed everything &gt; The bank crisis that erupted over the last couple of weeks resulted in a significant shift, both in expectations for policy and now the Fed as well. See here for our complete rundown on SVB and the ensuing crisis.  &gt; Market expectations for Fed policy rates immediately moved lower. Markets expected the stress in banks to translate to tighter credit conditions, which in turn would lead to slower economic growth and lower inflation.  &gt; This was nicely articulated by Professor Jeremey Siegel, one of the foremost commentators on financial markets and fed policy, in our latest episode of the Facts vs Feelings podcast, Prof. Siegel said that tighter credit conditions, as lending standards become more strict, are de facto rate hikes.  &gt; Fed Chair Powell more or less said exactly the same thing after the Fed‚Äôs March meeting. The 0.25% increase was an attempt to thread the needle between financial stability and fighting inflation. Fed officials also forecast the fed funds rate to hit a maximum of 5.1%, unchanged from their December estimate. This is a marked shift from what was expected just a few weeks ago, with Powell explicitly saying that tighter credit conditions ‚Äúsubstitute‚Äù for rate hikes.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-rate-expectations-600x800.png))**  &gt; # There‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty ahead &gt; While the recent bank stresses are expected to tighten credit conditions and thereby impact economic growth and inflation, there are a couple of open questions:  &gt; * How big will the impact be?  &gt; * How long will the impact last?  &gt; These are unknown currently. Which means future policy is also unknown.  &gt; Fed officials expect to take rates to 5.1%, i.e., one more rate increase. And then expect to hold it there through the end of the year. In short, they don‚Äôt expect rate cuts this year.  &gt; Yet investors expect no more rate increases and about 0.6% of rate cuts in the second half of 2023. Markets expect the policy rate in June to be at 4.8%, while expectations for December are at 4.2%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-implied-policy-rate-differential-600x800.png))**  &gt; There‚Äôs clearly a huge gulf between what the Fed expects versus what investors expect. This will have to reconcile in one of two ways:  &gt; * Market expectations move higher ‚Äì if economic/inflation data remain strong and credit conditions don‚Äôt look to be tightening significantly.  &gt; * Fed expectations move lower ‚Äì if the banking sector comes under renewed stress, credit conditions could tighten significantly and eventually lead to weaker data.  &gt; Things are obviously not going to go in either direction in a straight line. It‚Äôs going to be a bumpy ride as new data points come in, not to mention news/rumors of renewed problems in the banking sector.  *****  &gt; # Seasonality Keeps Claims Below 200K?  &gt; Initial jobless claims remained healthy this week with another sub-200K print. Claims fell modestly to 191K from last week's unrevised reading of 192K. That small decline exceeded expectations of claims rising up to 197K. Given claims continue to impress, the seasonally adjusted number has come in below 200K for 9 of the last 10 weeks. By that measure, it has been the strongest stretch for claims since last April when there were 10 weeks in a row of sub-200K prints. Prior to that, from 2018 through 2020 the late March and early April period similarly saw consistent readings under 200K meaning that some of the strength in the adjusted number could be on account of residual seasonality.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-1.png))**  &gt; In fact, this point of the year has some of the weeks in which claims have the most consistently historically fallen week over week. Taking a historical median of claims throughout the year, claims tend to round out a short-term bottom in the spring before an early summer bump. In other words, seasonal strength will begin to wane in the coming months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-2.png))**  &gt; While initial claims improved, continuing claims worsened rising to 1.694 million from 1.68 million the previous week. Albeit higher, that remains below the 2023 high of 1.715 million set at the end of February.  *****  &gt; # A Fed Day Like Most Others  &gt; Yesterday's Fed decision and comments from Fed Chair Powell gave markets plenty to chew on. As we discussed in last night's Closer and today's Morning Lineup, there have been a number of conflicting statements from officials and confusing reactions in various assets over the past 24 hours. In spite of all that uncertainty, the S&amp;P 500's path yesterday pretty much followed the usual script. In the charts below we show the S&amp;P's average intraday pattern across all Fed days since Powell has been chair (first chart) and the intraday chart of the S&amp;P yesterday (second chart). As shown, the market's pattern yesterday, especially after the 2 PM ET rate decision and the 2:30 PM press conference, closely resembled the average path that the market has followed across all Powell Fed Days since 2018.  &gt; The S&amp;P saw a modest bounce after the 2 PM Fed decision and then a further rally right after Powell's presser began at 2:30 PM. That initial post-presser spike proved to be a pump-fake, as markets ultimately sold off hard with a near 2% decline from 2:30 PM to the 4 PM close.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-1a.png))**  &gt; So what typically happens in the week after Fed days? Since 1994 when the Fed began announcing policy decisions on the same day as its meeting, the S&amp;P has averaged a decline of 10 basis points over the next week. During the current tightening cycle that began about a year ago, market performance in the week after Fed days has been even worse with the S&amp;P averaging a decline of 0.99%. However, when the S&amp;P has been down over 1% on Fed days (like yesterday), performance over the next week has been positive with an average gain of 0.64%. As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-3.png))**  *****   &gt; # What Now? An Update on Recent Bank Stress.  &gt; It‚Äôs been less than 2 weeks since Silicon Valley Bank‚Äôs stunning 48-hour collapse, and a few more banks have been caught in the fray. New York regulators closed the doors on Signature Bank on Sunday, March 12. A week later, US banks injected $30 billion into First Republic Bank to keep it afloat, and UBS acquired rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse in a government-brokered deal. In the midst of the chaos, your Carson Investment Research team was there for you with client-facing content, professional advice, and investment solutions. In fact, we think this event presents an opportunity to invest in the more stable large-cap financial companies and recently upgraded the sector to overweight in our House Views Advice.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mar22_1-1600x927.png))**  &gt; # Why is this happening? &gt; The rapid hike in interest rates caused an asset and liability mismatch for banks. Due to many years of low-interest rates, banks invested assets in interest-earning loans and bonds that would be repaid over the next five-plus years, which at the time was a logical way to earn a higher yield. Regulators considered government bonds to be among the safest ways a bank could invest its capital. As interest rates rose, bond values dropped. Interest rates rose at the fastest pace in history, and the safe assets that banks invested in lost value to the tune of more than $620 billion in unrealized losses as of the end of last year. This decline in value left weaker banks underwater and, when coupled with depositors pulling money out, caused them to collapse or seek costly capital raises.  &gt; # Why this matters to investors? &gt; The weakness in the banking sector will likely lead to tighter lending standards, potentially slowing economic growth. The reason we‚Äôre in this mess, to begin with, is that the Fed hiked interest rates to slow the economy because inflation was rising too quickly. Perhaps the 16% drop in oil prices over the past two weeks reflected this slower growth and bodes well for continued falling inflation. Thus, the Fed is closer to achieving its goal.  &gt; Maybe it‚Äôs an overreaction as ‚Äúbanking crisis‚Äù headlines stir painful memories of 2008. Either way, an environment with slower growth and lower inflation isn‚Äôt a bad time to invest. Bonds and stocks could both perform well, especially stocks of companies with the ability to grow earnings. We also reiterate our House Views Advice overweight on the large-cap Financials sector. The largest US banks are well-capitalized and are gaining market share from the smaller regional banks. We believe this calamity provides an opportunity for stronger banks and investors to capitalize on.  *****  &gt; # FANG+ Flying  &gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup, sector performance has heavily favored areas like Tech, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services in recent weeks. Playing into that sector level performance has been the strength of the mega-caps. The NYSE FANG+ index tracks ten of the largest and most highly traded Tech and Tech-adjacent names. In the past several days, that cohort of stocks is breaking out to the highest level since last April whereas the S&amp;P 500 still needs to rally 4% to reach its February high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-1.png))**  &gt; Although FANG+ stocks have been strong recently, that follows more than a full year of underperformance. As shown below, relative to the S&amp;P 500, mega-cap Tech consistently underperformed from February 2021 through this past fall. In the past few days, the massive outperformance has resulted in a breakout of the downtrend for the ratio of FANG+ to the S&amp;P 500.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-2.png))**  &gt; More impressive is how rapid of a move it has been for that ratio to break out. Below, we show the 2-month percent change in the ratio above. As of the high at yesterday's close, the ratio had risen 22.5% over the prior two months. That comes up just short of the record (22.6%) leading up to the pre-COVID high in February 2020. In other words, mega-cap Tech has experienced near-record outperformance relative to the broader market. However, we would note that this is in the wake of last year when the group had seen some of its worst two-month underperformance on record with the worst readings being in March, May, and November.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # March Seasonality Prevails, Banking Fiasco Be Damned  &gt; It‚Äôs encouraging typical March seasonal patterns have overcome recent bank failures, recession talk and fearmongering. The early March pullback was steeper than normal, but the usual mid-month rebound appears to be materializing.  &gt; Last week‚Äôs gains could be an indication we have seen the worst of the banking fallout and the end of the pullback. Triple Witching Weeks have tended to be down in flat periods and dramatically so during bear markets. Positive March Triple Witching weeks in 2003 and 2009 confirmed the market was back in rally mode.  &gt; The week after March Triple Witching is notoriously nasty. S&amp;P is down 27 of the last 40 year ‚Äì and frequently down sharply. Positive or flat action this week would be constructive.  &gt; In the old days March used to come in like a bull and out like a bear. Nowadays March has evolved into an inflection point where short-term trends often change course. The market is clearly at an important juncture and it‚Äôs a good time to remember Warren Buffet‚Äôs wise words to ‚ÄúBe greedy when others are fearful.‚Äù  &gt; Bank failures are never a good thing, but the swift actions of regulators likely prevented further damage to the industry. At the least, the banks are likely to be under even greater scrutiny going forward. In the near-term we expect more volatile trading. Further out we expect the market, and the economy will recover like they both have historically done.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5fe6f3377343f819ff93c97e8aeb8ffc/1258a39f06bd18c7-63/s500x750/303b38d927e1a424f5dc254dd086678978f2cc12.jpg))**  *****  &gt; # Nasdaq Leaves the S&amp;P in the Dust  &gt; Looking at the major US index ETF screen of our Trend Analyzer shows just how disconnected the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has become from other major index ETFs recently. As shown below, as of Friday's close, QQQ actually finished in overbought territory (over 1 standard above its 50-DMA) whereas many other major index ETFs were oversold, some of those to an extreme degree. On a year to date basis, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has rallied more than 14% compared to low single digit gains or losses for the rest of the pack.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/usindexqqq.png))**  &gt; Historically, the major indices, namely the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, tend to trade at similar overbought and oversold levels. In the chart below we show the Nasdaq 100 and S&amp;P 500's distance from their 50-DMAs (expressed in standard deviations) over the past five years. As shown, typically the two large cap indices have seen similar albeit not identical readings. That is until the past few weeks in which the two have diverged more significantly.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**  &gt; On Friday there was more than 2 standard deviations between the Nasdaq's overbought 50-DMA spread and the S&amp;P 500's oversold spread. As shown in the chart below, that surpassed recent highs in the spread like the spring of 2020 to set the highest reading since October 2016.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**  &gt; Going back to 1985, the spread between the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 50-DMA spreads diverging to such a degree is not without precedent, but it is also not exactly common. Friday marked the 16th time that spread eclipsed 2 standard deviations for the first time in at least 3 months. Relative to those prior instances, the current overbought and oversold readings in both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are relatively middling. However, only the instance in early 2000 similarly saw the Nasdaq technically overbought (trading at least a standard deviation above its 50-DMA) while the S&amp;P 500 was simultaneously oversold (at least one standard deviation below its 50-DMA).  *****  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/mconM20.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/B9lJ6yg.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/kQxLMVP.png))**  *****  &gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).  &gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))  *****  # DISCUSS!

[Can Tesla stock reach $500 in 2024?,;,; Tesla has a remarkable history of delivering strong returns, boasting a trailing 10-year return of 2,560%. Even this year, with a 98% increase in share value, Tesla has outperformed the broader market. Despite currently trading 41% below its peak price of $410, set in November 2021, some optimistic investors are eyeing a target of $500 per share, implying a potential 100% gain.        For Tesla to reach this ambitious goal by the end of 2024, several factors need to come into play. Firstly, the company must demonstrate fundamental improvements, particularly in revenue growth and profitability. However, recent challenges, such as a slower revenue increase of 9% in Q3 2023 and a decline in operating margin to 7.6%, indicate a need for substantial progress in these areas.        Elon Musk attributes the challenges to an unfavorable macroeconomic environment, including higher interest rates affecting car affordability. Additionally, competition and ongoing price cuts have impacted Tesla's profitability.        While revenue and earnings growth are crucial, the missing piece of the puzzle is the valuation. Tesla's current steep price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 78 poses a challenge. The stock's 98% increase this year is attributed to a 105% rise in the P/E multiple, indicating heightened investor enthusiasm.        However, relying on continuous P/E expansion might be unrealistic, especially with already sky-high expectations and an uncertain market influenced by higher interest rates and inflation. To reach $500 per share, Tesla would likely need to deliver exceptional financial results, including a doubling of earnings per share between 2023 and 2024. Given recent trends like revenue slowdown and margin compression, achieving this bullish scenario appears challenging, prompting a cautious approach for investors with tempered expectations for Tesla's future performance.    ,;,; 2023-12-13 11:39:15]

[Tesla cuts U.S. prices for fifth time since January.,;,; https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/07/tesla-cuts-us-prices-for-fifth-time-since-january.html  Tesla cut prices in the United States between 2% and nearly 6%, its website showed on Thursday, as the company extends a discount drive on its electric vehicles that analysts caution could hurt profitability. The fifth such cut in Tesla‚Äôs largest market since the start of the year comes as the United States prepares to adopt tougher standards this month that are expected to limit EV tax credits. Tesla cut prices on both versions of its Model 3 sedan by $1,000 and on its Model Y crossover by $2,000, the website showed. It also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000. The company has said the tougher U.S. standards would reduce the $7,500 tax credit available for its base, rear-wheel drive Model 3 since January.  Some analysts who expected the further price cuts had flagged concern that Tesla‚Äôs industry-leading profit margins could be at risk. This week Tesla reported first-quarter deliveries of almost 423,000 vehicles, up just 4% from the prior quarter after price cuts in the United States, China and other markets aiming to spur demand. Tesla has set a target of 1.8 million deliveries this year. Tesla has cut the price of its base Model 3 by a cumulative 11% since the start of the year, with a 20% reduction on its base Model Y.,;,; 2023-04-07 13:15:37]
[Tesla net income and earnings drop more than 20% from last year,;,; Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.  Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv  Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates  Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.  Automotive revenue, Tesla‚Äôs core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.  Tesla‚Äôs first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.  The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.  Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.  Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.   Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management‚Äôs consideration were seeking updates on the company‚Äôs trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company‚Äôs energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.  In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.  A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day‚Äôs drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.  According to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.  Tesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023.

[Help me understand how Tesla isn't **insanely** overpriced.,;,; Hey everyone. I'm trying to wrap my head around why Tesla's stock is so insanely high with the outlook looking not so great. People keep buying it and I can't understand why, other than people are buying it for a long term AI holding. If thats the case, isn't there FAR better stocks to buy?  https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/price-earnings-peg-ratios  Even looking at 2025, the stock still looks very overpriced at a forward PE of 55.4. PEG ratio is 5.11, lol. I don't know that I've seen a PEG ratio that high before.  There's also some headwinds for Tesla. They recently lost the federal tax credit on most of their lineup. This will undoubtedly affect sales and their margins, but admittedly they should remain profitable without the tax credits. IIRC one of the articles I read said that, without the credits, their margin is around 30%, which is still higher than most auto manufacturers. But still, for this company being valued higher than any other auto manufacturer in the world, even ones that sell exponentially more vehicles, I still don't see how the stock price equals reality.   https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelharley/2023/10/30/5-reasons-why-electric-vehicle-sales-have-slowed/  There has been a slowdown already in electric vehicle sales that will most likely be accelerated by losing the tax credits. Granted that's not all Tesla's fault. We are still a few years away from viable Li-Ion alternatives being ready for mass adoption. Until that happens, the cost of the batteries and rare minerals to make them will remain the biggest hurdle they face. Not to mention hydrogen powered hybrids are slated for mass production starting next year. Electricity rates are constantly increasing. Even if you have a bunch of solar panels, you still paid for that electricity, even if it's cheaper than what you're getting from your utility company. Whereas water is the most abundant resource on the planet. The advantage here does not go for pure electric vehicles IMO.  As far as the AI angle, are they really a competitor when they still only have level 2 autonomous driving? Seems to me like Google would be an infinitely better stock for the AI angle since they are expanding to level 3 and 4 autonomous driving, no? Even if they don't plan on making vehicles, Google seems like the no brainer here and it has very realistic valuations. If im wrong here, please explain why. This post isn't to shit on Tesla stock. I genuinely want to know **if** I'm wrong and why. Thanks everyone!,;,; 2023-12-29 05:19:50]
[We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),;,; \*\* I have no position that is impacted by this post\*\*  Over the past few years, TSLA has performed nothing short of extraordinary. In the last five years, Tesla stock has almost 10x its value. The 857% total return of Tesla is substantially higher than all of its peers, including Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen  Despite strong growth, weakness has begun to present itself within the Wall Street prince in the past year. Tesla announced earlier in February 2023 that it would be cutting prices on the Model Y. This move surprised investors because, before the price cuts, Tesla appeared to be entirely supply-side constrained. However, investors noted that these cuts only impacted higher-end models that were outside the range of the mass vehicle market. However, in April, Tesla announced that it would be cutting prices on the Model 3. Elon Musk has previously alluded to a poor performing EV market in the wake of a higher interest rate environment. Economic data confirms this narrative as Automobile shipments have declined substantially in Q3‚Äô 2023.  However, two factors that cannot be explained by an adverse economic environment are Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Cybertruck demand. FSD is Tesla‚Äôs end-to-end autonomous driving solution.  Tesla‚Äôs FSD is considered a level 2 autonomous driving solution. Level 2 systems require the driver to remain alert at all times with the anticipation that driver will have to take over in every circumstance. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed that FSD would be finished by the end of the year for the past six years. Additionally, Musk has claimed that robo-taxis, completely automated taxi services would be available during the same timeframes. Tesla‚Äôs current FSD beta boasts some impressive technologies, including the ability to navigate through city streets without immediate intervention in many cases. However, level 3 seems to be uncertain  for the car company. On the other hand, Tesla‚Äôs competitors such as Waymo, Mobileye, and Cruise have all operated in some capacity at level 3 or level 4. In particular, Mobileye has proved to be a serious threat to FSD due to its goal of integrating in Tesla‚Äôs competitors. Mobileye has outlined several technologies that are set to compete with Tesla‚Äôs current offerings as well as Tesla‚Äôs future capabilities.  The Cybertruck further highlights Tesla‚Äôs habit of misleading shareholders. The Cybertruck is Tesla‚Äôs consumer pickup truck expected to be launched in Q4 2023. In Tesla‚Äôs Q2 2023 earnings call, Musk stated that Cybertruck demand is, "so off the hook, you can‚Äôt even see the hook.‚Äù EV insider reported that this statement was likely to transfer into 1.9 million preorders. However, Tesla failed to mention that the Cybertruck‚Äôs preorder deposit was $100. In Tesla‚Äôs Q3 earnings call, Musk stated that ‚ÄúWe dug our own grave‚Äù when referring to Cybertruck. He noted that he expects it to be 18 months before Cybertruck is cash flow positive, adding another timeline onto a timeline full of delays. Musk still sees demand surpassing one million units. However, it seems unlikely that demand will be that high, considering high interest rate environment and mere $100 commitment by prospective buyers.,;,; 2023-10-29 14:59:47]
[Ford CEO Jim Farley says Tesla price cuts could start an EV price war,;,; https://news.yahoo.com/ford-ceo-jim-farley-says-110356902.html  Ford CEO Jim Farley said Tesla's price cuts could spark an electric-vehicle price war and transform some into commodities.  At a charity event in Detroit reported on by Bloomberg, Farley said Tesla's attempts to increase sales were "completely rational and should surprise no one."  Elon Musk's company has slashed the price of its cars six times this year, making the EVs more affordable than they have been for years. The cheapest model, Tesla's entry-level Model 3 sedan, now costs less than $40,000.  In January, Ford followed Tesla in cutting EV prices, discounting its plug-in Mustang Mach-E range by between about 1% and 8.8%.  "Price wars are breaking out everywhere," Farley said. Who's going to blink for growth?"  Tesla's price cuts are aimed at undercutting rivals and boosting market share, but the strategy has cost the company.  On Wednesday, the automaker logged revenue of $23.33 billion, which was roughly in line with estimates, according to Refinitiv. But its profits took a hit as net income plummeted 24% year-on-year to $2.51 billion during the three months ending March 31.  Seth Goldstein, an equities strategist for Morningstar, told Insider Tesla's price cuts had left legacy automakers scrambling. He said Ford, which previously predicted its EV business would keep losing money until at least 2026, was faced with the "potential of having to cut prices or hurt profits even more."  "That makes for an interesting scenario in terms of how they respond," Goldstein said.  Farley said at the Detroit event that Ford would focus on areas where there was less competition, such as pickup trucks and vans, Reuters reported.

[How does Tesla go up 7% after all the news about Elon Musk‚Äôs autopilot incident?,;,; I guess I need to add this: I do **not** own any stocks or shorts or puts or whatever related to Tesla, because the way that Tesla works in the market confuses me. I just want to learn.   Everybody also thinks this is an attack on Tesla and Musk. It is **not**. I want to know if this is the way that the market works or not.  Why do I care? Because Tesla is relatively a gigantic company. Why did I ask about if the same would happen with Apple? Because Apple is also a relatively gigantic company.   I thought you were allowed to ask about stocks on this sub.   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  On Friday August 25th, [Elon Musk posted a video on X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1695247110030119054?s=46&amp;t=0YLBKtmQe8-F_nJ00NQvxg), that now has 44 million views, of him driving a Tesla on autopilot. In the video he has to brake the car himself when it almost runs a red light (at around 19:45). It also received a decent amount of news coverage.   This appears to have not affected the stock‚Äôs value at all and as of the closing today (August 29th) the stock is up over 7%  I‚Äôd expect such an incident to have negative effects on a company‚Äôs value, but this didn‚Äôt.   Are these sorts of things usually just not big deals?   If Apple were demonstrating their new iPhone‚Äôs amazing app that works perfectly and then it caused the phone to crash, would that negatively affect the value?  Or is it basically all just about the money that the company brings in?  ‚Äî‚Äî   Thanks to everybody who answered nicely. I‚Äôve gotten some explanations that make sense including:  - Elon‚Äôs livestream video wasn‚Äôt of current autopilot software on Teslas, but rather a beta FSD which performed very well.  - 44 million people probably didn‚Äôt actually see that moment where ‚Äúhuman intervention‚Äù takes place. Plus the media blew it out of proportion.  - Computer trading algorithms don‚Äôt care about these minute things.  - This isn‚Äôt exclusive to Tesla. Similar things like this happening to other gigantic companies happen and they barely matter.  - The market overall went up on the 29th and Tesla has a high beta.

[Tesla CFO Zach Kirkhorn steps down,;,; Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/07/tesla-cfo-zach-kirkhorn-steps-down.html  Tesla ‚Äôs chief financial officer, Zach Kirkhorn, stepped down from his position, effective Aug. 4, the automaker announced Monday morning in a regulatory filing. Tesla‚Äôs chief accounting officer Vaibhav Taneja was appointed as the new CFO and will hold both roles concurrently.  Shares of Tesla were trading down about 2.5% on the news.  Kirkhorn will stay on with Tesla through the end of the year to assist in the transition, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Kirkhorn had served as CFO since March 2019 and had worked for Tesla since 2010.  ‚ÄúAs I shift my responsibilities to support this transition, I want to thank the talented, passionate, and hard-working employees at Tesla, who have accomplished things many thought not possible,‚Äù Kirkhorn wrote on LinkedIn.  Kirkhorn‚Äôs departure marks the second CFO replacement at Tesla in just over four years. When prior CFO Deepak Ahuja left Tesla in 2019, shares dipped as much as 4.5%.  Vaibhav Taneja, Kirkhorn‚Äôs replacement and Tesla‚Äôs former chief accounting officer, has been with the automaker since 2017.

[Source: Tesla rigged the dashboard to overstate battery range; created a ‚ÄúDiversion Team‚Äù to suppress thousands of complaints,;,; In March, Alexandre Ponsin set out on a family road trip from Colorado to California in his newly purchased Tesla, a used 2021 Model 3. He expected to get something close to the electric sport sedan‚Äôs advertised driving range: 353 miles on a fully charged battery.  He soon realized he was sometimes getting less than half that much range, particularly in cold weather ‚Äì such severe underperformance that he was convinced the car had a serious defect.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking at the range, and you literally see the number decrease in front of your eyes,‚Äù he said of his dashboard range meter.  Ponsin contacted Tesla and booked a service appointment in California. He later received two text messages, telling him that ‚Äúremote diagnostics‚Äù had determined his battery was fine, and then: ‚ÄúWe would like to cancel your visit.‚Äù  What Ponsin didn‚Äôt know was that Tesla employees had been instructed to thwart any customers complaining about poor driving range from bringing their vehicles in for service. Last summer, the company quietly created a ‚ÄúDiversion Team‚Äù in Las Vegas to cancel as many range-related appointments as possible.  The Austin, Texas-based electric carmaker deployed the team because its service centers were inundated with appointments from owners who had expected better performance based on the company‚Äôs advertised estimates and the projections displayed by the in-dash range meters of the cars themselves, according to several people familiar with the matter.    A Tesla logo shown outside a Beijing showroom. The automaker‚Äôs estimates of its electric vehicles‚Äô driving range have been among the most aggressive in the industry. It has faced thousands of complaints from customers disappointed by the vehicles‚Äô real-world performance. REUTERS/Thomas Peter Inside the Nevada team‚Äôs office, some employees celebrated canceling service appointments by putting their phones on mute and striking a metal xylophone, triggering applause from coworkers who sometimes stood on desks. The team often closed hundreds of cases a week and staffers were tracked on their average number of diverted appointments per day.  Managers told the employees that they were saving Tesla about $1,000 for every canceled appointment, the people said. Another goal was to ease the pressure on service centers, some of which had long waits for appointments.  In most cases, the complaining customers‚Äô cars likely did not need repair, according to the people familiar with the matter. Rather, Tesla created the groundswell of complaints another way ‚Äì by hyping the range of its futuristic electric vehicles, or EVs, raising consumer expectations beyond what the cars can deliver. Teslas often fail to achieve their advertised range estimates and the projections provided by the cars‚Äô own equipment, according to Reuters interviews with three automotive experts who have tested or studied the company‚Äôs vehicles.  Neither Tesla nor Chief Executive Elon Musk responded to detailed questions from Reuters for this story.  Reuters reporter Steve Stecklow discusses how Tesla has been exaggerating the driving range of its vehicles for years. Tesla years ago began exaggerating its vehicles‚Äô potential driving distance ‚Äì by rigging their range-estimating software. The company decided about a decade ago, for marketing purposes, to write algorithms for its range meter that would show drivers ‚Äúrosy‚Äù projections for the distance it could travel on a full battery, according to a person familiar with an early design of the software for its in-dash readouts.  Then, when the battery fell below 50% of its maximum charge, the algorithm would show drivers more realistic projections for their remaining driving range, this person said. To prevent drivers from getting stranded as their predicted range started declining more quickly, Teslas were designed with a ‚Äúsafety buffer,‚Äù allowing about 15 miles (24 km) of additional range even after the dash readout showed an empty battery, the source said.  The directive to present the optimistic range estimates came from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this person said.  ‚ÄúElon wanted to show good range numbers when fully charged,‚Äù the person said, adding: ‚ÄúWhen you buy a car off the lot seeing 350-mile, 400-mile range, it makes you feel good.‚Äù  Tesla‚Äôs intentional inflation of in-dash range-meter projections and the creation of its range-complaints diversion team have not been previously reported.  Driving range is among the most important factors in consumer decisions on which electric car to buy, or whether to buy one at all. So-called range anxiety ‚Äì the fear of running out of power before reaching a charger ‚Äì has been a primary obstacle to boosting electric-vehicle sales.  At the time Tesla programmed in the rosy range projections, it was selling only two models: the two-door Roadster, its first vehicle, which was later discontinued; and the Model S, a luxury sport sedan launched in 2012. It now sells four models: two cars, the 3 and S; and two crossover SUVs, the X and Y. Tesla plans the return of the Roadster, along with a ‚ÄúCybertruck‚Äù pickup.  Reuters could not determine whether Tesla still uses algorithms that boost in-dash range estimates. But automotive testers and regulators continue to flag the company for exaggerating the distance its vehicles can travel before their batteries run out.  Tesla was fined earlier this year by South Korean regulators who found the cars delivered as little as half their advertised range in cold weather. Another recent study found that three Tesla models averaged 26% below their advertised ranges.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has required Tesla since the 2020 model year to reduce the range estimates the automaker wanted to advertise for six of its vehicles by an average of 3%. The EPA told Reuters, however, that it expects some variation between the results of separate tests conducted by automakers and the agency.  Data collected in 2022 and 2023 from more than 8,000 Teslas by Recurrent, a Seattle-based EV analytics company, showed that the cars‚Äô dashboard range meters didn‚Äôt change their estimates to reflect hot or cold outside temperatures, which can greatly reduce range.  Recurrent found that Tesla‚Äôs four models almost always calculated that they could travel more than 90% of their advertised EPA range estimates regardless of external temperatures. Scott Case, Recurrent‚Äôs chief executive, told Reuters that Tesla‚Äôs range meters also ignore many other conditions affecting driving distance.  Electric cars can lose driving range for a lot of the same reasons as gasoline cars ‚Äî but to a greater degree. The cold is a particular drag on EVs, slowing the chemical and physical reactions inside their batteries and requiring a heating system to protect them. Other drains on the battery include hilly terrain, headwinds, a driver‚Äôs lead foot and running the heating or air-conditioning inside the cabin.  Tesla discusses the general effect of such conditions in a ‚ÄúRange Tips‚Äù section of its website. The automaker also recently updated its vehicle software to provide a breakdown of battery consumption during recent trips with suggestions on how range might have been improved.  Tesla vehicles provide range estimates in two ways: One through a dashboard meter of current range that‚Äôs always on, and a second projection through its navigation system, which works when a driver inputs a specific destination. The navigation system‚Äôs range estimate, Case said, does account for a wider set of conditions, including temperature. While those estimates are ‚Äúmore realistic,‚Äù they still tend to overstate the distance the car can travel before it needs to be recharged, he said.  Recurrent tested other automakers‚Äô in-dash range meters ‚Äì  including the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Hyundai Kona ‚Äì and found them to be more accurate. The Kona‚Äôs range meter generally underestimated the distance the car could travel, the tests showed. Recurrent conducted the study with the help of a National Science Foundation grant.  Tesla, Case said, has consistently designed the range meters in its cars to deliver aggressive rather than conservative estimates: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where Tesla has taken a different path from most other automakers.‚Äù   Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, shown here in Beijing this year, gave the directive about a decade ago to write software for vehicles that gave drivers ‚Äúrosy‚Äù estimates of driving range, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. REUTERS/Tingshu Wang Failed tests and false advertising  Tesla isn‚Äôt the only automaker with cars that don‚Äôt regularly achieve their advertised ranges.  One of the experts, Gregory Pannone, co-authored a study of 21 different brands of electric vehicles, published in April by SAE International, an engineering organization. The research found that, on average, the cars fell short of their advertised ranges by 12.5% in highway driving.  The study did not name the brands tested, but Pannone told Reuters that three Tesla models posted the worst performance, falling short of their advertised ranges by an average of 26%.  The EV pioneer pushes the limits of government testing regulations that govern the claims automakers put on window stickers, the three automotive experts told Reuters.  Like their gas-powered counterparts, new electric vehicles are required by U.S. federal law to display a label with fuel-efficiency information. In the case of EVs, this is stated in miles-per-gallon equivalent (MPGe), allowing consumers to compare them to gasoline or diesel vehicles. The labels also include estimates of total range: how far an EV can travel on a full charge, in combined city and highway driving.  ‚ÄúThey've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests.‚Äù  EV makers have a choice in how to calculate a model‚Äôs range. They can use a standard EPA formula that converts fuel-economy results from city and highway driving tests to calculate a total range figure. Or automakers can conduct additional tests to come up with their own range estimate. The only reason to conduct more tests is to generate a more favorable estimate, said Pannone, a retired auto-industry veteran.  Tesla conducts additional range tests on all of its models. By contrast, many other automakers, including Ford, Mercedes and Porsche, continue to rely on the EPA‚Äôs formula to calculate potential range, according to agency data for 2023 models. That generally produces more conservative estimates, Pannone said.  Mercedes-Benz told Reuters it uses the EPA‚Äôs formula because it believes it provides a more accurate estimate. ‚ÄúWe follow a certification strategy that reflects the real-world driving behavior of our customers in the best possible way,‚Äù the German carmaker said in a statement.  Ford and Porsche didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment.    A screengrab from Tesla‚Äôs website advertising the Model S sport sedan. Driving range is among the most important factors considered by electric vehicle buyers. Whatever an automaker decides, the EPA must approve the window-sticker numbers. The agency told Reuters it conducts its own tests on 15% to 20% of new electric vehicles each year as part of an audit program and has tested six Tesla models since the 2020 model year.  EPA data obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act showed that the audits resulted in Tesla being required to lower all the cars‚Äô estimated ranges by an average of 3%. The projected range for one vehicle, the 2021 Model Y Long Range AWD (all-wheel drive), dropped by 5.15%. The EPA said all the changes to Tesla‚Äôs range estimates were made before the company used the figures on window stickers.  The EPA said it has seen ‚Äúeverything‚Äù in its audits of EV manufacturers‚Äô range testing, including low and high estimates from other automakers. ‚ÄúThat is what we expect when we have new manufacturers and new technologies entering the market  and why EPA prioritizes‚Äù auditing them, the agency said.  The EPA cautioned that individuals‚Äô actual experience with vehicle efficiency might differ from the estimates the agency approves. Independent automotive testers commonly examine the EPA-approved fuel-efficiency or driving range claims against their own experience in structured tests or real-world driving. Often, they get different results, as in the case of Tesla vehicles.  Pannone called Tesla ‚Äúthe most aggressive‚Äù electric-vehicle manufacturer when it comes to range calculations.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not suggesting they‚Äôre cheating,‚Äù Pannone said of Tesla. ‚ÄúWhat they‚Äôre doing, at least minimally, is leveraging the current procedures more than the other manufacturers.‚Äù  Jonathan Elfalan, vehicle testing director for the automotive website Edmunds.com, reached a similar conclusion to Pannone after an extensive examination of vehicles from Tesla and other major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Hyundai and Porsche.  All five Tesla models tested by Edmunds failed to achieve their advertised range, the website reported in February 2021. All but one of 10 other models from other manufacturers exceeded their advertised range.  Tesla complained to Edmunds that the test failed to account for the safety buffer programmed into Tesla‚Äôs in-dash range meters. So Edmunds did further testing, this time running the vehicles, as Tesla requested, past the point where their range meters indicated the batteries had run out.  Only two of six Teslas tested matched their advertised range, Edmunds reported in March 2021. The tests found no fixed safety buffer.  Edmunds has continued to test electric vehicles, using its own standard method, to see if they meet their advertised range estimates. As of July, no Tesla vehicle had, Elfalan said.  ‚ÄúThey've gotten really good at exploiting the rule book and maximizing certain points to work in their favor involving EPA tests,‚Äù Elfalan told Reuters. The practice can ‚Äúmisrepresent what their customers will experience with their vehicles.‚Äù  South Korean regulators earlier this year fined Tesla about $2.1 million for falsely advertised driving ranges on its local website between August 2019 and December 2022. The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) found that Tesla failed to tell customers that cold weather can drastically reduce its cars‚Äô range. It cited tests by the country‚Äôs environment ministry that showed Tesla cars lost up to 50.5% of the company‚Äôs claimed ranges in cold weather.  The KFTC also flagged certain statements on Tesla‚Äôs website, including one that claimed about a particular model: ‚ÄúYou can drive 528 km (328 miles) or longer on a single charge.‚Äù Regulators required Tesla to remove the ‚Äúor longer‚Äù phrase.  Korean regulators required Tesla to publicly admit it had misled consumers. Musk and two local executives did so in a June 19 statement, acknowledging ‚Äúfalse/exaggerated advertising.‚Äù   So-called range anxiety - the fear of getting stranded in an electric car before reaching a charger - has been a major obstacle to increasing electric vehicle sales. REUTERS/Albert Gea Creating a diversion  By last year, sales of Tesla‚Äôs electric vehicles were surging. The company delivered about 1.3 million cars in 2022, nearly 13 times more than five years before.  As sales grew, so did demand for service appointments. The wait for an available booking was sometimes a month, according to one of the sources familiar with the diversion team‚Äôs operations.  Tesla instructs owners to book appointments through a phone app. The company found that many problems could be handled by its ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù service teams, who can remotely diagnose and fix various issues.  Tesla supervisors told some virtual team members to steer customers away from bringing their cars into service whenever possible. One current Tesla ‚ÄúVirtual Service Advisor‚Äù described part of his job in his LinkedIn profile: ‚ÄúDivert customers who do not require in person service.‚Äù  Such advisors handled a variety of issues, including range complaints. But last summer, Tesla created the Las Vegas ‚ÄúDiversion Team‚Äù to handle only range cases, according to the people familiar with the matter.  The office atmosphere at times resembled that of a telemarketing boiler room. A supervisor had purchased the metallophone ‚Äì a xylophone with metal keys ‚Äì that employees struck to celebrate appointment cancellations, according to the people familiar with the office‚Äôs operations.  Advisers would normally run remote diagnostics on customers‚Äô cars and try to call them, the people said. They were trained to tell customers that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction, not an actual measurement, and that batteries degrade over time, which can reduce range. Advisors would offer tips on extending range by changing driving habits.  If the remote diagnostics found anything else wrong with the vehicle that was not related to driving range, advisors were instructed not to tell the customer, one of the sources said. Managers told them to close the cases.  Tesla also updated its phone app so that any customer who complained about range could no longer book service appointments, one of the sources said. Instead, they could request that someone from Tesla contact them. It often took several days before owners were contacted because of the large backlog of range complaints, the source said.   Tesla recently stopped owners from using its app to book service appointments relating to complaints about driving range. Instead, it gave them tips on increasing range and directed their inquiries to a ‚ÄúDiversion Team‚Äù tasked with preventing service-center visits. The update routed all U.S. range complaints to the Nevada diversion team, which started in Las Vegas and later moved to the nearby suburb of Henderson. The team was soon fielding up to 2,000 cases a week, which sometimes included multiple complaints from customers frustrated they couldn't book a service appointment, one of the people said.  The team was expected to close about 750 cases a week. To accomplish that, office supervisors told advisers to call a customer once and, if there was no answer, to close the case as unresponsive, the source said. When customers did respond, advisers were told to try to complete the call in no more than five minutes.  In late 2022, managers aiming to quickly close cases told advisors to stop running remote diagnostic tests on the vehicles of owners who had reported range problems, according to one of the people familiar with the diversion team‚Äôs operations.  ‚ÄúThousands of customers were told there is nothing wrong with their car‚Äù by advisors who had never run diagnostics, the person said.  Reuters could not establish how long the practice continued.  Tesla recently stopped using its diversion team in Nevada to handle range-related complaints, according to the person familiar with the matter. Virtual service advisors in an office in Utah are now handling range cases, the person said. Reuters could not determine why the change was made.   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) signs off on fuel economy and driving range estimates.  The EPA required Tesla to slightly lower driving range estimates that it planned to put on window stickers for six recent models after the agency‚Äôs own testing. But the EPA said such variation is not uncommon in testing by makers of electric vehicles. On the road  By the time Alexandre Ponsin reached California on his March road trip, he had stopped to charge his Model 3‚Äôs battery about a dozen times.  Concerned that something was seriously wrong with the car, he had called and texted with several Tesla representatives. One of them booked the first available appointment in Santa Clara ‚Äì about two weeks away ‚Äì but advised him to show up at a Tesla service center as soon as he arrived in California.  Ponsin soon received a text saying that remote diagnostics had shown his battery ‚Äúis in good health.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe would like to cancel your visit for now if you have no other concerns,‚Äù the text read.  ‚ÄúOf course I still have concerns,‚Äù Ponsin shot back. ‚ÄúI have 150 miles of range on a full charge!‚Äù  The next day, he received another text message asking him to cancel the appointment. ‚ÄúI am sorry, but no I do not want to close the service appointment as I do not feel my concerns have been addressed,‚Äù he replied.  Undeterred, Ponsin brought his car to the Santa Clara service center without an appointment. A technician there told him the car was fine. ‚ÄúIt lasted 10 minutes,‚Äù Ponsin said, ‚Äúand they didn‚Äôt even look at the car physically.‚Äù  After doing more research into range estimates, he said he ultimately concluded there is nothing wrong with his car. The problem, he said, was that Tesla is overstating its performance. He believes Tesla ‚Äúshould be a lot more explicit about the variation in the range,‚Äù especially in very cold weather.  ‚ÄúI do love my Tesla,‚Äù the engineer said. ‚ÄúBut I have just tempered my expectation of what it can do in certain conditions.‚Äù,;,; 2023-07-27 15:23:23]
[Tesla stock extends record streak to 13 sessions,;,; Tesla shares are up a whopping 41% during that time.     Tesla ($TSLA) shares jumped 3.6% today, extending the company‚Äôs record winning streak to 13 sessions in a row. In that time, shares have risen nearly 42%, adding further gains to an already big year for Tesla shareholders.     Tesla stock is rising in tandem with the overall market today on cooling inflation data, but the shares have been on the rise for a couple weeks now. The latest big news came late last week when General Motors (GM) announced it was joining forces with Tesla to leverage the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger Network. The companies announced the Tesla Supercharger Network will be open to GM EV drivers starting next year, and by 2025 GM anticipates its EVs will include Tesla‚Äôs NACs connector, which will allow for direct access to Tesla Superchargers.  GM‚Äôs move comes two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.   Several industry analysts recently told Yahoo Finance that Tesla's partnership with Ford would be a positive tailwind for Tesla's revenue moving forward.   "Recall in our 2022 report that we sized the potential for Tesla opening its network more widely in the next few years (i.e. more than just Ford) at $1-$3 bn of incremental revenue (although Tesla wouldn‚Äôt necessarily capture all of this)," Goldman analyst Mark Delaney wrote in a note following the Ford deal. "We believe the news is a modest incremental positive for Tesla as it will likely bring in additional profits and help Tesla to sustain the most robust charging network, albeit with some risk of fewer vehicle sales."Nonetheless it hasn‚Äôt all been good news for Tesla during the recent run-up, as the stock brushed aside negative reports about the upcoming and highly anticipated Cybertruck. Per leaked internal documents that German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on, as picked up by Wired, Tesla engineers have had some big concerns about the Cybertruck‚Äôs capabilities.   Preproduction ‚Äúalpha‚Äù versions of the Cybertruck were struggling with basic issues like suspension, body sealing, noise levels, handling, and braking, Wired reports. An automotive engineer Wired spoke with said a company like Tesla has the financial resources to address the issues, but the engineer was still ‚Äúastounded‚Äù that Tesla was struggling with some basic engineering issues with the Cybertruck.   Tesla CEO Elon Musk has nonetheless promised the company will hold a Cybertruck delivery event later in Q3, with limited production volumes beginning later this year.

[Tesla's Bull Case,;,; I see a lot of negative sentiment around Tesla and a true lack of understanding of what is to come.  I have been in Tesla since 2017 and this company has evolved in ways I never imagined.  I am more bullish today than I have ever been.  This is not investment advice and I honestly don't care whether you buy, sell, short, use options or anything else.  &amp;#x200B;  People see Tesla's market cap of approximately $575 billion and immediately think it's overvalued.  They only make X amount, they only sold X amount, and Elon said/did this today.  &amp;#x200B;  If it were as easy as looking at what a company currently is, or what they have done, everyone would be rich.  That is not how investing works.  There needs to be an understanding of what the future will look like.  &amp;#x200B;  The future I see is one of abundance of labor, energy, time, etc.  &amp;#x200B;  Tesla is set up to capitalize like no other company in history and become larger than anything anyone has ever built before.  &amp;#x200B;  Lets focus on the now for a moment though.  &amp;#x200B;  Things to understand, the company has the #1 selling vehicle in the world.  Not just #1 EV, it's the #1 car.  The TAM for there current lineup of vehicles is approaching it's cap with current interest rates and pricing.  The growth will be moderate compared to what people are use too from Tesla.  The current lineup of vehicles is printing money for them though, which is padding there balance sheet now with $29 billion in cash, about 5% of the market cap and the rest covering all of their current investments in the future and operations.  So for 2024 we can expect moderate volume growth and everyone already knows.  What will margins look like in 2024, nobody really knows, some people think it will continue to trend down, some people think it bottomed in Q3, when it bounced up slightly in Q4. Regardless I know that they will be printing more money and strengthening their balance sheet further while growing current projects.  They will also be ramping the Cybertruck as well this year, new product for which I expect in the 75k-100k range produced/delivered.  So that is vehicle outlook for 2024.  &amp;#x200B;  What about energy which just seems like a completely overlooked aspect of the business.  They delivered over 14 gwh of energy storage in 2023, up from 6 gwh in 2022.  The Lathrop factory is scaling to produce 40 gwh annually and they have a new factory in shanghai on the books to come on later this year for an additional 40 gwh of production.  Tesla did about $3.9 billion in revenue in 2022 from energy,  around $6.4 billion 2023.  They only deployed 14 gwh of what will soon be 80 gwh of capacity and it already is starting to impact their profits positively and becoming a meaningful source of profits and revenue.  So while the vehicle business will have lower growth in 2024, the energy business will have accelerated growth.  What about batteries? Tesla is ramping their own 4680's and expects to install additional lines later this year and produce all they need for the Cybertruck ramp as well as Semi and future projects that require it.  The IRA bill that passed is going to pay Tesla for the production of these batteries.  They literally are looking to be at a production rate of 100 gwhr of 4680's annually later this year and will get paid per kwhr produced.  This amount of money that will come in is not understood yet.  So for 2024, energy is entering into a very interesting and lucrative phase.  &amp;#x200B;  I am not really going to touch on charging much but their network of chargers continues to grow, other vehicle manufactures will gain access this year as well as all the new Tesla's produced, this is something to consider.  &amp;#x200B;  Okay so that covers 2024, I expect earnings to be far better than people expect, especially in the latter half of the year.  &amp;#x200B;  What about the future?  The TAM for vehicles will be expanding massively.  They already said they plan to produce their next generation vehicle in 2025 in Austin and then expand to their new factory in Mexico, and another undecided location for a factory overseas.  The #1 selling car is the Model Y at over 1.2 million sold annually.  What happens when there is a new vehicle for a fraction of the cost made by Tesla.  I don't even know if it will qualify for the POS tax credit from the IRA but if it does, the price for this car could be insane. It's already expected to be sub 25k. This thing will sell many millions and usher in that next wave of vehicle growth. The car goes into production next year, did I say that already, NEXT YEAR.  &amp;#x200B;  Lets talk about what is probably the greatest opportunity of our lifetime, I am not even talking about FSD for autonomous vehicles which would revolutionize travel and the economics of it for people and the company, I am talking about Humanoid Bots.  I don't think people understand that they are coming, not just from Tesla but multiple companies and they are around the corner.  This is real, everyone is asleep right now and don't realize but this is happening.  They are going to be filling labor gaps initially, and eventually will be everywhere will Millions shipping.  &amp;#x200B;  The economics for this type of product is hard to fathom, people do not understand and Tesla is the best positioned out of any company with their manufacturing capabilities, engineering, ai background and access to capital.  &amp;#x200B;  So while I believe 2024 will be better than people realize thanks to stable margins from vehicles, acceleration of growth in energy, and a tam expansion coming in 2025 to lead the next wave of volume and eps growth, these things will pale in comparison to what this Bot represents and it is not priced in, nor is the next gen vehicle.  &amp;#x200B;  Do your own DD, make your own decision, but I am ready for what is to come and will capitalize on it.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2024-01-28 23:50:35]

Here are the key numbers from the electric vehicle maker:  Total deliveries Q1 2023: 422,875  Total production Q1 2023: 440,808  Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by Tesla and are not broken out by individual model or region.  The first quarter numbers represent a 36% increase in deliveries compared to the 310,048 reported during the same period a year earlier, and 4% growth in deliveries sequentially compared to the 405,278 they company reported in the last quarter of 2022.  The company reported deliveries of 10,695 of its higher-priced Model S and X vehicles, about 2% of deliveries in the quarter.  Tesla reported deliveries of 412,180 of its lower priced Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover during the quarter.  The company did not include production and delivery numbers for its heavy-duty Semi trucks.   Tesla said it produced 19,437 Model S and X vehicles, and 421,371 of its Model 3 and Y vehicles for the period ending March 31, 2023.  ‚ÄúWe continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds,‚Äù the company wrote in a statement Sunday.  Tesla now sells four models which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the US, one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin. In March, CEO Elon Musk announced the company plans to build a new factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day‚Äôs drive from its factory in Austin, Texas.  The company also produces a heavy-duty truck, the Semi, at its battery plant in Sparks, Nevada. The company began deliveries of the Semi in December 2022.  According to a mean of estimates, compiled by FactSet as of Friday, Wall Street was expecting Tesla to report deliveries around 432,000 vehicles for the quarter. Estimates included in the FactSet analysis ranged from 410,000 to 451,000 deliveries expected.  The independent researcher who publishes under the handle TroyTeslike was expecting deliveries of 427,000 and production totaling 445,920 vehicles.  The first quarter of 2023 was marked by repeated price cuts by Tesla including in the U.S., Europe and China.  Tesla‚Äôs moves sparked a so-called ‚Äúprice war‚Äù in EVs, and posed a challenge to competitors including Ford and General Motors who are trying to gain marketshare in the fully electric vehicle segment domestically.

[Tesla CEO Elon Musk's demand warning spurs a selloff in EV stocks.,;,; Elon Musk's warning about high-interest rates potentially impacting electric vehicle demand caused a significant drop in the shares of various companies in the EV sector, including Tesla. **Tesla's stock closed down 9.3%**, resulting in a loss of over $70 billion in market value. **Rival companies like Rivian, Lucid Group**, and **Fisker also saw their stocks decline by 4% to 5%**, while **legacy automakers like Ford experienced a 2% drop.**        This change in tone from Tesla's CEO, who previously claimed the company was "recession-resilient," comes after Tesla missed revenue estimates by a significant margin and Musk acknowledged the difficulty of maintaining a 50% annual delivery growth rate. Some analysts expressed disappointment in Tesla's recent performance.        To meet its annual delivery target of 1.8 million vehicles, Tesla is expected to further reduce prices in the current quarter, even though its gross margin contracted from 25.1% to 17.9% in the past year. Analysts are skeptical about whether Tesla can maintain a sustained profitability advantage in the competitive auto industry.        Fifteen analysts lowered their price targets for Tesla, resulting in a median target price of $260. While Tesla's stock had been performing well in 2023 due to optimism about its ability to outperform competitors and the potential of its self-driving technology, it now trades at a much higher multiple of its forward earnings estimates compared to traditional automakers like Ford and General Motors.        In conclusion, the electric vehicle market is facing uncertainties, and Tesla's recent challenges have raised questions about its growth prospects and valuation in a competitive industry.    ,;,; 2023-10-20 10:21:41]
[Tesla stock falls more than 5% after hours as Investor Day falls short on detail,;,; https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/01/tesla-2023-investor-day-after-the-bell-master-plan-part-3-teased.html  Electric vehicle maker Tesla hosted a 2023 Investor Day presentation in Austin, Texas, on Wednesday. CEO Elon Musk took the stage to share his ‚ÄúMaster Plan 3,‚Äù and to discuss how Tesla plans to scale up in the face of increasing competition.  The presentation was long on vision, and included a review of prior achievements, but short on specifics about any new Tesla products or services.  Near the beginning of the presentation, Musk said, ‚ÄúThere is a clear path to a sustainable-energy Earth. It doesn‚Äôt require destroying natural habitats. It doesn‚Äôt require us to be austere and stop using electricity and be in the cold or anything.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúIn fact, you could support a civilization much bigger than Earth, much more than the 8 billion humans could actually be supported sustainably on Earth.‚Äù  Musk was initially joined on stage by the Senior Vice President of Powertrain and Energy Engineering at Tesla, Drew Baglino. They discussed a future in which the company would play a role in ‚Äúre-powering the grid with renewable fuels‚Äù as they ramp up battery production, both for Tesla‚Äôs electric vehicles and for the company‚Äôs utility-scale energy storage systems.  Tesla‚Äôs goal is to produce 20 million electric vehicles per year by 2030, executives reiterated. The company reported full-year deliveries of around 1.31 million vehicles in 2022.  During a question and answer session following the 3-hour presentation, executives fielded a question about how Tesla could grow its market share in China.  Elon Musk passed the question to Tom Zhu, who is heading up global production and has run the China and APAC businesses for Tesla for years. ‚ÄúAs long as you offer a product with value at affordable price you don‚Äôt have to worry about demand,‚Äù Zhu said. ‚ÄúWe try everything to cut costs,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúand pass down that value to our customers.‚Äù  Musk then added, ‚ÄúDemand is a function of affordability not desire.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúEven small changes in the price have a big effect on demand.‚Äù  Zhu also announced that as of Wednesday, Tesla had produced 4 million cars in total.  ‚ÄúIt took us 12 years to build the first million, and about 18 months to the second million. The third million, 11 months. Then less than 7 months to build the 4 millionth,‚Äù Zhu said touting the company‚Äôs improving operational efficiency.  He said that the company plans to build new car and battery cell factories, and also to produce more cars per year at its existing factories.  Tesla charging leader Rebecca Tinucci said that in 2022 the company provided 9 terawatt hours across charging methods, including home charging including 40,000 Superchargers. (By way of comparison, the entire U.S. consumes about 4,000 terawatt hours of electricity per year.) Tinucci also noted that about half of the company‚Äôs Superchargers in the EU are open to other vehicles, and that the company just opened 10 Superchargers in the US to non-Teslas.  Tesla design leader Franz von Holzhausen and vice president of vehicle engineering Lars Moravy took the stage to show off a number of planned manufacturing changes meant to improve the efficiency of Tesla vehicle production. But von Holzhausen said that Tesla would not yet reveal its ‚Äúnext gen‚Äù vehicle.  The company‚Äôs powertrain vice president, Colin Campbell, said that Tesla‚Äôs next powertrain factory will be 50% smaller than the one in Austin, Texas, but will have the same capacity. He also said the company is working on a new kind of drive unit that is compatible with any battery cell type, and a motor that will be built without any rare earth metals.  Ahead of the 2023 Investor Day, at a press conference on Tuesday, Mexico president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Tesla had agreed to build a large factory in Monterrey, Mexico. He said Tesla agreed to use recycled water and take other initiatives to cope with water-scarcity in the region.  Musk confirmed the factory plans on Wednesday, and said production there would supplement, rather than replace, any manufacturing at other Tesla facilities.  Tesla shares have rebounded from declines during 2022, and are up more than 60% for the year so far. However, the stock dropped 1.43% on Wednesday prior to the event, and 5% after hours.  Mizuho Securities analysts maintained a buy rating on shares of Tesla ahead of Investor Day, seeing Tesla in a leadership position in a growing market for fully electric vehicles. They wrote in a note earlier this week, ‚ÄúNear-term, we see continued strength in TSLA‚Äôs market share, but see cheaper competitor EVs coming to market as potentially dilutive to TSLA‚Äôs share of the US EV market.‚Äù  Currently, the lowest-priced Tesla available is the Model 3 sedan, which starts at a price point of around $43,000, they wrote. Seven models from other automakers are currently priced below that, Mizhuo noted.  Musk‚Äôs ambitious Master Plan Part Deux was published in 2016, and has not been completely fulfilled. It included four main objectives:  ‚ÄúCreate stunning solar roofs with seamlessly integrated battery storage‚Äù  ‚ÄúExpand the electric vehicle product line to address all major segments‚Äù  ‚ÄúDevelop a self-driving capability that is 10X safer than manual via massive fleet learning‚Äù  ‚ÄúEnable your car to make money for you when you aren‚Äôt using it‚Äù.,;,; 2023-03-02 03:31:46]

[Tesla Starts Offering 84-Month Loans as Interest Rates Rise,;,; Tesla Inc. has started offering consumers 84-month auto loans after Elon Musk said the carmaker would ‚Äúhave to do something‚Äù about rising interest rates. The company now includes seven-year loans as an option on its US order pages, after previously offering loans as long as 72 months. While extending loan terms can lower car buyers‚Äô monthly payments, consumers tend to pay more in interest and face greater risk of owing more than their vehicle is worth.  Tesla‚Äôs chief executive officer has been a frequent critic of the Federal Reserve. Musk tweeted in November that the central bank‚Äôs rate increases were ‚Äúmassively amplifying the probability of a severe recession.‚Äù His predictions of impending deflation haven‚Äôt yet panned out.‚ÄúWhen interest rates rise dramatically, we actually have to reduce the price of the car, because the interest payments increase the price of the car,‚Äù Musk said during Tesla‚Äôs July 19 earnings call. ‚ÄúSo we have to do something about that.‚Äù  While 84-month auto loans have been gaining in popularity, the trend slowed early this year, according to credit-reporting company Experian. Roughly 34% of new vehicles loans in the first quarter were longer than six years, down from about 38% a year ago. Tesla delivered a record 466,140 vehicles during the three months that ended in June but has sold fewer cars than it‚Äôs produced each of the last five quarters.

[Tesla stock closes below $200, hits 5-month low as a tough October rolls on,;,; Despite a larger market gain, Tesla (TSLA) shares fell 4.8% on Monday, going below $200 and reaching its lowest level since late May. The drop was caused by two major factors:        **1.** Tesla's battery supplier, Panasonic, cut vehicle battery output in Japan during the third quarter, decreasing its annual profit prediction by 15%. This was attributable to a worldwide slowdown in EV sales. Panasonic provides battery cells to Tesla's Nevada Gigafactory in the United States. However, the Japanese manufacturing drop had an impact on customers worldwide, not only in North America.        **2.** ON Semiconductor revealed lower-than-expected profit and revenue guidance due to decreasing sales. ON Semiconductor manufactures silicon carbide chips used by Tesla in its EV powertrain and other important components. A decline in demand for these chips is viewed as a possible indicator of slowing EV sales, notably for Tesla.        Tesla investor Gary Black said that the stock's downturn could be attributed to ON Semiconductor's -18% projection failure. This was owing to concerns about the increasing danger to vehicle demand caused by rising interest rates.

[Tesla Stock booms with $32,000 starting price for model 3 after tax credit,;,; All of the Tesla (TSLA) Model 3 vehicle trims are now eligible for the full tax credit under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Internal Revenue Service verified Tuesday. While it remains unclear how the global EV giant accomplished the feat, the Model 3 now has a starting price of around $32,000. TSLA stock jumped Wednesday.  **Tesla stock advanced 1.6% to 224.83 Wednesday during market trade with Tesla Model 3 vehicles going for as low as $30,330 on the company's website.**   Tesla is officially saying the Model 3 starts at $32,740 after the $7,500 IRA tax credit. Meanwhile, reports circulated early Wednesday that Tesla has agreed in principle with a plan to set up a manufacturing plant in India. Tesla's website recently stated that the base Model 3 vehicle was eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit under the IRA. The model previously only qualified at the $3,750 level. Tesla has not disclosed how it brought the Model 3 into alignment with IRA requirements for the full tax credit. Meanwhile, the IRS made the official change to its site Tuesday morning. It announced all Model 3 and Model Y vehicles qualify for the $7,500 tax credit.  # Model 3 Tax Credit Doubles  The Biden administration said on March 31 that vehicles eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit must have batteries with specific quantities of components manufactured in North America and critical minerals sourced in the U.S. or from certain countries.  Vehicles that meet only one of the critical minerals or battery components requirements are eligible for a $3,750 tax credit. At the time, the base rear-wheel-drive Model 3, with its battery from China, did not qualify for the full tax credit.   **Tesla stock shrugged off early losses and climbed 1.7% to 221.31 Tuesday. It turned higher just after the IRS confirmed the Model 3 eligibility. TSLA has gained in the past seven sessions. It has gained 117% since early January lows of 101.81.**  # The Eligibility Switch  Late Monday, Morgan Stanley Adam Jonas wrote the qualification change "implies that Tesla likely tweaked its supply chain to meet both requirements.  "Tesla has used lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries from China's CATL for the base Model 3. CATL commented Monday that rumors Tesla has ended their relationship are untrue and there is no change in the strategic partnership.   Jonas told investors Tesla may have switched to manufacturing Model 3 battery packs in the U.S. while still using China-made battery cells. The analysts also floated the idea that, with Shanghai Tesla exporting to Canada, it could be freeing up U.S. battery production for local deliveries.   Or, Jonas said, it simply could be "regulatory semantics." Under guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury, EV manufacturers can average the qualifying critical mineral content used over a limited period of time. Jonas said this language means Tesla could produce enough qualifying Model 3 batteries at its Fremont plant to offset the Model 3 rear-wheel drive trim's China-made battery.,;,; 2023-06-08 07:22:29]
[Tesla or Nvidia or Microsoft over the next 1-3 years?,;,; I'm interested in what your guys thoughts are on these 3 companies trajectories in the near future.  Tesla is actively reducing the prices on their EVs while other automakers can barely make a profit with their higher prices. I think they are just so far ahead of the competition that they will increase their market share along with the entire EV market growing.  Nvidia is obviously the king of AI right now and probably for the foreseeable future. Their forward PE is 40 and not too high for a growth stock.

The report cited a source familiar with an early design of Tesla software, who claimed the EV maker rigged the range-estimating software on the cars' dashboards.  The Reuters investigation also cited sources with knowledge of a secret team set up to cancel service appointments from drivers with range issues. The secret "Diversion Team" set up in Las Vegas was the result of a flood of complaints about driving range concerning cars that often did not require repairs, per Reuters.,;,; 2023-08-04 13:15:29]

DETROIT ‚Äì United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain wants to expand the union‚Äôs battle from the Detroit automakers to Tesla, Toyota Motor and other non-unionized automakers operating in the U.S.  The outspoken leader plans to use record contracts recently won after contentious negotiations and U.S. labor strikes with General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler-parent Stellantis to assist in the union‚Äôs embattled organizing efforts elsewhere.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve created the threat of a good example, and now we‚Äôre going to build on it,‚Äù Fain said Thursday night when discussing Stellantis‚Äô tentative agreement. ‚ÄúWe just went on strike like we‚Äôve never been on strike before and won a historic contract as a result. Now we‚Äôre going to organize like we‚Äôve never organized before.‚Äù  Doing so would greatly assist the union‚Äôs bargaining efforts and membership, which has been nearly halved from roughly 700,000 members in 2001 to 383,000 at the beginning of this year. UAW membership peaked at 1.5 million in 1979.  The UAW has previously failed to organize foreign-based automakers in the U.S. Most recently, plants with Volkswagen and Nissan Motor fell short of the support needed to unionize. The UAW has previously discussed organizing Tesla‚Äôs Fremont plant in California with little to no traction in those efforts.  It remains to be seen whether the recent efforts are gaining traction at any other automakers, but Fain has vowed to move beyond the ‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù ‚Äî Ford, GM and Stellantis ‚Äî and expand to the ‚ÄúBig Five or Big Six‚Äù by the time its 4¬Ω-year contracts with the Detroit automakers expire in April 2028.  The deals include 25% wage increases that would boost top pay to more than $40 an hour, reinstatement of cost-of-living adjustments, enhanced profit-sharing payments and other significant pay, healthcare and workplace benefits. The contracts must still be ratified.  The union has already received significant interest from non-union automakers in light of the tentative agreements, Fain said. And last month, he rejected comments from Ford Chair Bill Ford arguing the company and union should be working together to battle non-American automakers.  ‚ÄúWorkers at Tesla, Toyota, Honda, and others are not the enemy ‚Äî they‚Äôre the UAW members of the future,‚Äù Fain said.   **Toyota**  Fain has taken particular aim at Toyota in recent days.  The automaker earlier this week confirmed plans to hike wages at its U.S. factories. The new rates would see hourly manufacturing employees at top rates in Kentucky receive roughly 9% pay increases to $34.80 an hour.  Fain on Thursday called that pay raise ‚Äúthe UAW bump,‚Äù joking that UAW stands for ‚ÄúU Are Welcome‚Äù to join the union‚Äôs movement.   ‚ÄúToyota isn‚Äôt giving out raises out of the goodness of their heart,‚Äù Fain said. ‚ÄúThey could have just as easily raised wages a month ago or a year ago. They did it now because the company knows we‚Äôre coming for ‚Äôem.‚Äù  Toyota, which has 49,000 hourly and salaried U.S. workers, said the ‚Äúdecision to unionize is ultimately made by our team members.‚Äù  ‚ÄúBy engaging in honest, two-way communication about what‚Äôs happening in the company, we aim to foster positive morale which ultimately leads to increased productivity,‚Äù the company said Friday in an emailed statement. ‚ÄúWorking together has provided a history of stable employment and income for our team members.‚Äù  **Tesla**  The UAW has so far not been able to establish enough support to force an organizing vote at Tesla‚Äôs facilities, including its Fremont, California, plant where the union previously represented workers when it was a GM-Toyota joint venture.  Fain on Thursday told Bloomberg News he believes organizing Tesla and taking on CEO Elon Musk is ‚Äúdoable.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe can beat anybody,‚Äù Fain told Bloomberg. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna come down to the people that work for him deciding if they want their fair share... or if they want him to fly himself to outer space at their expense.‚Äù  Still, Musk has historically clashed with union proponents.  As some workers sought to form a union at the company‚Äôs Fremont factory in in 2017 and 2018, Tesla was paying a consultancy named MWW PR to monitor employees in a Facebook group and on social media more broadly, as CNBC previously reported.  Tesla also terminated the employment of a union activist named Richard Ortiz in 2017. And in 2018, Musk said in a tweet, ‚ÄúNothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing?‚Äù  The tweet violated federal labor laws, the National Labor Relations Board later found.  An administrative court ordered Tesla to reinstate Ortiz and to have Musk delete his tweet, which it concluded had threatened workers‚Äô compensation. Tesla appealed the ruling, and Musk‚Äôs offending post remains on the social media platform which Musk now owns, has rebranded as X and runs as CTO and executive chairman.  In February, a different group of organizers filed a complaint with the NLRB claiming that Tesla had fired more than 30 employees at its Buffalo facility in retaliation for a union push there by Tesla Workers United. Tesla called the workers‚Äô allegations false, saying 4% of its Autopilot data labeling team in Buffalo had been terminated due to performance issues.  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency responsible for enforcing civil rights laws against workplace discrimination, sued Tesla in September, alleging widespread racist harassment of Black workers, and retaliation against those who spoke out.  And in late October, just over 100 of Tesla‚Äôs service employees in Sweden, members of the industrial labor group IF Metall, walked off the job for a short strike. Hundreds of mechanics and technicians at non-Tesla shops also agreed not to repair any of the EV makers‚Äô cars in solidarity. However, Tesla has so far refused to negotiate with IF Metall.  Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.,;,; 2023-11-04 11:52:13]
[How Much Is Tesla Worth? You Decide,;,; Wall Street Journal out with an article that lets you plug in 5 simple variables to get a valuation for Tesla.  The 5 variables are: how many cars Tesla sells in 2030, average selling price of a Tesla car in 2030 in today‚Äôs dollars, operating margin, cost of capital, and how much Tesla‚Äôs other operations are worth.  The Wall Street Journal has 4 pre-set scenarios:  1. Bearish - $58.5 billion valuation based on 5 million cars at $30k with 8% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $0 valuation for other operations besides cars  2. Default - $381 billion valuation based on 7 million cars at $30k with 10% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $200 billion valuation for other operations.  3. Bullish - $770 billion valuation based on 10 million cars at $30k with 12% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, $400 billion for other operations  4. Superfan - $2.33 trillion valuation based on 20 million cars at $30k with 15% operating margin, 8% cost of capital, $600 billion for other operations  Their assumptions are as follows:  &gt; Our model is based on estimates of Tesla‚Äôs future cash flows. It multiplies anticipated vehicle sales in 2030 by the average anticipated price to calculate revenue, and then applies the expected operating margin to arrive at operating profit. Estimates for the years before 2030 assume a smooth path in the variables from this year‚Äôs FactSet analyst consensus.  &gt; Operating profit is taxed at an 11% rate (FactSet consensus for Tesla in 2023). Cash flows are then calculated as posttax operating profit minus capital expenditures while adding back depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures are assumed to be a flat 7% of revenue and depreciation and amortization 20% of capital expenditures.  &gt; Estimated cash flows through 2030 are discounted back to their present value at the discount rate and aggregated. A terminal value is added to account for Tesla‚Äôs cash flows beyond 2030, assuming a steady-state growth rate of 5%. The total of all these discounted estimated cash flows gives the theoretical enterprise value of Tesla‚Äôs core automotive business now.  &gt; We have left the value of its other businesses as a separate assumption within the model to arrive at a total enterprise value. Market value would also include the company‚Äôs cash or debt position, which we have not modeled.  Personally, as a Tesla bull who owns the stock, I believe Tesla is worth north of $1 trillion based on 10 million cars at $38k and 17% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, and $200B for other operations. I also believe that assuming 5% terminal growth post 2030 is too low.   What do you think?  https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/how-much-is-tesla-worth-you-decide-78b25ab1,;,; 2023-09-28 15:06:02]

[My 58-year-old father put his entire 401k into Tesla stock. How do you explain the volatility risk and lack of diversification to a parent?,;,; Hi Reddit!  I've (30M) been stressed about my father's retirement savings ever since he told me he converted his entire savings from a normal target date fund to 100% Tesla stock. This occurred in 2020 around the same timeframe of the first stock split, and all contributions to date have been Tesla.  For background both my dad and I have loved the company and their products for years, but we differ in that I think the stock is heavily overpriced, and he has latched on to the valuations and extremely bullish forecasts people like Kathy Woods assign to Tesla. He's convinced the stock is going to rocket to 4 - 10X its current value before he retires, and hasn't really reacted to the bearish arguments I've laid out acknowledging how much more expensive the company is than every other automaker and how competition is increasing in the space. Not to mention that much of its valuation is currently highly speculative such as "robo-taxis" while their FSD is starting to fall behind competitors in execution and is still not (and may never be) fully delivered.  Setting the valuation of Tesla debate aside, I would never advise any person at any age to put 100% of their retirement portfolio in any single stock, let alone one as risky as Tesla. I've tried explaining the extreme risk in a zero diversity portfolio, where if this single company goes under he loses his entire retirement fund ("all your eggs are in one basket"), but he doesn't seem to take it seriously.  My fear is that he is already behind on where he probably should be in his retirement savings. He's told me before he spoke with a financial advisor before doing this, and he didn't have enough funds to manage with them. I feel he is making this gamble as he thinks its the only way to catch up, not recognizing he could also lose it all. I know he has not talked to any advisors since about his current investment strategy.  Some questions I'm hoping you can help answer for him and I, so he has an outside perspective:  If you are neutral or bearish on Tesla, how would you explain the issues and risks with its va;ue going forward?  If you are bullish on Tesla, are you investing 100% of your savings in it, and would you advise a 58-year-old to do the same with their retirement savings? Why or why not?  How would you explain the risk of his current plan to him, and what alternatives would you suggest?  What should an ideal retirement portfolio look like for someone his age?  What resources do you believe would be good to share with him that might help reopen the conversation on reducing his risk and impressing the importance of diversification?  It's not an easy conversation to have with a parent, and ultimately I respect that he's an adult who can do what he wants with his money. I've tried a few times to have it but its difficult to balance not being taken as condescending to your own father while explaining how insanely risky you think his financial decisions are. It's made it more difficult by the high upturns TSLA has taken in stretches, validating all his beliefs, but with the subsequent downturns he's doubled down and not acknowledged the volatility and risk. I fear with him consuming positive bullish Tesla content exclusively, he is not considering bearish outcomes or basic retirement savings advice. Any feedback from the community that can offer an alternative view would be highly appreciated, as I hope I can share some of your resources and opinions with him next time I retry this conversation.  Thanks so much!     EDIT: For those asking, I believe he got in at late August 2020 timeframe, around what is now the $120 - $140 price range.  He has averaged up basically ever since, so not clear on what the current average price is.  I think he is up now on original investment, but down on most continued contributions.,;,; 2023-03-08 15:44:04]

[Tesla Vs Competition,;,; First of all, I understand I may be beating a dead horse here, so I apologize. I also know Tesla is a highly polarizing stock to discuss. I have made money and lost money on Tesla in the past and I am currently trying to be as non-bias as possible and want to ensure I am understanding correctly.  As everyone knows, Tesla is priced at a dramatically higher price than it's competitors, with many saying it is all due to hype (which very well could be possible). From my understanding, although Tesla is involved in solar to some capacity, around 90+% of Tesla revenue comes from vehicle sales (I believe the number is 93% vehicle sales).   I do understand that Tesla was essentially "the first" big name in electric vehicles, giving them a first mover advantage. Anecdotally, I see an insane number of them on the road compared to any other EV. However, most auto makers are moving into the EV space. Based on online reviews I have read, other automakers vehicles are more reliable and better in a lot of areas comparatively to Tesla.   Additionally, I have heard of Tesla having long standing quality control issues. To my knowledge, the model 3 is the most affordable electric EV with the technology currently available, but even that has some issues, such as "full self driving" not really being full self driving and most competitors having similar systems that can do most of what the FSD can do.  I do find Tesla as a whole very fascinating (if anything, as a case study of how quick a company can grow and to the level it has). In a way, I really want Tesla to win and be this awesome, futuristic if you will, vehicle unlike anything we have seen. I was a Tesla bull for a long time, but recently have been thinking deeper into this and now trying be as unbiased as possible. I have learned more about competitors and pushes further doubts into my mind. I have heard really terrific things about the Mach E Mustang for example, with it beating Tesla in several categories, just as one example here.  With that said, what is the unbiased bull and bear case for Tesla? What is a genuine reason it can be priced so much higher than it's competitors outside of hype, or is it just that, hype? Is the first mover advantage just being displayed to an insane level and it will surely not last?  I'm extremely curious as to everyone's opinions and what you have to say!

The Wall Street bank believes Dojo could add up to $500 billion to Tesla's enterprise value, primarily by accelerating the development of robotaxis and network services.

With tesla, they'll probably charge half that,  so let's say 15$ an hr.  People will be lending their cars out for robotaxi and tesla can supply their own cars too, but let's say people volunteer their tesla   If tesla takes a 50% cut, that's 7.50 an hr, let's say they operate for 12 hrs a day   Well go with Roughly 10,000 teslas roaming around SF giving rides   10,000 teslas giving rides for 12hrs a day at 7.50 an hr equates to about   300 mill in a year Roughly in net profit. Not bad for 1 city.    At that rate it's most likely going well,  so it'll be approved slowly around the country, so maybe 50 cities   Multiply 300 mil by 50, you have 16 bil in net profit which should raise marketcap by 160 to 300 bil  Oh and uber will most likely be doomed in the process as this is pretty much their core business.

[Why Is Tesla Prices Not Affected From Recalls?,;,; Hello!   I have started trading for about 6 months and I am always playing safe and trying to understand the trends.

Tesla stocks have not affected even though they had to recall 2M cars in US.  2. Apple had a significant drop when Chinese government blocked gov. employees using iPhones.

[WSJ - Detroit automakers entered labor talks at cost disadvantage to Tesla,;,; Tickers mentioned: GM, F, STLA, TSLA  * Meeting UAW's initial demand would increase total average hourly compensation from $66 to $136 an hour vs. $45 at Tesla, according to Wells Fargo.  They are asking for a 32-hour work week but annualized on a 40-hour week that would be approximately $283,000 in total compensation. * It would further widen Tesla's tremendous advantage in efficiency as legacy automakers try to steer a costly transition to a future away from carbon emitting gas vehicles. * A key difference in compensation is TSLA employees tend to get cheap options that can increase a lot in value if the stock moves up. * ‚ÄúThis is our generation‚Äôs defining moment,‚Äù Fain said late Thursday before the walkout. ‚ÄúThe money is there. The cause is righteous.‚Äù * ‚ÄúCompetition is code word for race to the bottom, and I‚Äôm not concerned about Elon Musk building more rocket ships so he can fly in outer space and stuff,‚Äù Fain told CNBC on-air Wednesday.  https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/uaw-strike-tesla-labor-costs-baf8b897  More than a day into the United Auto Workers strike against the Detroit automakers and one thing is clear: Elon Musk has already won.  And the billionaire tycoon isn‚Äôt even involved.   Musk won before the strike began early Friday. He won before negotiations started two months ago. From the get-go, General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler parent Stellantis were expected to spend more on wages because of the union‚Äôs pressure. The question is just how much of an increase, and so far their offers haven‚Äôt pleased the union, igniting this past week‚Äôs work stoppage.  **Whatever happens, more money surely will be spent. Any wage increase further advances Tesla‚Äôs already tremendous cost advantage in EVs over its older U.S. peers, which are contending with generations of legacy expenses while trying to steer a costly transition to electric from gas-powered vehicles.**  In March, Musk revealed plans to build on his advantage by setting a goal of slashing manufacturing costs for the automaker‚Äôs next-generation vehicles by 50%, an ambitious agenda that will depend upon advanced automation, savvy engineering and other changes.   The Tesla chief executive‚Äôs actions this year have shown how Tesla can take advantage of a lower cost structure to engage in price wars with rivals around the world to juice sales.  In July, Tesla reported second-quarter profit that rose 20% even after reducing prices. Around the same time, in the midst of steep losses from its electric vehicles, Ford said it would slow its EV production growth.   All of this is playing out as the UAW seeks more than what the Detroit automakers say they can afford and remain competitive. The companies have offered wage increases of varying sizes reaching as high as 20% over four years, while UAW President Shawn Fain countered with a mid-30% increase, down from a previous ask of at least 40%.   **The Detroit companies‚Äô labor costs, including wages and benefits, are estimated at an average of $66 an hour, according to industry data. That compares with $45 at Tesla, which isn‚Äôt unionized and was founded 20 years ago. Meeting all of Fain‚Äôs initial demands would boost average hourly labor costs to $136 for the Detroit companies, Wells Fargo estimated.**  A key difference between Tesla‚Äôs compensation plan and that of the UAW workers revolves around company upside. UAW workers have been getting profit-sharing bonuses while Tesla workers receive stock options, which don‚Äôt have a direct cash cost to the company. Over the years, Tesla shares have risen like a rocket, though there have been periods of turbulence. Shares this year have more than doubled.  Fain argues that past contracts haven‚Äôt kept up with inflation, hurting the union‚Äôs roughly 146,000 auto workers‚Äô spending power, and that members‚Äô sacrifices have helped make the companies profitable in recent years.   **‚ÄúThis is our generation‚Äôs defining moment,‚Äù Fain said late Thursday before the walkout. ‚ÄúThe money is there. The cause is righteous.‚Äù**  Shortly afterward, Ford responded, saying the union‚Äôs demands would ‚Äúmore than double Ford‚Äôs current UAW-related labor costs, which are already significantly higher than the labor costs of Tesla, Toyota and other foreign-owned automakers in the United States that utilize non-union-represented labor.‚Äù  Many analysts, so far, are expecting that the Detroit companies will ultimately absorb the added costs. ‚ÄúThe much larger issue is that it adds incremental pressure to their already challenged transition to an EV world,‚Äù Dan Levy, an analyst for Barclays, cautioned investors in a recent note   Fain this past week sounded annoyed when asked about Tesla‚Äôs cost advantage.   ‚ÄúCompetition is code word for race to the bottom, and I‚Äôm not concerned about Elon Musk building more rocket ships so he can fly in outer space and stuff,‚Äù Fain told CNBC on-air Wednesday. ‚ÄúOur concern is working-class people need their share of economic justice in this world.‚Äù  Focus on the labor-cost gap is a classic part of Detroit negotiations‚Äîraised by executives, investors and analysts every cycle. Before Tesla, there was Toyota Motor and its nonunion pay rates.   U.S. automakers spent years arguing that Asian rivals, without UAW contracts, benefited from cheaper labor costs that allowed them to plow savings into cars that appealed to consumers.   Narrowing the labor-cost gap was a key part of the painful restructuring of the auto industry around 15 years ago, when union members made unprecedented concessions to help save their employers and their jobs.   Art Wheaton, a labor expert at Cornell University, suggests that the UAW‚Äôs ability to get higher wages could help put heat on Tesla during any renewed effort to organize there.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Elon Musk has all of that superwonderful, high-polished glow anymore,‚Äù he said, noting the controversies the billionaire has had regarding his recent ownership of Twitter-turned-X. ‚ÄúSome of that patina has been wiped clean.‚Äù  The UAW had its best shot in years to organize Tesla during labor strife in 2017 and 2018, when workers were feeling the burn of ‚Äúproduction hell‚Äù at what was then the automaker‚Äôs lone assembly plant outside San Francisco as it struggled with the Model 3 sedan.  But the organizing effort failed.  The National Labor Relations Board has ruled that Tesla violated U.S. labor law in its handling of the matter, including statements by Musk that were considered threatening when he tweeted that hourly workers would lose stock options if they joined the UAW. An appeal by the company, which has denied wrongdoing, is pending.   Musk has suggested that employee stock options make his factory workers the highest compensated in the industry, saying ‚Äúquite a few‚Äù line workers have become ‚Äúmillionaires over the years from company stock grants.‚Äù Options allow workers to buy stock at a certain price after working at the company for a set amount of time.   At Tesla, the average pay for a manufacturing technician can range from $23 to $32 an hour, according to estimates by Glassdoor. Tesla advertises factory jobs in California with expected pay ranging from $24 to $67 an hour plus cash and stock awards and other benefits.   On Thursday, Musk took another jab at the UAW, after essentially daring the union last year to try again to organize his workers, boasting that his factories ‚Äúhave a great vibe.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe encourage playing music and having some fun. Very important for people to look forward to coming to work!‚Äù he tweeted recently. ‚ÄúWe pay more than the UAW btw, but performance expectations are also higher.‚Äù,;,; 2023-09-16 13:58:38]
[Why Tesla is losing its EV dominance ?,;,;    Tesla ($TSLA) should be looking over its shoulder at the fully charged EVs barreling right toward its castle.  While Elon Musk's non-Twitter creation still has a stronghold on the EV market based on name recognition, market share, and production capabilities, the clear takeaway from this year‚Äôs New York International Auto Show (which Tesla was not a part of) is that traditional automakers such as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Nissan (NSANY) are all gunning for Tesla's dominance and lucrative profit margins.   ## Hyundai aims to lead the EV pack  ‚ÄúTesla who,‚Äù Hyundai Motor Americas CEO Randy Parker quipped when Yahoo Finance Live asked about Hyundai's IONIQ 6, an EV that was named 'Car of the Year' for 2023.  The impressive specs and pricing of Hyundai's IONIQ 6 places it in direct competition with Tesla's Model 3, the second-most-popular EV in the U.S. Hyundai's IONIQ 6 starts at $41,600 with a range of up to 240 miles. By comparison, the $41,990 Model 3 reaches 272 miles on one charge.  Gap closed.  ‚ÄúThe IONIQ 6 from a technology standpoint, you can‚Äôt do better,‚Äù Parker crowed.  And it‚Äôs that type of Tesla mentality that‚Äôs likely to test the EV leadership of Musk's EV outfit.  Older automakers known for their gas-powered rides are ramping up their push into the EV market with edgy new styles and attractive specs like those showcased at this year's New York Auto Show, including the Kia EV9, Nissan Ariya, Chevrolet Equinox EV, and Ram 1500 REV electric truck.  These will be added to a class of solid EVs already in the market like Ford's F-150 Lightning and Mach-E and the coming Chevy Silverado.  ## What's next for Tesla  Tesla's Cybertruck isn't even on the market yet. The company is reportedly working on a compact EV dubbed the Model 2, but it's unclear when that will arrive.   S&amp;P Global estimates the EV market will grow from just over 50 models today to 78 by year-end before more than doubling to 160 by the end of 2025.  S&amp;P Global Mobility‚Äôs Tom Libby told Yahoo Finance in a chat that "competitive pressure is pushing OEMs to move quickly,' and that Tesla's market share will ‚Äòkeep declining' as a result.  The inroads into Tesla's dominance are already being felt without question.  General Motors sold more than 20,000 EVs for the first time in a quarter, fueled by demand for its cheaper Chevy Bolt EV, which accounted for 95% of the auto giant‚Äôs EV sales. And according to GM, Bolt sales are expected to soar to reach 70,000 by the end of this year.  That may not sound too impressive when you compare it to Tesla‚Äôs record first-quarter delivery numbers, which totaled 422,875 globally. But data compiled by S&amp;P Global Mobility shows Tesla's competitors are gaining ground.   Tesla‚Äôs U.S. EV share subsequently fell from nearly three-quarters of the market in January 2022 to just over half in January 2023. Within that same time frame, General Motors' EV market share grew from 0.1% to 9.9%, and Ford‚Äôs foothold grew to 8.4%.  The pressure on Tesla is one of the factors forcing the carmaker to slash prices *again*. Tesla marked down its vehicles for the fifth time this year, its latest effort to boost demand and regain lost market share.  "In this EV arms race Tesla needs to defend their turf and customer base with price cuts," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in an email to Yahoo Finance. "Everyone is trying to catch up. Tesla cutting prices were the near-term pain for long-term gain strategic poker move."  RBC analyst Tom Narayan also thinks lower prices could help Tesla's demand issue, telling Yahoo Finance Live that lower prices are a "great way to really steal market share."  Despite some upbeat outlooks from Wall Street on price cuts and the fact Tesla's stock has been a favorite among investors since the start of the year, shares are still off more than 40% in the past 12 months. That's a much starker decline than competitors Ford and General Motors, with respective one-year drops of 14% and 10%.  The relative underperformance of Tesla's stock proves some investors are looking at its recent price cuts and quarterly delivery miss as a sign of trouble ahead for the electric vehicle maker. And perhaps a sign that mighty Tesla is losing its grip on an industry it has dominated for the last five years.,;,; 2023-04-13 10:36:18]
[Green stock selloff deepens as Tesla sentiment sours.,;,; The sell-off in green stocks is predicted to continue through 2024, marking a fourth consecutive year of losses, according to Bloomberg's Markets Live Pulse survey.         Negative sentiment is expected to impact various green asset classes, with Tesla potentially losing its top 10 position in the S&amp;P 500, as indicated by nearly two-thirds of respondents. The decline is attributed to high-interest rates, political backlash, and evolving regulations.         Sustainable investor Chat Renders sees this as a "watershed moment" due to speculation overshadowing traditional financial metrics. While respondents share short-term pessimism, there's a consensus on the need to protect portfolios from climate risk in the coming years.         Some experts view the selloff as a temporary shift, presenting buying opportunities in utility stocks. Despite challenges, the urgency of addressing climate change suggests a potential rebound in the long run, with two-thirds of respondents expecting climate change to impact portfolios over the next three years.    ,;,; 2023-11-27 10:22:13]

[Polestar is the latest EV maker to announce a move to Tesla‚Äôs North American charging standard,;,; https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/29/polestar-moves-to-tesla-charging-standard.html  Swedish electric vehicle maker Polestar said Thursday that it has signed a deal with Tesla that will allow drivers of its EVs to charge at about 12,000 Tesla charging stations in North America starting next year. New Polestar vehicles sold in North America will come standard with the Tesla-designed North American Charging Standard, or NACS, plug starting in 2025. Owners of existing Polestars will be able to charge at Tesla‚Äôs Supercharger stations with an adapter starting in mid-2024.  Polestar‚Äôs deal follows an identical one announced by corporate sibling Volvo Cars on Tuesday. Ford Motor, General Motors and Rivian have also announced similar deals with Tesla in recent weeks. ‚ÄúWe salute the pioneering work Tesla has done to speed up the adoption and increase the popularity of electric vehicles, and it‚Äôs great to see the Supercharger network being made available in this way,‚Äù said CEO Thomas Ingenlath. ‚ÄúThis move will greatly increase the rate of EV adoption in a key automotive region.‚Äù  Most non-Tesla EVs and charging stations in North America use a plug design called CCS, which stands for Combined Charging System. Recent studies have found that CCS charging networks have much lower reliability than Tesla‚Äôs network. Critics have also noted that the CCS fast-charging plug is significantly larger and heavier than the NACS plug, making it difficult for some older or disabled drivers to use.   Tesla EVs can use CCS chargers with an adapter, but currently only Tesla EVs can use Tesla chargers. Tesla‚Äôs plug design was proprietary until November, when the company published the technical details of its system and made it available to other automakers and makers of EV chargers.,;,; 2023-06-29 14:51:50]

[Tesla Drops 3% After Price Cuts Announced in China,;,; [https://tokenist.com/tesla-drops-3-after-price-cuts-announced-in-china/](https://tokenist.com/tesla-drops-3-after-price-cuts-announced-in-china/)     Tesla is implementing significant price reductions for its vehicles in China, following a substantial 31% drop in sales for July from the previous month. To counter the downturn in the world's largest automotive market, Tesla has trimmed the starting prices of its China-made Model Y long-range and performance models by 14,000 yuan (around $1,900), a reduction of 4.5% and 3.8% respectively. Additionally, the automaker will offer insurance subsidies of 8,000 yuan for entry-level, real-wheel-drive versions of Model 3 cars, available between Aug. 14 and Sept. 30.        The move comes amidst a broader global decrease in demand for electric vehicles, and local competitors such as BYD regaining market share with more favorable pricing. Sales of Tesla‚Äôs China-made cars have been on a decline since the end of 2022, although the automaker did see a 31% year-over-year increase in sales in China in February 2023.        Despite the decline in China, Tesla's global vehicle deliveries in Q2 2023 hit a record high of 466,100 units, a quarter-over-quarter increase of about 10.23%.

[A Lamborghini-Style EV: BYD Goes Upmarket to Outmaneuver Tesla,;,; * [Yangwang, a BYD brand, makes an electric vehicle that resembles a Lamborghini.](https://images.wsj.net/im-915094?width=780&amp;size=1.4988290398126465&amp;pixel_ratio=1.5)  * [BYD vs. Tesla market share.](https://i.imgur.com/oP0EnLO.png)   Chinese automaker expands its electric-vehicle lineup to more than 20 models in its push overseas and into higher price brackets  https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/a-lamborghini-style-ev-byd-goes-upmarket-to-outmaneuver-tesla-2b698578  HONG KONG‚Äî BYD overtook TSLA as the world‚Äôs top electric-vehicle seller by pumping out a range of affordable cars that gave Chinese drivers what they wanted: choice.   Now it is moving into the luxury market as it prepares to take on the world.  BYD is releasing the cars under a different brand, Yangwang, marking a strategy shift from relying on lower-priced runarounds to producing less conventional vehicles that come with a hefty price tag. They include a $150,000 supercar that resembles a Lamborghini and an SUV that it says can rotate 360 degrees on the spot and float in water‚Äîfeatures that turn heads in China‚Äôs cutthroat car market where buyers chase the latest smart technology.  Tesla, meanwhile, banks on continuing strong global demand mostly for its Model 3 and Model Y cars, which it refreshed last year. Tesla‚Äôs Cybertruck, its first release in years, isn‚Äôt available in China, though the automaker is planning to take the vehicle on a roadshow in the country.  In China, the world‚Äôs biggest EV market, Tesla‚Äôs market share has been shrinking: BYD now sells five cars to every one that the U.S. automaker does. BYD‚Äôs popularity has surged as it cranks out new and varied models at a rapid pace, growing its portfolio of electric vehicles to more than two dozen models, catering to almost every taste and budget.   Backed by Warren Buffett, BYD has become so dominant in its home market that sales in the country enabled it to dethrone Elon Musk‚Äôs automaker as the bestselling global EV brand last quarter.  BYD also has ambitious export and expansion plans. BYD has topped EV sales charts in Thailand and is quickly rising in markets including Australia and Israel. It is building factories in Brazil, Hungary and Thailand. Its first chartered cargo ship with a capacity for 7,000 vehicles set sail for Europe this month.  Whether BYD can repeat its home success on the global stage depends on whether it can translate the formula winning over Chinese buyers to international consumers. In the U.S., South Korean carmakers Hyundai Motor and Kia are emerging as Tesla‚Äôs biggest competition by offering a broader range of vehicles.  Challenges loom large for BYD as Chinese carmakers face pressure on profit margins at home, deal with a subsidy probe in Europe, and remain largely shut out from the U.S., where BYD has long had ambitions to sell passenger EVs.   Beyond existing U.S. tariffs on Chinese cars, the Inflation Reduction Act will exclude cars made with Chinese components from EV tax credits. For now, the company has been manufacturing and selling buses and trucks in the U.S. Its current strategy is to focus on commercial vehicles in the U.S., a company spokeswoman said.   **Export ambition**  BYD expects to export 400,000 cars abroad this year, a goal that is achievable, said CMB International analyst Ji Shi. Exports offering higher profit margins are likely to become the next engine of growth for BYD, HSBC analysts wrote in a note earlier this month.   BYD has yet to make much progress toward its main prize: Europe. BYD is estimated to have sold around 13,000 cars in the European Union last year, far from Tesla‚Äôs 270,000, according to figures compiled by data firm GlobalData.   In China, BYD held almost 12% of the passenger-car market and Tesla under 3% for the first 11 months of last year, according to figures compiled by GlobalData. Tesla was the market leader in electric vehicles four years ago. While Tesla‚Äôs Model Y remained the most popular electric car in China last year, BYD claimed half of the nation‚Äôs 20 bestselling electric models as it churned out new minivans and sedans.  BYD ‚Äúhas the China market completely covered for the most part,‚Äù said Tu Le, consultant at Sino Auto Insights.  This month, Tesla cut prices in China for some versions of the Model 3 and Model Y, the latest fluctuation over the past year as carmakers engage in a price war in China. Tesla‚Äôs refresh of its Models 3 and Y last year added new features such as ambient interior lighting and a smaller rear screen, features that analysts said were already common among Chinese EVs and might not move the needle for Tesla.    Tesla didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment.  While Tesla has fended off past challenges from a range of Chinese automakers, BYD‚Äôs move upmarket presents drivers with more prestigious homegrown choices over foreign rivals.  A price tag of 150,000 yuan, equivalent to around $21,000, used to be the ceiling customers were thought to be prepared to pay for Chinese-branded vehicles, a BYD executive said. Customers flaunted their status with an imported Western vehicle as there were no Chinese-designed cars priced above a million yuan, BYD sales representatives said.  **Delivery ceremonies**  Yangwang luxury vehicles are sold through direct-sales showrooms separate to BYD. Customers picking up their vehicles are offered a delivery ceremony, complete with balloons and floral decorations for special occasions such as a birthday, marriage proposals or anniversaries.   Buyers of its hybrid U8 SUV have the car key delivered in a gift box, nested with a miniature of the vehicle. BYD videos show the U8 doing a full 360-degree ‚Äútank turn‚Äù on the spot, which has garnered a lot of attention on Chinese social media.   Jin Songchang, a Chinese businessman, was shopping for an off-road SUV to drive across China‚Äôs vast provinces once he retires. After months of test driving luxury foreign cars, he finally whipped out a deposit for BYD‚Äôs U8, which costs just over $150,000.   Jin said he was swayed to BYD after company founder Wang Chuanfu said at its launch event that the U8 can run steadily on just three wheels if a tire bursts, thanks to its four powerful in-wheel motors. Jin placed a deposit the next day.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always appreciated foreign brands more. BYD is the first one I decided to buy on the spot,‚Äù added Jin, who said he owns many cars.  Together with its other two high-end car brands, BYD counted more than 135,500 orders of premium and luxury cars in 2023, according to company data. The U8 SUV will be available in Brazil, the company said last year.    BYD has yet to open up sales for its supercar, the U9, after it was revealed at the Shanghai Auto Show in April. The sports car can accelerate from 0 to 62 miles in two seconds. This month, Yangwang teased its coming luxury sedan.  BYD is following the footsteps of companies such as General Motors, Ford and Volkswagen with its family of different car brands, analysts say.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no global automaker that just sells one brand, outside of Tesla,‚Äù said Le, the consultant.,;,; 2024-01-22 22:45:24]

Exxon is one of several oil and gas companies seeking to expand into lithium production to take advantage of surging demand for use in electric-vehicle batteries, and as a way of diversifying beyond fossil fuels. The talks with potential customers are still early stage, and the company has yet to lay out its plans for potential lithium operations.

Exxon, SK On and Volkswagen declined to comment. Tesla, Ford and Samsung didn‚Äôt reply to messages seeking comment.  The rapid global roll out of electric vehicles has raised the risk of bottlenecks and shortages for key battery materials like lithium, sparking a rush to invest in and secure supply. The world will need nearly 60 new lithium mines and plants to feed the growing demand for the shift away from fossil fuels, according to researcher Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, and more lithium will be required in 2030 than was mined between 2015 and 2022.,;,; 2023-08-01 00:06:58]
[Cathie Wood has a blunt warning about Tesla's stock over the coming months,;,; Ark Invest, a firm known for its bullish stance on Elon Musk and Tesla, believes that Tesla is well-positioned to dominate the self-driving cars and robotaxi fleet industry, which it anticipates could be worth up to $10 trillion by 2030. In April, Ark projected that Tesla's stock could reach $2,000 per share by 2027. Despite weak quarterly earnings and falling gross margins, Ark remains confident in Tesla's potential due to its focus on robotaxis.  However, Ark has been reducing its Tesla holdings in recent months, even as the stock experiences volatility. Their flagship Innovation ETF owned around 3.5 million Tesla shares in June, but by October 23, that number had fallen to 2.6 million shares, valued at $549.8 million. Despite this, Cathie Wood, Ark's CEO and investment lead, is still optimistic about their Tesla holdings.  Wood explained that Ark sells Tesla shares when the stock outperforms and reinvests in stocks with short-term concerns or significant underperformance relative to Tesla. They aim to increase their Tesla holdings during periods of stock underperformance.  Wood is also looking forward to the release of the Cybertruck in November, but she acknowledges potential near-term challenges and controversy, particularly related to profitability and scaling. Musk has indicated that the Cybertruck might not be profitable until scaling issues are addressed, which could take up to 18 months.

[On Tesla's valuation (Part 5),;,; In the past I've made multiple posts on Tesla's valuation ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/qj07jj/on_teslas_valuation/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u8ka1h/on_teslas_valuation_part_deux/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/y8sdc4/on_teslas_valuation_part_trois/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/10sk1gh/on_teslas_valuation_part_4/)).  -----------------  **Sales**  Last time I lowered my bear case for 2023 to 1.7M, with 2.15M sales expected and 2.4M in the bull case. With 889K cars sold in H1 and the announced retooling for the Model 3 refresh, I expect them to comfortably exceed my bear case, but believe the bull case needs to lowered to 2.2M for an expected amount of sales of 1.95M for the full year. With the slightly slower ramp in Texas and Berlin, the slower than expected rollout of the Cybertruck and Mexico only coming online by the end of 2024 at the earliest, I will also lower the bull cases for 2024 and 2025 from 3.4M and 4.8M respectively:  ||Bear Case|Bull Case| :--|:--|:--|:--| |**2023**|1,800,000|2,200,000| |**2024**|2,400,000|3,000,000| |**2025**|3,000,000|4,400,000|  **ASP**  I expected Tesla to decrease ASPs from $54,385 to ~$51K in 2023. With ASPs of $46,379 in H1, and although I expect ASPs to be higher in H2, I will also lower my expectations here to $47K.  I then expect ASPs to increase to $49K in 2024 and then start to decline with the introduction of the compact car, starting with $48K in 2025.  **Revenue**  Based on the ASPs and delivery numbers, the new expected automotive revenues would come down to:  ||Bear Case|Bull Case| :--|:--|:--| |**2023**|$85B|$103B| |**2024**|$118B|$144B| |**2025**|$144B|$211B|  As for non-automotive revenue, I will leave my expectations unchanged:  ||Bear Case|Bull Case| :--|:--|:--| |**2023**|$16B|$24B| |**2024**|$22B|$40B| |**2025**|$30B|$60B|  **Operating Margin**  Despite IRA battery credits (starting in March), cheaper commodity prices, increasing economies of scale (especially in Berlin and Texas), operating margin came out significantly lower than I expected at ~10.5%. I will therefor lower my margin expectations for both the bear and bull cases.  ||Bear Case|Bull Case| :--|:--|:--| |**2023**|8%|13%| |**2024**|10%|16%| |**2025**|12%|20%|  **Net Income**  Multiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:  ||Bear Case|Bull Case| :--|:--|:--| |**2023**|$8.1B|$16.5B| |**2024**|$14.0B|$29.4B| |**2025**|$20.9B|$54.2B|  **P/E**  After the incredible gains this year so far, the current $822B market cap divided by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:  ||Bear Case|Bull Case| :--|:--|:--| |**2023**|101|50| |**2024**|59|28| |**2025**|39|15|  **PEG**  This would translate into the following PEG ratings:  ||Bear Case|Bull Case| :--|:--|:--| |**2023**|N/A|1.61| |**2024**|0.72|0.36| |**2025**|0.79|0.18|  ------------------------------  **The conclusion**  It was obvious to anyone able to do a basic financial analysis that Tesla was oversold at $108, but I heavily underestimated the effects rising interest rates would have on Tesla's ASPs and by extension margins. While Tesla looks set to easily maintain their target growth of 50% on annual unit sales, their revenues will grow at a lower pace and net income will even be largely flat this year before resuming growth.  Despite all that and the increase in stock price since my last analysis, the PE and PEG ratios show Tesla is still undervalued in the long term. Assuming growth would flatten to ~30% after 2025, Tesla would still need to grow at least 2x for the valuation to be in line with other big tech companies. That said, the opportunity has come down a very large amount since my last evaluation and although I disagree, there is now a reasonable argument to be made that Tesla is no longer a no-brainer investment that every long term investor should have in their portfolio.,;,; 2023-08-04 11:09:59]
[I can't invest in Tesla because it cannot have the growth investors think they will have,;,; Look, I'm a very regular investors, I'm far below any of you guys, but I'm a software engineers and I know well the industry and I worked with a lot of ex-tesla employees.  I'm very bullish on their charging network grid, i'm ok with their car line-up, but when it comes to their growth with project like AI, self-driving, if they have not completed 50% of the work so far, from now on, any new tech project at Tesla will go nowhere unless they are extremely lucky.  There is 1 reason for that, Tesla can not hire software engineers talent. It's not a new thing, Tesla is well known for:  1. Compensation below industry average leader 2. No work-life balance 3. No job security  Any talented software engineer good enough to receive an offer from one of the leader in the tech industry, will never choose Tesla over other offers.  What has saved Tesla until 2022/2023, was the Elon factor.  But now, love or hate it, this Elon factor is no there anymore, a software engineer will request one of the top 3 above.  I understand it will take a while before it becomes well known that Tesla cant give the growth they pretend they will have, it can take 5 years, a decade, because Elon is a good bullshiter, but it will come.,;,; 2023-07-20 17:14:54]

[Tesla recalls nearly all vehicles sold in US to fix system that monitors drivers using Autopilot,;,; DETROIT (AP) ‚Äî Tesla is recalling nearly all vehicles sold in the U.S., more than 2 million, to update software and fix a defective system that‚Äôs supposed to ensure drivers are paying attention when using Autopilot.        Documents posted Wednesday by U.S. safety regulators say the update will increase warnings and alerts to drivers and even limit the areas where basic versions of Autopilot can operate.        The recall comes after a two-year investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into a series of crashes that happened while the Autopilot partially automated driving system was in use. Some were deadly.        The agency says its investigation found Autopilot‚Äôs method of making sure that drivers are paying attention can be inadequate and can lead to ‚Äúforeseeable misuse of the system.‚Äù  The added controls and alerts will ‚Äúfurther encourage the driver to adhere to their continuous driving responsibility,‚Äù the documents said.        But safety experts said while the recall is a good step, it still makes the driver responsible and doesn‚Äôt fix the underlying problem that Tesla‚Äôs automated systems have trouble spotting and stopping for obstacles in their path.        The recall covers models Y, S, 3 and X produced between Oct. 5, 2012, and Dec. 7 of this year. The update was to be sent to certain affected vehicles on Tuesday, with the rest getting it later.        Autopilot includes features called Autosteer and Traffic Aware Cruise Control, with Autosteer intended for use on limited access freeways when it‚Äôs not operating with a more sophisticated feature called Autosteer on City Streets.        The software update will limit where Autosteer can be used. ‚ÄúIf the driver attempts to engage Autosteer when conditions are not met for engagement, the feature will alert the driver it is unavailable through visual and audible alerts, and Autosteer will not engage,‚Äù the recall documents said.        Depending on a Tesla‚Äôs hardware, the added controls include ‚Äúincreasing prominence‚Äù of visual alerts, simplifying how Autosteer is turned on and off, and additional checks on whether Autosteer is being used outside of controlled access roads and when approaching traffic control devices. A driver could be suspended from using Autosteer if they repeatedly fail ‚Äúto demonstrate continuous and sustained driving responsibility,‚Äù the documents say.        According to recall documents, agency investigators met with Tesla starting in October to explain ‚Äútentative conclusions‚Äù about the fixing the monitoring system. Tesla did not concur with NHTSA‚Äôs analysis but agreed to the recall on Dec. 5 in an effort to resolve the investigation.        Auto safety advocates for years have been calling for stronger regulation of the driver monitoring system, which mainly detects whether a driver‚Äôs hands are on the steering wheel. They have called for cameras to make sure a driver is paying attention, which are used by other automakers with similar systems.        Philip Koopman, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University who studies autonomous vehicle safety, called the software update a compromise that doesn‚Äôt address a lack of night vision cameras to watch drivers‚Äô eyes, as well as Teslas failing to spot and stop for obstacles.        ‚ÄúThe compromise is disappointing because it does not fix the problem that the older cars do not have adequate hardware for driver monitoring,‚Äù Koopman said.        Koopman and Michael Brooks, executive director of the nonprofit Center for Auto Safety, contend that crashing into emergency vehicles is a safety defect that isn‚Äôt addressed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not digging at the root of what the investigation is looking at,‚Äù Brooks said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not answering the question of why are Teslas on Autopilot not detecting and responding to emergency activity?‚Äù        Koopman said NHTSA apparently decided that the software change was the most it could get from the company, ‚Äúand the benefits of doing this now outweigh the costs of spending another year wrangling with Tesla.‚Äù        In its statement Wednesday, NHTSA said the investigation remains open ‚Äúas we monitor the efficacy of Tesla‚Äôs remedies and continue to work with the automaker to ensure the highest level of safety.‚Äù        Autopilot can steer, accelerate and brake automatically in its lane, but is a driver-assist system and cannot drive itself despite its name. Independent tests have found that the monitoring system is easy to fool, so much that drivers have been caught while driving drunk or even sitting in the back seat.        In its defect report filed with the safety agency, Tesla said Autopilot‚Äôs controls ‚Äúmay not be sufficient to prevent driver misuse.‚Äù        A message was left early Wednesday seeking further comment from the Austin, Texas, company.        Tesla says on its website that Autopilot and a more sophisticated Full Self Driving system are meant to help drivers who have to be ready to intervene at all times. Full Self Driving is being tested by Tesla owners on public roads.        In a statement posted Monday on X, formerly Twitter, Tesla said safety is stronger when Autopilot is engaged.        NHTSA has dispatched investigators to 35 Tesla crashes since 2016 in which the agency suspects the vehicles were running on an automated system. At least 17 people have been killed.        The investigations are part of a larger probe by the NHTSA into multiple instances of Teslas using Autopilot crashing into emergency vehicles. NHTSA has become more aggressive in pursuing safety problems with Teslas, including a recall of Full Self Driving software.        In May, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whose department includes NHTSA, said Tesla shouldn‚Äôt be calling the system Autopilot because it can‚Äôt drive itself.,;,; 2023-12-13 15:45:04]
[Hertz Wants to Sell 20,000 EVs Amid Low Rental Demand, High Repair Prices,;,; Just over two years after announcing plans to purchase 100,000 Teslas and another 65,000 electric cars from Polestar for its rental fleets, Hertz is planning to sell off 20,000 of its EVs, according to a federal regulatory filing posted Thursday. The rental company noted the high cost of collision repairs and lower demand from consumers as the primary drivers for the EV divestment. Hertz, in turn, plans to use some of the income from those sales to purchase more new gas-powered vehicles.  The electric rental demand issue may have less to do with the cars themselves and more to do with the unique traits of EVs. An average renter is looking for a car that will get them around over the course of a trip rather than a compelling experience in that car. For those customers, the complexities of an EV may prove to be more of a frustration than a charm.  Renting a Tesla Model 3, for instance, comes with all the frustrations of the screen-heavy Tesla user interface without any of the time to get used to those adjustments that a buyer would have. Charging is an even bigger issue: Not only do consumers without EV experience who rent a Polestar 2 or a Tesla Model 3 have to figure out how to charge a car while on the road, they also have to figure out two completely different charging ecosystems depending on which car they get.  Even though Hertz plans to offload much of its electric fleet, the company says it "will continue to execute its strategy around EV mobility and offer customers a wide selection of vehicles," according to the filing. Hertz says it will grow its charging infrastructure, work closer with electric car manufacturers to lower parts and labor costs, and continue to help educate customers about EVs.  Hertz currently lists 548 Tesla Model 3s and zero Polestar models on its direct sales website. The most affordable Teslas are currently selling for just over $20,000, but screenshots shared by Electrek on Wednesday suggest that other Model 3s have previously been listed for as low as $17,700 before a potential tax credit for used EVs.  https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a46353518/hertz-wants-to-sell-20000-evs-amid-low-rental-demand-high-repair-prices/,;,; 2024-01-13 07:59:27]
[Tesla just turned a huge financial burden into a $12.9 billion revenue opportunity.,;,; * Tesla recently added two of the world's largest carmakers to its EV charging network. * Just weeks later, more automobile manufacturers are making -- or considering -- the move.  * Some investors are viewing this as an opportunity comparable to Amazon's rollout of AWS.  #  The electric vehicle maker might be having an "AWS moment."  The past couple of years have been a bumpy ride for Tesla (TSLA). After rocketing to an all-time high in late 2021, the stock plunged more than 70% in the face of high inflation, rising interest rates, and the worst stock market downturn in more than a decade. But the tide appears to have turned over the past several months. Since bottoming in early January, Tesla shares have been on fire, gaining 149% as of this writing.   What caused this epic run? A rebound in the stock market and the recovering economy were no doubt contributors, but the biggest gains have come over the past few weeks in the wake of a few historic announcements. Several big-name automakers have ceded the high ground, joining the Tesla Supercharger network and adopting its North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector, which is now on the road to becoming the industry standard on the continent.   This stampede of partnerships prompts the question: Is Tesla having an "AWS moment"?  # The agreements driving Tesla stock higher   Late last month, Ford announced that beginning early next year, Ford electric vehicle (EV) owners would gain access to more than 12,000 Tesla charging stations across the U.S. Ford's chief customer officer, Marin Gjaja, cited Tesla's "large, reliable and efficient charging system" as the incentive.        Just weeks later, General Motors announced that it, too, would join the Tesla Supercharger network. On Tuesday, Rivian jumped on the bandwagon, joining the company's North American network, while Hyundai is considering a similar move.   In each case, the automakers have noted that after initially requiring an adapter, they would equip future EVs with an NACS charge port within the next couple of years, eliminating the need for adapters going forward.  #   The cloud connection   Back in 2000, Amazon (AMZN) was hamstrung by a number of growth-related issues, the biggest being the ability to scale its nascent operations. To address this challenge, the company developed a cloud infrastructure system that would form the foundation for its growing e-commerce business.        At the time -- and unbeknownst to Amazon executives -- the company had planted the seeds that would eventually become Amazon Web Services (AWS), its lucrative cloud computing service. After being used solely by Amazon employees for several years, the service debuted to the public in early 2006, and the company began renting out the cloud infrastructure it originally developed for in-house use. And the rest -- as they say -- is history.         AWS quickly become one of Amazon's most lucrative enterprises, a paradigm that continues to this day. In 2022, AWS generated revenue of more than $80 billion, up 29% year over year. More importantly, the cloud computing business was responsible for just 15% of Amazon's total revenue but all of its operating income -- even subsidizing the losses from its e-commerce operations.   The company is still the leader in the cloud business it pioneered, closing out the first quarter with a 32% share of the cloud infrastructure market, which is as much as the shares of Microsoft and Alphabet combined, according to data supplied by research firm Canalys.         The parallel here is clear. Tesla originally developed the Supercharger network solely for use by its customers, but it appears to be transforming into a lucrative industry standard.  # AWS moment?   The ability to take a substantial business costs and turn them into a hefty revenue generator is a rare thing, which is why some are calling this Tesla's "AWS moment." Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is one such commentator. He notes that while the company is known for accelerating EV adoption around the globe, Tesla's Supercharger network is the hidden gem that will take the company -- and its stock -- to the next level:         I believe "what has changed" for the Street over the last month is the recognition with the Ford and GM supercharger partnerships that Tesla's sum-of-the-parts valuation is now finally starting to get tapped into. This reminds us of when the Street started to realize the margin story and valuation at AWS for Amazon.        He goes on to estimate that the pacts with Ford and GM could add another $3 billion to Tesla's EV charging revenue "over the next few years."        Piper Sandler agrees and is more precise in its estimates, estimating that charging from non-Tesla customers could add $3 billion to revenue by 2030, surging to $5.4 billion by 2032. A greater number of EVs on the road -- from numerous automakers -- will no doubt accelerate this "flywheel effect," enriching Tesla and its shareholders along the way.         The company is also vying for roughly $7.5 million in subsidies offered by the Biden administration to expand its Supercharger network if other automakers have access to its system. In all, this amounts to nearly $13 billion in additional financial incentives for Tesla to open up its network.         It's also worth noting that Tesla also has a significant advantage over its rivals with one of the most cost-effective chargers in the business. The company has been able to construct charging stations for as little as $42,000 per connector, compared to a range of $100,000 to $250,000 for its rivals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tesla can use the additional funds from non-Tesla customers to expand its Supercharger network, further fueling the flywheel.         While it's still early days for these charging collaborations, this could eventually be a big revenue generator for Tesla.  #  The fine print   As previously noted, Tesla's stock price has soared this year -- up nearly 50% in the past month alone -- as a result of the recent announcements, with a commensurate increase in its valuation. The stock currently has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 77 and sells for over eight times forward sales -- a lofty valuation by any measure. For context, analysts expect the company to grow revenue by 22% and 29%, respectively, in 2023 and 2024. Value investors will no doubt balk at the stock's hefty price tag.        That said, Tesla is the undisputed leader in the U.S. EV market and is just beginning to flex its charging station muscles. If the company eventually adopts a similar strategy for batteries and energy storage solutions, Tesla's recent gains could be just the beginning for those with a long-term outlook.    ,;,; 2023-06-26 09:32:17]
[Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..),;,; From https://www.investors.com/news/nasdaq-100-plans-special-rebalance-to-curb-dominance-of-magnificent-seven/    The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the "magnificent seven" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.  The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.  The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to "address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights."  The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.  The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.   How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted? The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.  The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.  The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.  Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.  Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.  Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.  Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.  Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.  How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut? Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.  Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.  The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.  Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023 The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.  This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.  There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.  Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices? The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.  However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&amp;P 500, which is why S&amp;P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.  The S&amp;P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.  Most of the "magnificent 7" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.  The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.  Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.,;,; 2023-07-10 20:25:37]
[Tesla. Is it a good investment now?,;,; Tesla is the largest EV manufacturer in the world. Many think this blue ship stock is like money in the bank. You buy the stock and keep it for 5 years . This expectation may be misleading and you may lose a lot . Why? 1- EPS is at 3.48 and share price is $164. This shows share price is too high. Overvalued. 2- Trailing P/E is a staggering 45, and forward P/E is 42, another high number 3-Margins: their operating margin was 27% and now it is 14.82% 4- Last quarter it cut prices three times. Cutting prices is not a simple policy because once you cut prices expect your competitors to do the same, or even worse. Now Chinese manufacturers are enjoying higher sales. This trend will continue especially that China has removed COVID restriction.  Chinese manufacturers like BYD , Nio and xpev are also expanding their client base to Europe.  Chinese manufacturers are able to compete and surpass Tesla because of the Chinese government financial support, something Tesla doesn‚Äôt and will not have. Tesla stock was $164 at the close last week. For me, Tesla has all the indications of going lower. Maybe around $130.  What are your thought? Do you still believe Tesla will reach the moon?

Or I could sell now for $53, or ride it out and risk the $100 for $2700.   My portfolio can handle a moderate amount of risk. As long as I buy out the short side first and sell the long side before it absolutely dies, losing 3k wouldn't be the end of the world. More just like my 1 stupid gamble for 2023/4  What say you?,;,; 2023-09-26 00:05:42]
[TESLA will Cyber Truck sell well and move share price to a new all time high?,;,; Have to be honest with you I don‚Äôt currently have a position in Tesla. But I am intrigued about what I‚Äôm hearing regarding the release of the cyber truck. Evidently they have a lot of orders currently with big deposits, along with a backlog of 1,900,000 orders waiting to be filled with a late 2023 or early 2024 release date.   According to this article, that is a five-year backlog.    ‚ÄúTesla Cybertruck Orders Surpass 1.9 Million, 5 Year Wait Times‚Äù   There are now over 1.9 million orders for the long-awaited Tesla Cybertruck, per a crowd-sourced data tracker. Speaking on an Earnings Call earlier this week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated that demand for the Cybertruck is "so off the hook, you can‚Äôt even see the hook.‚Äù  Given that Tesla plans to produce 375,000 Cybertrucks a year at peak capacity, new orders will technically take around 5 years to arrive.   It seems to me that Tesla would be a great place to jump in if it falls to $200 per share.  I don‚Äôt see it going much lower than $200.00   Recent history: 52 week history $101.81 low and $313.00 high.    https://insideevs.com/news/678191/tesla-cybertruck-orders-5-year-wait-times/amp/,;,; 2023-08-22 02:19:20]
[What‚Äôs going on with Volkswagen?,;,; The stock keeps sinking, and even one year ago I was happy to buy it at a discounted price, but it keeps going down, and I‚Äôm becoming less and less proud for the deal I‚Äôve got.  It doesn‚Äôt make sense. PE ratio is good, and it‚Äôs the second largest in the world in car sales.  You could say sales are declining, but so does Ford‚Äôs (even more), but it didn‚Äôt tank that much.  They keep manufacturing a very diversified range of cars from cheap boring to supercars (indirectly through child brands, but still), and even though its sales isn‚Äôt expected to be growing as much as Tesla, but comparing the two is still a joke, and in my opinion Tesla will never be even close to sales of Volkswagen. Still, Tesla‚Äôs valuation is 10x Volkswagens.  I don‚Äôt mean to start comparing the two, and soon it won‚Äôt even be relevant as Tesla is not an automobile only company, but let‚Äôs be honest - electric, and self driving cars becoming less and less exotic. Volkswagen is quick to adapt, and pick up latest technologies to put in their cars and sell them for cheap. They provide good price value ratio, and for most people that‚Äôs what counts.  What‚Äôs driving the stock price down?,;,; 2024-01-17 10:57:33]
[Cathie Wood calls Nvidia stock 'overpriced' after missing 2023 rally,;,; Cathie Wood isn't buying the artificial intelligence hype at Nvidia (NVDA).        The founder of Ark Invest, and noted tech innovation investor, tweeted on Monday that the AI darling is now overpriced.       Nvidia shares have risen more than 30% since the company reported earnings on May 24, and the stock touched a $1 trillion dollar market cap on Tuesday.            Wood and Ark sold their holdings in Nvidia back in January. Since Nvidia's stock has more than doubled as investors have dubbed the company the clear leader in the AI chipmaking arms race. In just the past week, Nvidia announced revenue guidance that blew away Wall Street estimates and followed that news up with new AI-focused product launches.   It hasn't just been Nvidia stock soaring, either. On Friday, Marvell Technology (MRVL) said the company expects revenue attributable to AI to double the next year. Shares rose more than 30% on the news amid a broader AI-infused tech rally that's continued into Monday's trading session.   With the Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) now up more than 2.5% in the last five days, Wood argues there are going to be other winners in the AI space outside of Nvidia.   "Other companies with visionary leaders, strong global distribution and, perhaps most important, large-high-quality pools of proprietary data should be big #AI winners, with revenues and earnings surprising significantly on the high side of expectations during the years ahead," Wood tweeted.   There will be "dozens" of AI winners, according to Wood. But the one that stands out to Ark, as it often does, is Tesla (TSLA).   Wood argues that at six times revenue, Tesla stock is far cheaper than Nvidia's current 25 times revenue valuation.   "(Tesla) is the most obvious beneficiary of the recent breakthroughs in #AI, as it aims for an $8-10 trillion revenue TAM in autonomous mobility by 2030," Wood wrote.   With several positive headlines in the news of late including a growing relationship in China, Tesla shares are up more than 7% amid the broader tech rally.     Wood's Nvidia comments come as her flagship ETF, the Ark Innovation Fund (ARKK), has struggled to return to its pandemic dominance. The ETF skyrocketed during the risk-on bull market of 2020 with high-flying pandemic darlings like Tesla, Zoom (ZM), and even Nvidia contributing to gains.   But as the Federal Reserve enacted its most aggressive interest rate hike campaign in four decades, risky bets became less popular with investors. Some of Ark's top holdings, such as Zoom, Roku (ROKU), and Coinbase (COIN) are well off their pandemic highs.   The fund itself lost more than $1 billion in market cap in 2022 with shares falling nearly 67%.,;,; 2023-05-31 10:22:50]
[Why I‚Äôm Buying Rivian Stock,;,; Individual stock picking is for smart people who wear expensive suits. I‚Äôm not very smart and I hate wearing suits. I‚Äôm a boring index-fund guy. After all, history and math show us that the safe path to retirement is to simply plop money into a Vanguard fund every month. And that‚Äôs what I do with most of my money.        But sometimes I see a juicy opportunity that fires me up. Occasionally, the timing of that opportunity is juuuuusst right and I put real money on the line. This is one of those situations and I'd love to hear what you think about it.       I recently bought 4000 shares of Rivian stock (RIVN). My average cost is just over $16/share. That amounts to about $65,000. At the time of this writing, Rivian floats around $15.00/share and has a $14.5b market cap. I might buy another 1000 shares depending on the feedback that I get to this post.        Anyway, here is why I believe Rivian will 3-4x in the next few years.    # Point #1 ‚Äì Big Picture - EV‚Äôs Will Win‚Ä¶ Guaranteed.  Over the next 25 years, the auto industry is going to transition to electric vehicles because they will be cheaper to buy and operate. Hear me out:  1. Right now, batteries are the most expensive part of an EV. But EV battery tech is in its infancy. Incremental advances in batteries will increase the energy density and versatility of batteries year by year. More importantly, the industry will scale battery production by a few orders of magnitude. This will make EV batteries significantly cheaper to purchase on a per unit basis. 2. Government‚Äôs will continue to incentivize EV purchases with tax credits and other incentives for decades to come. In the long run, governments are definitely going to incentivize large scale energy creation by renewable means (which is getting cheaper and cheaper). On the other hand, western Governments are not going to subsidize or incentivize more coal power plants. That is just a fact.  3. Moreover, gas cars are only going to get more expensive operate because gas is a finite resource. The world is literally running out of oil. We‚Äôve only got like 100-200 years left. So, gas prices are going to go up guaranteed. On the other hand, we ain‚Äôt gonna run out of electricity. Humans will continue to innovate and drive down the relative cost of electricity. This is inevitable.   I know I‚Äôm painting with broad strokes here, but I think any rational mind will agree with most of these assertions. Stay with me. This post gets better as I go‚Ä¶        Now, just because EV‚Äôs will be less expensive than ICE vehicles in the long run doesn‚Äôt mean Rivian is going to win the game. OEM‚Äôs like Ford, GM &amp; Stellantis are starting to produce and sell EV‚Äôs‚Ä¶ right??? Won‚Äôt Ford and Toyota and others crush Rivian at the EV game? Nope‚Ä¶ not a chance. Keep reading and I‚Äôll show you why.   # Point #2 ‚Äì Pure EV Makers like Rivian &amp; Telsa Will Crush Traditional Auto Manufacturers  Ford, GM, and Stellantis don‚Äôt stand a chance against Tesla &amp; Rivian. Even if they start making compelling EV‚Äôs for customers, OEM‚Äôs will be at a long-term structural disadvantage to Rivian &amp; Tesla. Here is why:  1. Rivian does not have a dealership sales model. Dealerships are a useless 3rd party which customers hate. Removing the dealership permits Rivian to sell its vehicles for cheaper than it otherwise could, but also make more profit than it otherwise could. This will be a long-term structural competitive advantage over OEMs.  2. Rivian does not have unions. Unions uniquely harm the automobile industry because the cost of strikes and the cost of artificial wage increases after the strike ends increase the cost of vehicles. The 2023 UAW strike is a good example. If Rivian treats its employees with dignity and respect, they should avoid unionization. This will be a long-term competitive advantage over OEMs.  3. Rivian will make money from servicing and repairing vehicles. In the current OEM-dealership model, the dealership makes more money from the service department than it does selling vehicles. While it generally costs less to service and maintain an EV, collisions &amp; accidents can be more expensive to repair than ICE vehicles. There is a lot of money to be made by repairing &amp; servicing EVs and Rivian has it‚Äôs own service department. As such, it will capture that revenue as opposed to giving it to the dealership. This will be another long-term competitive advantage over OEMs.  4. Rivian is vertically integrated (especially when it comes to software). Traditional auto companies are not. These companies suck at software. Meanwhile, customers want high quality software in their vehicles that works seamlessly with their phones, homes, and other devices. Rivian, at its core, is a software driven company. This allows them to update their vehicles over-the-air. This will give them an enormous advantage in the long run at improving, iterating, fixing and keeping their customers happy.   Okay, okay, okay‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve convinced you that pure EV companies are going to have inherent advantages over traditional auto. That still doesn‚Äôt mean that Rivian is going to be a winner. After all‚Ä¶ Tesla is crushing them right now. Rivian isn‚Äôt even profitable yet. If you‚Äôre going to bet on a pure EV, why not pick Tesla???        Tesla is great. I‚Äôve got nothing bad to say about it. They make amazing cars, they have a genius founder, and it has amazing long-term potential. But this write-up isn‚Äôt about Tesla. I don‚Äôt think Rivian is better than Tesla. It‚Äôs not.         This write-up is more about the timing of things for Rivian. I think Rivian‚Äôs stock is uniquely undervalued right now relative to where it should be. I personally feel like this value disparity is easier for me to see for Rivian than it is for Tesla.         Anyway, lets continue‚Ä¶.   # Point #3 ‚Äì Rivian Makes Wonderful Vehicles that Customers Love  Rivian makes beautiful vehicles and customers love them. The outdoor-adventure brand is on point. Aesthetics and brand really matter to buyers, and Rivian vehicles rock.         While most people hear the name ‚ÄúRivian‚Äù they think of Rivian‚Äôs truck (R1T). But in reality their higher-priced SUV, (R1S) is far more popular. The CEO said on an earnings call that the demand is for 2 R1S‚Äôs for every 1 R1T.         Now, I see a lot of R1T‚Äôs and R1S on the road here in CA. And I see more and more of them each week. Just about every single R1S driver I see here in California is good-looking mom driving her kids to soccer. That‚Äôs a good sign. I‚Äôm convinced that middle &amp; upper-class women absolutely love the R1S. I think the R1S is going to be enormously popular. Remember how popular Range Rovers were about ten years ago? I think the R1S is going to be that kind of popular‚Ä¶.        But the R1S doesn‚Äôt just appeal to soccer moms. I want one. And I‚Äôm a guy who likes to go off-roading, camping, and hiking. I‚Äôm a dude, and I love Rivian vehicles. I think the R1S is going to be a massive hit.         Whether you believe me or not, no one can dispute that outdoor adventure brands really resonate with humans. Maybe that is why Rivian was ranked highest in customer satisfaction by JD Power in 2023. There is a lasting durability to selling adventure. I think Rivian‚Äôs brand is built to last.        Moreover, I really like Rivian‚Äôs management team. The CEO, RJ Scaringe, and CFO, Claire McDonough, just seem to work hard with their heads down. I personally like that RJ is an engineer who went to MIT. While they have clearly made a few mistakes, I don‚Äôt think they have made any big ones. They are not flashy or full of crap (think Nikola‚Ä¶).        But EVEN if I‚Äôm right about everything so far, that still doesn‚Äôt mean Rivian is a good stock to buy. Keep reading to hear the good stuff‚Ä¶.   # Point #4 ‚Äì Rivian Has Enormous Upside Right Now  Why would anyone want to invest in Rivian right now? At a surface level, Rivian looks like they have big problems:  * Currently, Rivian is losing money on every R1 vehicle it sells. It allegedly makes money on its electric delivery vans but does not disclose how much.  * Moreover, Rivian got crushed in 2022 in the supply chain shortage that delayed vehicle production. Theoretically, that could happen again.  * Then interest rates started rising in 2023 making it more expensive for normal people to get a loan to buy these pricey vehicles. Most people who buy vehicles finance or lease them. Very few people buy them with cash.  * Rivian has had growing-pains with their vehicles. They‚Äôve had recalls (steering issue), mechanical issues (tonneau cover defect), accessory issues (wireless phone charger defect), and a bunch of other minor problems. These growing pains would really frustrate me if I spent $95k on a vehicle.  * Rivian will be shutting down its production line for a few weeks in Q2 of 2024 to make improvements to the manufacturing line. This is definitely going to slow their numbers for that quarter.  * Beyond that, even if Rivian miraculously scaled production to max capacity tomorrow at their Normal, Illinois, manufacturing plant, (150,000 vehicles) and sold every vehicle at their current prices, I don‚Äôt think the company would be profitable to a level that would excite me.    Well all this sounds terrible! Why on earth would anyone buy their stock now??? Oh boy‚Ä¶ let me tell you why‚Ä¶.  &amp;#x200B;  * **Mass-Market Vehicle Announcement** \- If you‚Äôve been following Rivian, you know that it does not have a chance of long-term success unless it introduces and starts selling a mass market vehicle much like Tesla did with the Model 3 in 2017.      * The Model S really launched Tesla into the public eye in 2014/15. But it didn‚Äôt start making real money until the Model 3. The R1 line at Rivian is meant to be Rivian‚Äôs ‚ÄúModel S.‚Äù It has successfully done that. People love the product. Now, the only way Rivian will become profitable is if it starts building it‚Äôs own Model 3. And that is about to happen.     * Rivian plans to introduce the R2 on March 7, 2024, in Laguna Beach, CA. This is supposed to be an affordable midsize SUV costing anywhere between $40,000 and $50,000 per vehicle. If it is anything like the R1S, I suspect it will be beautiful and a high-quality competitor to the Model Y ‚Äì the most popular selling EV in the world.      * Rivian is currently building a manufacturing plant in Georgia to produce the R2. It has broken ground and should be finished in early 2026. Once up and fully scaled, it should be able to make 400,000 vehicles per year.   &amp;#x200B;  * **Steadily Marching to Profitability** \- As it continues to scale up production, Rivian‚Äôs loss per vehicle is shrinking dramatically quarter after quarter. In Q3 2022, it lost $139,277 per vehicle. That egregious. But that number was expected at the time and now it is shrinking dramatically. In Q3 of 2023, it lost $30,600 per vehicle. That is still a lot, but the change from one year earlier is monumental.      * Management claims they will be gross margin profitable per vehicle at the end of Q4 2024. Management says the delta they are chasing is literally baked into contracts it has with its suppliers. As they increase and improve production throughout 2024, the margin on labor per vehicle and parts from suppliers gets better and better.     * On the 2023 Q3 earnings call, the CFO said, ‚ÄúOverall, we continue to see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high-teens adjusted EBITDA margin target, and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target.‚Äù   &amp;#x200B;  * **Interest Rates Will Go Down** \- Despite a full year of rising interest rates, Rivian‚Äôs demand has been so high it has not needed to reduce prices in order to sell its very expensive vehicles. In fact, it raised prices in March 2023. Meanwhile, other EV manufacturers like Tesla have slashed prices.      * In December 2024, the federal reserve signaled it will no longer raise interest rates, and will probably start cutting them slowly over the next few years. This means demand for Rivian vehicles will only go up as their production scales up. That sounds like perfect timing.      * Moreover, when the fed starts cutting rates, trillions of dollars will start flowing back into the market, increasing valuations. Read Warren Buffet‚Äôs 1999 Fortune article called Mr. Buffett on the Stock Market. IMO, it is highly likely that ‚Äúspeculative‚Äù stocks like Rivian and Tesla will be enormous beneficiaries of all this buying. The fed may start cutting rates as early as the end of Q1 2024 (but more likely Q2 or Q3 2024).   &amp;#x200B;  * **EV‚Äôs Have Been Unfairly Beaten Up in the News Lately** ‚Äì Starting in mid/late 2023, there has been a lot of speculation in the financial news that EV‚Äôs are overhyped and will not take over the market as previously thought. This fear, uncertainty, and doubt has suppressed the share prices of all the pure EV players. If this FUD has any validity at all, it is only a short-term speed bump.    * Remember, the inherent and structural advantages of pure EV manufacturers will win out in the long run because the costs to buy EV‚Äôs will be lower than ICE vehicles (See Point #1 &amp; 2 above). Over time, this will prove decisive. Moreover, for some reason, the conservative side of the news media loves to bash EVs. This is just silly politics and will end with time. I mean, why on earth would conservatives honestly dislike American made vehicles with ridiculous amounts of horsepower! The bashing will end with time. I‚Äôm confident of that.   &amp;#x200B;  * **Rivian could announce new EDV deal at any time‚Ä¶**  Right now, Rivian has orders to sell about 85,000 more EDV‚Äôs to Amazon by 2030 under their 100,000 vehicle contract. This deal used to be ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù with Amazon, but this contract was recently changed and now Rivian can sell EDV‚Äôs to other delivery companies. That is fantastic.     * What is even better is that on November 7, 2023, RJ Scaringe said in Q3 earnings call that ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be announcing soon a range of different pilot programs that will perceive much larger orders, as these large fleets start to plan the electrification of their infrastructure.‚Äù     * A month later, in December, Rivian recently announced a pilot deal to sell an undisclosed number of EDV‚Äôs to AT&amp;T. This shot Rivian‚Äôs share price up and made investors happy. This could lead to a much larger deal in the future.     * I strongly suspect that several more pilot programs with other delivery companies will be announced in the coming months. Over time these deals will mature and large orders will be placed.   &amp;#x200B;  * **Attractive Price** \- In 2021, Rivian made its IPO during the EV stimulus-uphoria at $78/share. I did not buy a single share back then. That sounded crazy overpriced for an unproven capital-intensive car company. The share price immediately jumped near to $130/share and it has done nothing but go down ever since. It‚Äôs down over 85% to $15.50. We are close to its all-time lows. I think this presents an amazing opportunity to buy at a discount.     * Rivian‚Äôs Value Compared to Competitors ‚Äì Right now, Rivian‚Äôs market cap is $14.5 billion. This is small compared to Ford‚Äôs at $44 billion, GM‚Äôs at $47 billion, and Stellantis at $63 billion. While Rivian clearly sells less vehicles than these competitors, Rivian‚Äôs future is much brighter. I suspect a forward-looking stock market will quickly buy shares of Rivian over the next three years if it continues to make strong gains. While it will take a long time for the market to see Rivian as a premier competitor like Tesla or Toyota, I can easily see Rivian‚Äôs market cap soaring past Ford, GM, &amp; Stellantis in the next three years if it‚Äôs R2 launch is successful.    &amp;#x200B;  * **Tesla Supercharger Access**     * Range anxiety is a real thing. Until America‚Äôs EV charging infrastructure is as dependable as gas stations, it‚Äôs going to be a big factor in the buying decision. Fortunately, Tesla has paved the way and built an amazing supercharging network across the country that is extremely dependable. While Rivian is building its own network (Rivian Adventure Network), it will never be as robust as Tesla‚Äôs. Until recently, Tesla chargers were for Tesla drivers only. But not anymore‚Ä¶.     * Tesla recently announced it was going to permit competitors vehicles like Rivian to access and use its network. This is enormous news for future buyers as it will absolutely quell most of the range anxiety concerns.     * Rivian also announced it was adopting Tesla‚Äôs North American Charging Standard plug. This is the plug that Tesla uses on its vehicles. Starting in 2025, Rivian vehicles will come standard with this plug. I don‚Äôt know about you, but I think this will help hundreds of thousands of people make the decision to switch from an ICE car to an EV.    If you‚Äôve been around the market for any length of time at all, you know that the stock market is forward looking. It is constantly trying to figure out what the future holds based on all available data and placing its bet accordingly. I think most of the seven points I just made are largely unappreciated or discounted by the smart people in suits. And that is why the share price is lower than it should be. That is where our opportunity lies.        However, this investing thing is not for weaklings‚Ä¶.   # Point #5 ‚Äì Not Gonna Lie‚Ä¶ There Are Big Risks:  I‚Äôm not some delusional nerd who doesn‚Äôt understand how hard it is to make accurate predictions like this. There are some big risks here. These are the biggest ones that I see:  &amp;#x200B;  * **What if the R2 Vehicle Announcement Falls Flat?**     * When the R2 is announced on March 7th, it‚Äôs possible that the reaction will be poor. The SUV could look terrible, the specs could be unappealing, or the price could be too high.      * I think this is unlikely. Considering the care, consideration, and thought that has gone into the R1S and R1T, I expect the R2 to be a big hit and a full extension of the outdoor-adventure brand.   &amp;#x200B;  * **What if there is a Demand Problem?**      * It‚Äôs possible there is a demand problem for the R1 vehicles and the sales are not as good as I believe they are. It‚Äôs possible that inventory is rising. In early January 2024 Rivian announced it produced 17,541 and delivered 13,972 in Q4 2023. When these numbers were announced, the stock dropped 10%.      * Why the 3,569 difference? Well, between making a vehicle and selling it to a customer, it takes some time to sell, ship, and for the customer to take possession. For vehicles made in December, you can easily imagine some of those don‚Äôt actually get delivered until January.      * But why 3,569? That seems like a lot to account for that simple lag between production and delivery. According to the Q3 earnings call, the CFO said, ‚ÄúAs a reminder, because Amazon limits the intake of new commercial vans during its peak holiday delivery period, we expect a more significant gap between production and deliveries in Q4 relative to prior periods.‚Äù I find this explanation pretty satisfying.      * But if this large gap remains at the end of Q1 2024, or grows, I‚Äôm gonna start to get worried.   &amp;#x200B;  * **What if Building the Georgia Plant Runs into Problems?**     * It‚Äôs possible that there are major roadblocks to building the brand new R2 plant in Georgia. My imagination can go wild thinking about delays, permits, politics, protests, bureaucracy, accidents, and the ‚Äúproduction hell‚Äù issues that Elon Musk talks about.      * The good thing is that Rivian has gone through the production process on three different vehicles in Illinois and that experience should speed the process up. But who knows what kind of disasters could come up building a plant from scratch.   &amp;#x200B;  * **What if the March to Profitability Stalls or Reverses?**     * It‚Äôs possible that Rivian‚Äôs current march to profitability will slow to a crawl, stop, or reverse entirely. This would be bad. In the next quarter earnings statement on February 21st, Rivian better post a smaller loss than $30,600 per vehicle (Q3 2023). It better be in the mid $20k or better‚Ä¶ Absent a really good and logical explanation, I‚Äôm going to be seriously alarmed if it doesn‚Äôt get somewhere in that range.     * If this happens, that would be a strong signal that Rivian is just making too good of a car and they either need to increase the price, or make it cheaper.     * I honestly doubt this will happen. The way the CEO and CFO handle their earnings calls inspires confidence in their managerial ability. But that is my suuuuper subjective perspective.    &amp;#x200B;  * **What if they Issue More Debt and/or Dilution?**      * Rivian will probably have to raise more money to complete the plant in Georgia. But they are going to spend $5 billion to build the R2 plant in Georgia and they need to continue ramping production in Illinois. That‚Äôs a ton in capital outlay.      * Luckily, that fat IPO set Rivian up nice. Currently, Rivian has very little debt ($3bil) and a strong balance sheet (they have like $8-9 billion in cash/equivalents).     * But raising capital will either come in the form of more debt or share dilution. Either way, it won‚Äôt be great for the owners of the stock. But Wall Street already knows this, so nobody is going to freak out if it‚Äôs a small capital raise. But if its huge, yeah, I‚Äôm gonna freak out too.   &amp;#x200B;  * **What if Interest Rates Rise?**      * Inflation could spike back up like it did in the 70‚Äôs. That would prompt the fed to raise interest rates again. I think this is unlikely, but it would be a bad for every auto company if it happened.   &amp;#x200B;  * **What if Repair Cost Fears Grow?**      * The last big risk is something I don‚Äôt hear very many investment folk talk about. Repair costs.     * Repair costs seem to be very high for EV vehicles, and Rivian‚Äôs in particular. There are many stories of a medium size dent on a fender costing the customer $20-30k. This kind of stuff, if true, will drive up insurance costs. This is a red flag/danger area that will deter some cautious buyers.      * I‚Äôm not terribly worried about this. In theory, as more cars get made, repair costs will go down. But this will take time.   # Point #6 - Rivian is Not the Next Tesla (But it Doesn‚Äôt Have to Be)  I feel like everyone just wants to compare Rivian to Tesla. I think that is unwise when evaluating this investment.  Rivian only produced 57,000 vehicles in 2023. In the same timeframe, Tesla produced 1,850,000. These two companies are not even in the same universe. Tesla is at least 7-10 years ahead of Rivian. But that doesn‚Äôt matter at all for the question of whether or not you should own Rivian stock.  The great thing here is that if Tesla continues to win with the Model Y and Cybertruck, that will likely be a net benefit for Rivian. Tesla has smashed the entrenched auto-industry to bits, and Rivian is poised to take advantage of rebuilding it in the new vision of the future. The customer needs alternatives to Tesla. And Rivian is better positioned to capture market share from Subaru, Jeep, Land Rover, Toyota, Chevorlet and other brands that make adventure style trucks and SUV‚Äôs.  Tesla‚Äôs stock went from $15 a share in September of 2019 to $235 by the end of 2020. That meteoric rise was the result of a decade of work, becoming profitable, and the stimulus froth of the Covid recovery. Even if Rivian smashes its forecasts for the next two years, Rivian stock will not do what Tesla did. Tesla is so much more than a car company. As it stands, Rivian is just a car company‚Ä¶.

[Malaysia Approves Tesla's Application to Import Electric Vehicles,;,;    Malaysia's government has approved Tesla's application to import its electric vehicles into the country.  Tesla will open an office in the country, introduce its Tesla Experience Centres and Tesla Service Centres, and establish its Supercharger network, Malaysia's ministry of international trade and industry said Wednesday in a statement.  "Tesla's presence in Malaysia is expected to create skilled and better paying job opportunities for workers in the battery electric vehicles segment and increase the participation of local companies in the Tesla ecosystem both domestically and globally," it said.  The ministry said it is facilitating Tesla's entry to the country through a new initiative to boost demand for battery-powered electric vehicles and develop an entire ecosystem in the country.  The initiative aims to attract investments from top international electric-vehicle manufacturing companies to Malaysia and Tesla was the first applicant of this initiative, the ministry added.

[What would need to happen for TSLA to *not* be overvalued today?,;,; Currently TSLA is trading close to $265/share, or about an $880B market cap.  It's a reasonable argument that if an asset can beat the S&amp;P 500 CAGR, then it's a good investment. Given that the S&amp;P typically provides a 5% CAGR, let's see what would be needed for Tesla to achieve a 10% CAGR by, let's say.. end of 2030.  $880B \* 1.10\^7 = $1.71T market cap, or about $512/share  So how does Tesla make it to a $1.7T market cap in 2030? I'm going to assume a 30 P/E, which everyone will bitch and complain about beause they hate Tesla, but I think there's reasonable arguments for and against 30. The "for" argument being that I believe they'll still be growing EV sales and energy storage products. If a 30 P/E, then Tesla needs:  $1710B / 30 = $57B in gaap earnings  So how much gaap earnings does Tesla make per EV sold? I'll link to a graph of the "TTM avg gaap earnings per EV sold" in the comments  Tesla's current earnings profitability is about $5,600 per EV sold, and it continues to go up over the long term, even if rates have caused a recent drop (earnings per EV maxed out at $10.3k in q1 2022). Let's just assume a long term profitability of $5,700 per EV (super conservative imo). Tesla will need to sell about  $57B earnings / $5,700 earnings per EV = 10M EVs annually  Conclusion: If Tesla sells 10M EVs in 2030, then it is not overvalued today, in fact.. it beats the S&amp;P. This isn't even including profits from the energy storage sector of the business, or the wildcards of robotaxis and bots.,;,; 2023-09-19 19:11:24]

[Tesla's earnings should improve in Q4; short TSLA puts now for income.,;,; In Q3, Tesla reported modest results with a 5% YoY increase in automotive revenue and a 9% YoY increase in total revenue, attributed to price decreases, lower sales volume, and production. Despite this, the company generated positive free cash flow (FCF) of $0.8 billion, with a 3.4% FCF margin.        Analysts are more optimistic about Q4, forecasting a 10.6% potential gain in adjusted non-GAAP EPS to 73 cents and a 9.5% increase in total revenue to $25.7 billion. However, Tesla's stock (TSLA) has seen a decline, down 8.1% in the last month and 20.1% from its peak in July, possibly reflecting pessimism.        Option premiums are high due to this pessimism, providing an opportunity for investors to sell short near-term out-of-the-money (OTM) puts as an income play. For instance, by selling the $220 strike price expiring on Dec. 8 for $4.35, investors can achieve an immediate 1.98% yield for three weeks.        Investors must secure $22,000 in cash or margin to sell 1 put contract, potentially making $7,395 annually if the trade is repeated every three weeks. However, this strategy carries risks, as TSLA could drop below the breakeven level, requiring the investor to purchase 100 shares at the strike price.        To manage downside risk, investors can buy puts at a lower OTM strike price, such as the $210 puts, reducing potential losses. Alternatively, a very conservative approach involves shorting the $210 puts for immediate income and a lower breakeven level.        Investors should carefully monitor market conditions and adjust their strategy accordingly, potentially selling $210 puts for income once it appears unlikely that TSLA will fall near that price within the next three weeks.    ,;,; 2023-11-20 10:53:46]
[Why Tesla ($TSLA) stock has tanked over the past 5 days,;,;    Tesla stock ($TSLA) has gone downhill in the wake of a shaky earnings release last week.  The EV player has seen its stock tank about 18% to $154 since its first-quarter earnings release on April 19.  The share price slide has wiped out about $87 billion in market capitalization for Tesla. Tesla's market has dipped below the $500 billion mark, currently resting at $487 billion.Year to date, Tesla's stock is still up 24%, compared to a 5.6% advance for the S&amp;P 500.Investors are probably locking in on several issues that have swirled around Tesla in recent days.  The initial is a bad first-quarter gross profit margin miss. Wall Street pinned the blame on Tesla's steady drumbeat of price cuts in the quarter.  "Let's call it like it is: Tesla delivered mixed results with solid demand metrics, but the elephant in the room is softer margins," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients.  CEO Elon Musk did little to stem margin concerns on the earnings call. Musk and his CFO, Zach Kirkhorn, leaned into a philosophy of wanting to move more EVs, even if that means cutting prices further and pressuring margins.  Wall Street was having none of it, coming out with cautious takes and downwardly revised profit estimates.  "Although both technology and execution risk seem substantially less than was once feared, expansion into higher volume segments with lower price points seems fraught with greater risk relative to demand, execution, and competition," JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a client note.  Brinkman reiterated an Underweight rating on Tesla's stock (sell equivalent).  The Detroit-based auto giant touted market share gains in EVs. It also detailed plans to double EV production in the second half of this year as it eyes taking away more of Tesla's dominance.,;,; 2023-04-28 08:55:13]

[American Companies Plan on Becoming Employers‚Äô Landlords by Building Company Towns,;,; https://decodetoday.com/american-companies-building-company-towns/  Article body:  The housing crisis in the United States has prompted some major companies to consider building company towns. Instead of relying on traditional rental properties, companies such as Google, Tesla, and Meta are exploring the idea of becoming landlords themselves, building company towns, and purchasing large pieces of land to provide housing for their workers.  In the early 20th century, company towns were a common sight, designed to provide housing, schools, stores, and a sense of community for workers. Fast forward to the present day, and Silicon Valley giants are revisiting this concept, exploring the creation of self-contained communities for their workforce. While the concept of company towns is not new, this modern approach involves providing a range of amenities and services within the community, such as parks, restaurants, and shops, to create a sense of community and improve the work-life balance of employees.  Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is planning to build an entire town near Austin, Texas, where three of his companies, Boring, Tesla, and SpaceX, have operations. The new company town is intended to offer below-market rents to his employees, providing an attractive solution to the housing challenges faced by many workers. Similarly, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, is also considering the construction of a company town to provide housing for its employees. Google is already in the process of building a 153-acre neighborhood near its headquarters in Mountain View, California, which will include over 7,000 residential units and 26 acres of public parks and open space.  While the idea of corporate-built company towns addresses the pressing issue of housing shortages, it has also sparked concerns about employee flexibility. With health insurance already tied to employment, intertwining housing with work could further limit an individual‚Äôs freedom to change jobs or locations. Critics argue that this deliberate entanglement is an attempt by companies to exert greater control over their workforce.  In response to these developments, legislation has been introduced to address the growing need for affordable housing. The proposed Workforce Housing Tax Credit Act seeks to provide states and developers with a new source of funding for the production of affordable rental housing. The Workforce Housing Tax Credit (WHTC) Act aims to incentivize the creation of housing for middle-income families. However, skeptics question the true intentions behind the legislation, speculating that it may serve as a tool for companies to claim tax credits while gaining additional influence over their employees.  The trend of companies building towns for their employees is not confined to the United States. Globally, mega-projects like NEOM are emerging as examples where entire towns are being constructed to accommodate workers. This global phenomenon highlights the evolving nature of the employer-employee relationship and the growing influence of corporations in shaping the living environments of their workforce.,;,; 2024-01-16 12:19:54]
[Which company are you willing to buy its shares but never their products/services?,;,; I am curious if you all have such cases. I've learned over the years that it's easier to invest in companies whose products/services I use but it's not really the best strategy as personal biases apply (ex: I use ASOS a lot for my clothes but their share has been getting hammered since the post-pandemic peak).  So, I've decided to actually search for solid companies to buy, even if I don't buy their products. Two quick examples of mine:  1. AAPL: Probably the most well-run company in recent years. I never owned a single Apple product, as I've always considered them overpriced and my stubborn-ass being fixated on android phones and microsoft products. But I cannot dispute how well the company is ran and able to secure a loyal customer line and solid profit margins year after year.  2. TSLA: Personally, I don't ever plan on buying a Tesla car and I also don't really like Elon as a person. But I still have to acknowledge some of the advantages that Tesla has as a company, especially their data collecting systems. I think Tesla has a great future and even if I'm not a fan of Elon, I can still put my biases aside and realize that there's ton of experienced investors who trust him. He has a great track record of building companies so that's a risk I'm willing to take (TSLA is like 3-4% of my portfolio)  Do you have any similar examples?,;,; 2023-05-29 14:12:18]

[Unusual options activity in Tesla stock shows a large investor taking a position,;,; Two large tranches of Tesla (TSLA) stock options were traded on May 30: one a near-term in-the-money put position and the other a long-term way out-of-the-money call option. This unusual stock options activity is likely from a large investor.  The Unusual Stock Options Activity on May 30 showed that there were 13,039 put options traded at the $202.50 strike price for expiration on June 2, this Friday. The second tranche was for 13,064 call options traded at the $310 strike price for expiration on Oct. 20, 2023, 142 days from now.  **Large Calls And Puts In TSLA Stock**  The first tranche of options (puts) was in-the-money since the price of TSLA stock closed at $201.16 on Tuesday, May 16. The second tranche was way out-of-the-money (OTM) since the $310 call strike price is 54% higher than today's price.   But interestingly, both had very similar prices. That's what makes me believe that both tranches were likely initiated together. For example, the puts closed at $5.45 per put contract, and the calls traded at $5.15 per call contract.  That implies that the investor may have gone long the puts and paid the $5.45 price, even though they only have $1.34 of intrinsic value (i.e., $202.50-201.16=$1.34). The reason is that they shorted the OTM calls and received $5.15 per call contract. That leaves a net cost of just 30 cents (i.e., $5.45-$5.15).         So, in effect, the short-put investor has a profit of $1.04 in the long puts, as long as TSLA stock stays at $201.16 or lower. Meanwhile, they must figure the call options will wither over time unless TSLA stock rises by over 54% over the next 142 days (almost 4.75 months from now).  **Where TSLA Stock Stands Now**  Tesla stock is up over 22% so far in May and has risen 63.3% so far in 2023 since it closed at $123.18 at the end of 2022. Moreover, the company reported on April 19 that Q1 revenue rose 24% YoY compared to last year, although non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) fell 22%.         However, analysts expect EPS to rise to $3.50 per share this year and $5.03 next year, up 43.7% by the end of 2024. This puts TSLA stock on a forward multiple of 40x for 2024, which is not that expensive.         So, theoretically, TSLA stock could rise 54% by Oct 20, especially since by then analysts would have received the Q3 earnings report for the quarter ending Sept. 30. Nevertheless, that could be a reach. In other words, it's possible that the call options could potentially be worth $5.15 by Oct. 20.        Nevertheless, there is a good possibility that TSLA might not be seen as undervalued given how far it has risen this year. That is likely what the investor who likely shorted these deep OTM calls is counting on.        It also shows that the investor is likely more bearish on TSLA stock as they have, in effect, a large in-the-money put position that is mostly paid for by shorting the OTM calls. So investors who intend to copy these moves should be careful.    **Another Interpretation**  Also, keep in mind that my interpretation of these tranches may not be correct. It is possible the investor went long on these OTM $310 strike price calls. They may have shorted the in-the-money puts with the hope that TSLA stock will rise in the next 2 days. That is they shorted the $202.50 puts, received $5.45 per contract, and turned around and used those proceeds to purchase the $310 strike price calls, paying $5.15 per contract for them.        At least that way the long call position is more than paid for, with a net 30-cent credit (i.e., $5.45 from the short puts - $5.15 for the long OTM calls). And even if the $202.50 strike price puts are exercised, at least then the investor will own the TSLA shares at $202.50 (less 30 cents net credit). So then they will have a covered call position with the $310 OTM calls.        Either way, you can see that a large investor has taken a big position in TSLA stock which is mostly bullish. You can decide if you want to copy them.,;,; 2023-06-01 10:32:55]

Meanwhile, days after Tesla increased U.S. Model Y all-wheel drive prices by $250, the company now offers discounts of around $500 on some inventory vehicles.        Tesla also appears to be trying to move Model 3 inventory. Last week, the automaker began offering customers who order a Model 3 between June 14 and June 30 three months of unlimited free supercharging, according to the company's website.        In China, Tesla is offering insurance subsidies on Model 3 vehicles. From June 16 to June 30, customers in China who buy and complete delivery of an in-inventory Model 3 rear-wheel drive vehicle will be eligible for an insurance subsidy of about $1,120.        In China last week, Tesla sold 14,500 vehicles, down 12% from the 16,400 vehicles sold in the previous week.

[Is Tesla the Ultimate Investment? Garry Breaks Down the Numbers, Growth, and Unveils the EV Game-Changer!,;,; According to Garry, Investment advisor,Tesla ($TSLA) currently sits at $250 per share, trading at 58 times his estimated 2024 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $4.30. Garry's take on this? He believes it's a reasonable valuation, especially when considering the projected +28% increase in volume and an impressive +32% growth in EPS between now and 2030. This positions Tesla's Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio at 1.8x, notably lower than Apple's ($AAPL) 3.0x PEG.  Garry's outlook extends to global EV adoption, forecasting a rise from the current 13% to a substantial 60% by 2030, sporting a +24% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CGR). With faith in the Cybertruck and Tesla's $25,000 next-gen vehicle, Garry expects Tesla to boost its global EV market share from 16% to 20% by 2030. The outcome? Tesla's vehicle volumes surging from 1.8 million in 2023 to 2.4 million in 2024 and an impressive 10.2 million by 2030 (+28% CGR).  Factoring in aspects like auto gross margin expansion, contributions from energy, operating leverage, and cash reinvestment, Garry foresees Tesla's Adjusted EPS climbing from $3.20 in 2023 to $22 in 2030 (+32% CGR). Interestingly, Garry's projections don't include potential revenues from Full Self-Driving (FSD) licensing, robotaxi ventures, or other futuristic elements. However, they do consider FSD at a 15% global take rate and energy revenues rising by a factor of eight.  The central question, as per Garry's analysis, is whether a P/E ratio of 58x is too steep for the premier EV player, set to experience a +28% CGR in volume and +32% CGR in EPS. Garry challenges you to find another mega-cap stock with this level of growth and valuation, particularly with traditional automakers pulling back from their EV commitments. In his view, Tesla stands out as the primary investment opportunity in the evolving EV landscape.,;,; 2023-12-19 10:39:22]

PPI is a leading indicator of CPI. YOY flat for first time since feb 2021, no increase. That‚Äôs probably not great for BOJ who want to see persistently higher inflation.    * **UK EMPLOYMENt NUMBERS:**   Employment change came stronger than expected at 73k vs 50k forecast.

[TSLA for Long Term,;,; Hey fellow Redditors!   I‚Äôm curious to hear your thoughts on Tesla and whether you‚Äôre feeling bullish about its long-term potential.   With the electric vehicle market expanding and Tesla‚Äôs continuous innovations in renewable energy, some investors see promising signs.  However, concerns about competition and market dynamics also exist.   What‚Äôs your take on TSLA‚Äôs future?,;,; 2024-01-25 21:07:15]
[Tesla stock ($TSLA) sinks as Barclays says it's time 'to move to the sidelines'.,;,; Tesla ($TSLA) stock sank 5.5% on Wednesday, its steepest loss in two months, after one analyst on Wall Street cautioned it was time to take some money off the table.        In a note to investors on Wednesday, Barclays analyst Dan Levy downgraded Tesla shares to Equal Weight from Overweight, claiming the recent rally ignored near-term questions about the stock‚Äôs fundamentals. Though Tesla doesn‚Äôt exactly trade on fundamentals ‚Äî it currently trades at a forward P/E of 80 ‚Äî Levy does make some interesting points about where Tesla stock sits compared to only a month ago.        ‚ÄúWe believe the stock‚Äôs recent rally can be best explained by the market‚Äôs current AI-driven thematic trade, as well as excitement over recent announcements to open the TSLA Supercharger network to other brands,‚Äù Levy said in his note. ‚ÄúYet while we aren‚Äôt surprised that the stock has participated in the rally, we believe it is prudent to move to the sidelines.‚Äù  Levy‚Äôs main thesis for the downgrade rests on three main points: the AI effect that may be overblown, Tesla‚Äôs recent Supercharger deals and uncertain benefits, and, most importantly, how multiple expansion is really the ‚Äúentirety of the rally.‚Äù        As for AI, the recent run-up in Nvidia and other AI-related stocks that looped in Tesla made sense because of the company‚Äôs ventures like FSD (full self-driving), its Dojo supercomputer, and the Optimus robot (though somewhat ironically CEO Elon Musk has warned about the dangers of AI). Levy however believes AI is a ‚Äúlong-dated‚Äù opportunity for Tesla, not something that can be counted on right now to considerably boost its valuation.  Similarly, Tesla‚Äôs charging deals with Ford, GM, and Rivian are seen more as creating ‚Äúmarketing benefits‚Äù for Tesla, with any gains again probably coming in the long term, Levy says.        The biggest factor for the \~$300 billion run-up in Tesla stock has been its expanding multiple, Levy said. Tesla‚Äôs near-term fundamentals haven‚Äôt changed, and while other AI-related stocks have seen positive profit revisions that led to market cap increases, this isn‚Äôt the case for Tesla.        Levy believes a number of factors fly in the face of that ballooning multiple, including that Barclays believes Tesla‚Äôs 2024 consensus EPS estimates are still too rosy and need to be brought down. In addition, Tesla‚Äôs margins are still ‚Äúuncertain‚Äù given recent price cuts, though it is possible margins may have troughed. Finally, more price cuts may be necessary as Model 3 inventories look bloated, and increased Model Y production in Giga Austin and Berlin may necessitate further price reductions, again hurting margins.        All that being said, Levy is still long-term bullish on Tesla‚Äôs prospects, just not a buyer at these levels. ‚ÄúWe continue to see TSLA as the long-term winner amongst OEMs in the race to an EV world,‚Äù Levy says, but ‚Äúnear term fundamentals need to be considered.‚Äù,;,; 2023-06-22 06:21:56]
[Tesla's valuation could soar by another $150 billion thanks to the rise of the robo-taxi, RBC says,;,; * Tesla shares could jump another 19% thanks to the rise of robot-taxis, according to RBC. * That would add over $150 billion to the EV giant's total market capitalization. * Robo-taxis "could potentially transform society" and account for over 70% of Tesla's future value, analysts said.  Tesla's market capitalization could soar by over $150 billion thanks to a looming surge in demand for robo-taxis, according to RBC Capital Markets.  The self-driving taxi "could potentially transform society more than anything else in our lifetimes" and makeup over 70% of the EV giant's future value, a team of analysts led by Tom Narayan said in a note to clients Thursday.  The Canadian bank lifted its price target for Tesla's stock to $305 ‚Äì over 19% above the $255.90 shares traded at as of Thursday's close.  Those gains would add another $155 billion to Elon Musk's company's total valuation, by Insider's calculations. Tesla has already seen its market cap surge by over $270 billion in the past month after it struck deals with General Motors and Ford that would allow them access to the EV leader's charging infrastructure.  Tesla should be able to dominate the robot-taxi market given how well-developed its self-driving tech already is, according to RBC.  Narayan's team estimated that Musk's EV maker could achieve a 25% market share in the US, as well as an 8% share in Europe and a 7% share in China.  Tesla's share price is already up 107% in 2023, with the EV maker adding over $300 billion of market cap over the past month alone.  The robo-taxi is the strongest of several factors that will help the stock extend its breakneck rally, according to RBC.  Tesla's early success in its price war and the landmark deals it signed with Ford and General Motors last month could also fuel further gains, the analysts said.  They added that the stock will also benefit from the frenzy for artificial intelligence, which has helped fellow tech giant Nvidia to rack up triple-digit gains and reach a $1 trillion valuation.,;,; 2023-06-17 09:25:19]

The update, described in the coding as a ‚ÄúDrive on Sunshine,‚Äù explains that you can ‚Äúset your vehicle‚Äôs battery to charge as usual from any available sources for enough daily driving range. Then reserve part of your vehicle‚Äôs battery to charge only when excess solar is available.‚Äù  This is a big deal because it moves Tesla closer to the company‚Äôs ultimate goal of having its cars run on 100% clean, renewable energy. Energy sources don‚Äôt get much cleaner than solar, so allowing Tesla owners use of all the energy they generate from their home solar arrays is a huge step.,;,; 2023-04-26 13:01:36]

[Cathie Wood's ARK Invest sold most of its Nvidia stake just before the chipmaker kicked off a rally that added $585 billion in market value,;,; Cathie Wood's Ark Invest is probably wishing it didn't sell nearly 1 million shares of Nvidia between early October and today following the chipmaker's massive year-to-date surge of more than 160%.  Nvidia stock soared as much as 30% on Thursday after the company announced jaw-dropping guidance as it benefits from a wave of demand for its chipsets that support generative AI technology platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Bard.  But the active investment manager, who has owned Nvidia on and off since the flagship fund's inception in 2014, missed out on massive gains as it started to pare down its position in Nvidia heading into a 52-week low in mid-October.  Since Ark Invest's first sale on October 5, when it held 1.3 million shares of Nvidia across all of its ETFs, the stock has soared 190% and added $620 billion to its market value. By late November, Nvidia owned just over 500,000 shares of the company.  Today, Ark Invest holds just 390,000 shares across its suite of next-generation technology ETFs. The stock is not in its flagship Disruptive Innovation fund.  Rough calculations by Insider suggest Ark Invest left more than $200 million in potential profits on the table when it sold down its Nvidia stake throughout the end of last year.   Ark's ill-timed share sale of Nvidia highlights the difficulties of actively managing a portfolio of disruption-focused investments, because even if you pick the right theme to invest in, there's no guarantee you'll pick the right companies to bet on.  **In February, Wood said Ark's wave of Nvidia sales was in part because its valuation was "very high" and that it was consolidating its portfolio into higher conviction names.**  "We like Nvidia, we think it's going to be a good stock. It's priced, it's the 'check-the-box' AI company. For a flagship fund, where we're consolidated towards our highest conviction names, part of that has to do with the valuation," she told CNBC on February 27.  Wood is instead counting on UiPath for Ark Invest's exposure to artificial intelligence, which is its second largest position across all of its ETFs. Meanwhile, Tesla remains Ark Invest's top holding, which is also working on artificial intelligence to help enable its self-driving technology.   But despite the hype in AI this year, those two stocks have only captured some of the year-to-date gains seen across the space. Shares of UIPath are up just 14% year-to-date, while Tesla stock is up an impressive 50%.   Shares of Ark Invest's Disruptive Innovation ETF were down 2.7% on Thursday, despite the Nasdaq 100 jumping 1.7%.   https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/cathie-wood-ark-invest-sold-nvidia-stake-before-ai-rally-2023-5?,;,; 2023-05-25 23:55:45]

This is a huge boost for Mexico, as it's trying to establish itself as a hub for investment by bringing manufacturing capacity to North America and away from Asia, thanks to geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Lopez Obrador revealed that he had a call with Elon Musk on Monday, and they came to an agreement that will create lots of jobs and bring in a considerable investment. The President had previously expressed concerns over water shortages, but Musk was receptive and has accepted Mexico's proposals.  This investment is a big test for Mexico's President, who has a reputation for being a bit of a resource nationalist. Some companies have been unsettled by his efforts to strengthen state control of the energy market at the expense of private capital. But with Mexico receiving its highest foreign direct investment inflows for years in 2022, it's clear that the country's lower-cost and skilled workforce is making it a global center for the car industry.  We don't know all the details just yet, but Lopez Obrador said Tesla will likely give us more information tomorrow. It's all happening during Musk's "Investor Day," where he'll outline his "Master Plan Part Three."  (source: [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mexican-president-says-tesla-build-143052963.html))  Not sure whether to buy calls or puts on Musk? Here's a strategy so you don't have to be married to one direction. With this ratio spread you can make up to 14% (20% annualized) AND still be protected if TSLA dips.

[Interesting Bloomberg article this morning: ChatGPT can decode Fed speak and predict stock moves from headlines,;,; I came across [this article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-17/chatgpt-can-decode-fed-speak-predict-stock-moves-from-headlines#xj4y7vzkg?leadSource=uverify%20wall?leadSource=uverify%20wall?leadSource=uverify%20wall) on Bloomberg that talks about how ChatGPT can analyze financial news and statements and generate insights and predictions for investors such as:  * Interpret the tone and sentiment of Fed officials and central bankers and gauge their policy stance * Extract key information from earnings reports and company announcements and assess their impact on stock prices * Generate natural language summaries of complex financial data and trends * Answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises  The article also mentions some examples of how ChatGPT performed on some recent headlines and statements, such as:  * ‚ÄúFed Chair Powell says economy is at an ‚Äòinflection point‚Äô with stronger growth ahead‚Äù * ‚ÄúTesla reports record deliveries of 184,800 vehicles in Q1 2023‚Äù * ‚ÄúGameStop announces $1 billion stock sale plan‚Äù  ChatGPT gave some interesting responses, such as:  * ‚ÄúPowell‚Äôs statement suggests that he is optimistic about the economic recovery and expects inflation to remain under control. This could imply that the Fed will maintain its accommodative monetary policy for longer, which could support the stock market.‚Äù * ‚ÄúTesla‚Äôs delivery numbers exceeded analysts‚Äô expectations and showed strong demand for its electric vehicles. This could boost its revenue and profitability in the quarter and improve its competitive position in the industry. Tesla‚Äôs stock price could rise on this positive news.‚Äù * ‚ÄúGameStop‚Äôs stock sale plan indicates that it is trying to take advantage of its elevated share price and raise capital to fund its turnaround strategy. However, this could also dilute existing shareholders and put downward pressure on the stock price. GameStop‚Äôs stock price could drop on this announcement.‚Äù  I think this is a fascinating application of AI and NLP to the financial domain, and I wonder how accurate and reliable ChatGPT can be in its predictions.

[Elon Musk Echoing Jim Farley That UAW Demands Will Bankrupt the Big Three with Their Demands,;,; Scaling the production of EVs and selling them is hard for the the big three. Currently, increasing the cost of labor will make it even harder. With the current economic environment, it doesn't seem to make sense to get pay raises now when the automakers are trying to transition to EV production. Seeing how EVs are trending, it's like a double whammy trying to sell an unprofitable EV that takes away the sale of a profitable ICE vehicle.

You have to move heaven and earth to make any changes because how the software they use was an amalgamation from different companies, whereas Tesla was developed inhouse.

[Help me with the math on TSLA supercharging,;,; Lots of hype lately about the NACS plug standard adoption. Yes, it‚Äôs a good thing to have one type of plug across most/all cars.  Yes, it will potentially generate more revenue for Tesla by increasing demand at super charger stations.  However, I am seeing incredibly high $billion dollar revenue numbers getting thrown around like candy.  Knowing the realization of this NACS adoption is years away and that Tesla has something like 17000 stations in the USA, let‚Äôs do some math:  Assuming each charger is active everyday for 1 year and they are fully utilized at 24 times per day. At their charge rate I was told by others that each charge generates about $25 per.  I think I am being very optimistic and conservative.    So, I get to about $3.7/3.8B per year in Revenue (not earnings).   If Tesla in 5 years doubled that 17000 in US then of course double that revenue number.    Again, lots of assumptions and fairly optimistic and conservative.    Where do all these so called expert analysts get their wild revenue numbers?   I have seen $10B plus in revenue by 2030 and $100B plus by xxxx.  Are they assuming that the rest of the world will also use Tesla super chargers at this same rate?   Tesla will have no competition for charging?   That EVs will dominate the car industry in next 5-10 years?   Etc.  OK, let‚Äôs throw in all 40000 chargers world wide and using same estimates we are $8.8B per year.  Again, huge assumptions into the far off future.    Aren‚Äôt the Tesla market cap increases after all these announcements ridiculous?  Are analysts intentionally misleading investors with their unrealistic expectations for the next 5-10 years?  Are investors blinded by the momentum trade?   Is this another meme moment?    What am I missing?,;,; 2023-06-21 10:56:13]

[Dow Jones futures rise; a sale at Silicon Valley Bank closes; Microsoft, Tesla near buy points,;,; Dow Jones futures rose slightly Sunday night, along with S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The bank crisis is still in focus. Headlines have been relatively modest so far this weekend, though a deal may be close for FDIC-controlled Silicon Valley Bank.  A stock market rally attempt is ongoing, but the indexes have been volatile while breadth has been narrow.  The major indexes rose modestly for the week, but came far off weekly highs. The Russell 2000 hit 2023 lows with bank stocks, but small caps and banks edged up for the week.  The rally attempt has relied heavily on big-cap Nasdaq stocks. Apple stock, ¬†Microsoft ($MSFT), Tesla ($TSLA), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals ($REGN), MercadoLibre ($MELI) and Palo Alto Networks ($PANW) are Nasdaq 100 stocks that are holding up well.  REGN stock gapped up into a buy zone late in the week on positive drug trial news. Apple ($AAPL) and Microsoft are just above buy points while Palo Alto is just below an entry. MercadoLibre and Tesla stock are holding key support levels, not far from being actionable. All boast strong relative strength lines. MercadoLibre and PANW stock are on IBD Leaderboard. AAPL stock is on SwingTrader. MSFT stock is on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list. MELI stock is on the IBD 50.   Just because individual stocks are possible buys doesn't mean investors have to act on them. This market rally attempt still needs to confirm its uptrend.   ## Bank News  This weekend has been relatively quiet for banking news, at least in comparison to the prior two weekends. The news generally has been about resolution vs. frantic efforts to avoid systemic collapse.  First Citizens BancShares is in advanced talks to buy SVB Financial's Silicon Valley Bank, Bloomberg reported Sunday evening.  The FDIC has been looking to unload Silicon Valley Bank since taking over more than two weeks ago. Reports last week suggested that the regulator might shoulder some of the underwater assets to smooth the way for a deal.  U.S. regulators could expand an emergency lending facility for banks, with an aim at helping First Republic bolster its balance sheet, Bloomberg reported Saturday, citing sources. Authorities are mulling various options. They don't see any First Republic as needing urgent new help as the California-based bank tries to work out solutions with its advisers.  Late Friday, the Fed reported that deposits at small domestically chartered banks fell by $120 billion in the week March 15, but rose $67 billion at large domestically chartered banks.  On Friday, many banks rebounded from 2023 lows after concerns expanded, at least briefly, to Deutsche Bank. Even Wall Street giants such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley undercut recent lows before closing better.

[WSJ - S&amp;P 500 ends longest bear market since the 1940s and signals beginning of new bull market.,;,; U.S. stocks rose Thursday, ending the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs longest bear market since the 1940s and marking the start of a new bull run.   The broad index powered higher over the past few months, in large part because of a handful of companies posting outsize gains.  Many of those same stocks, including Amazon.com, Tesla and chip maker Nvidia, led the market‚Äôs advance Thursday.   That helped propel the S&amp;P 500 up 0.6%, allowing the index to finish up 20% from its October low.  The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to 33833.  Treasury yields retreated. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 3.714%, down from 3.782% Wednesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.  Analysts attributed the relative calm to traders taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of key events next week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release fresh data on inflation Tuesday, while the Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest-rate decision Wednesday.  So far, positioning in futures markets suggests many traders are betting the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged in June. That might offer markets some relief in the short-term, although investors warn that there could still be more policy-tightening ahead.   ‚ÄúA pause does not mean they are done with rate hikes,‚Äù said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors.   Traders are betting volatility could pick up in the coming months. The options contracts with the biggest positions tied to the Cboe Volatility Index, or Wall Street‚Äôs ‚Äúfear gauge,‚Äù are wagers that it will surge to 30‚Äîa level associated with investor anxiety‚Äîor 60, a level only seen during stock-market crashes.

That marked the company‚Äôs longest winning streak since an 11-session run that ended in January 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data.   Carvana, the online used car retailer, rose 56% to $24.23 after saying it expects its profit to jump in the second quarter.  GameStop plunged 18% to $21.44 after the videogame retailer fired its CEO, Matt Furlong, and appointed board member Ryan Cohen as its new executive chairman.   U.S. crude oil prices initially dropped after a report suggested U.S.-Iran talks on a temporary nuclear deal could allow the Islamic Republic to export more crude.

This week Tesla jumped to $170, and that alone netted him $7k profit.  This seems like free money or easy money. Of course Tesla is bound to have a few pumps.

[Morgan Stanley Sees Dojo Boosting TSLA Value by $500 Billion,;,; Headline comes from Bloomberg [(yahoo link)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-surge-thanks-dojo-supercomputer-032644640.html)  TSLA is up nearly 10% today.  Morgan Stanley's upgrade of TSLA was a target of $400, up from $250.  Excerpt from the article:  &gt; Tesla has been mentioning how Dojo gives it an edge in AI and self-driving technology since at least 2021. In July this year, CEO Elon Musk told investors that the carmaker plans to invest more than $1 billion on the project by the end of 2024.  &gt; ‚ÄúAs a point of reference, in 2022, Nvidia spent $7 billion across the entire company on research and development,‚Äù Gene Munster, co-founder and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, wrote in a note in July. ‚ÄúIn other words, spending $1 billion plus on a single product is aggressive and speaks to Musk‚Äôs urgency at making good on this FSD prediction.‚Äù  &gt; Seth Goldstein of Morningstar Research Services LLC says that, ‚Äúwhile it‚Äôs good for Elon to push the team to go as quickly as possible, in reality Tesla usually sees a delay from Elon‚Äôs original timelines.‚Äù  &gt; ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt making progress,‚Äù Goldstein said in a phone interview Monday. ‚ÄúOnce Dojo is up and running and takes over the software training, it will allow Tesla to update software more quickly and increase subscriptions at software margins, which can be a big value driver.‚Äù,;,; 2023-09-11 18:14:43]

[Rivian Down 9% as EV Maker Announces $1.5B Convertible Bond Sale,;,; [https://tokenist.com/rivian-down-9-as-ev-maker-announces-1-5b-convertible-bond-sale/](https://tokenist.com/rivian-down-9-as-ev-maker-announces-1-5b-convertible-bond-sale/)  Rivian, an electric vehicle startup, witnessed a 9% drop in its share value during premarket trading on Thursday, following its announcement to sell convertible green bonds worth $1.5 billion. This nearly negated the 9.2% surge the company experienced on Wednesday, propelled by a robust quarterly vehicle delivery report. The bond sale decision was not well-received by investors since convertible bonds can dilute share value upon conversion. These bonds are scheduled to mature in October 2030, offering investors an option to convert them into either cash or company shares. In contrast to the bond sale setback, Rivian has showcased impressive performance in recent months. Its Q2 and Q3 2023 vehicle delivery numbers exceeded Wall Street predictions, with the company affirming its aim to produce 52,000 vehicles by the end of 2023.

[Short sellers go after renewable and EV stocks,;,;     Short sellers are taking positions against electric vehicle and solar stocks, which have experienced a decline in their value recently. A report from Hazeltree, a treasury and liquidity management platform, indicates that luxury electric vehicle startups like Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID), as well as EV giant Tesla (TSLA), were among the top 10 most shorted stocks in the large and mid-cap sectors in October.        The report also assigns a "crowdedness" score, representing the securities that a high percentage of funds are shorting. Interestingly, ExxonMobil (XOM), an oil giant, emerged as the most crowded large-cap stock in October, replacing Tesla after four consecutive months as the top shorted security.        In the small-cap sector, renewable energy companies Sunrun (RUN) and Sunnova Energy (NOVA) were among the top 10 most crowded securities, with a high percentage of funds shorting these stocks.        The decline in the value of solar, wind, and electric vehicle stocks is attributed to industry headwinds and a higher interest rate environment. Short selling involves borrowing a stock and selling it on the open market with the intention of buying it back later at a lower price when the security is repurchased, which is known as covering the short or closing out the position.        Notable declines in these stocks include Rivian's 35% drop since mid-July, Lucid's 49% decline over the same period, and Sunrun and Sunnova's drops of more than 50% since mid-July.            ,;,; 2023-11-10 11:11:49]

[It‚Äôs official: Student loan payments will restart in October, Education Department says,;,; [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/20/its-official-student-loan-payments-will-restart-in-october.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/20/its-official-student-loan-payments-will-restart-in-october.html)  Over the three-year-long pause on student loan payments, the U.S. Department of Education has repeatedly told borrowers their bills were set to resume, only to take it back and provide them more time.This time, however, the agency really means it.The Education Department posted on its website that ‚Äúpayments will be due starting in October,‚Äù and a recent law passed by Congress will make changing that plan difficult. It will likely be a big adjustment for borrowers when the pandemic-era policy expires. Around 40 million Americans have debt from their education. The typical monthly bill is roughly $350.‚ÄúFor many borrowers, the payment pause has been life altering ‚Äî saving many from financial ruin and allowing others to finally get ahead financially,‚Äù said Persis Yu, deputy executive director at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Here‚Äôs what to know.  3-year pause saved the average borrower $15,000   Former President Donald Trump first announced the stay on federal student loan bills and the accrual of interest in March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic hit the U.S. and crippled the economy. The pause has since been extended eight times. Nearly all people eligible for the relief have taken advantage of it, with less than 1% of qualifying borrowers continuing to make payments on their education debt, according to an analysis by higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.  As a result of the policy, the average borrower likely saved around $15,000 in student loan payments, Kantrowitz said. Why the pause will end in the fall The Education Department notes on its financial aid website that ‚ÄúCongress recently passed a law preventing further extensions of the payment pause.‚Äù It is referring to the agreement reached between Republicans and Democrats to raise the nation‚Äôs debt ceiling, which President Joe Biden signed into law in early June. In exchange for voting to increase the borrowing limit, Republicans demanded large cuts to federal spending. They sought to repeal Biden‚Äôs executive action granting student loan forgiveness, but the Biden administration refused to agree to that. However, included in the deal was a provision that officially terminates the pause at the end of August.  Even before that agreement, the Biden administration had been preparing borrowers for their payments to resume by September. ‚ÄúThe emergency period is over, and we‚Äôre preparing our borrowers to restart,‚Äù Education Secretary Miguel Cardona recently said at a Senate hearing.Interest will pick up in September, payments in October The Education Department says borrowers will be expected to make their first post-pause payment in October. Meanwhile, interest will start accumulating on borrowers‚Äô debt again on Sept. 1, the department says.Exact due dates will vary based on your account details, Kantrowitz said.‚ÄúYour due date will be at least 21 days after you‚Äôre sent a loan statement,‚Äù he said. Borrowers don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôll owe As the Biden administration tries to ready millions of Americans to restart their student loan payments, there‚Äôs one big open question that may make that preparation difficult: Most borrowers don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôll owe in the fall.That‚Äôs because the Supreme Court has yet to issue a verdict on the validity of Biden‚Äôs plan to cancel up to $20,000 in student debt for borrowers. A decision is expected this month. Around 37 million people would be eligible for some loan cancellation, Kantrowitz estimated.  Roughly a third of those with federal student loans, or 14 million people, would have their balances entirely forgiven by the president‚Äôs program, according to an estimate by Kantrowitz. As a result, these borrowers won‚Äôt owe anything come October. For those who still have a balance after the relief, the Education Department has said it plans to ‚Äúre-amortize‚Äù borrowers‚Äô lower debts. That‚Äôs a wonky term that means it will recalculate people‚Äôs monthly payment based on their lower tab and the number of months they have left on their repayment timeline.Kantrowitz provided an example: Let‚Äôs say a person currently owes $30,000 in student loans at a 5% interest rate. Before the pandemic, they would have paid around $320 a month on a 10-year repayment term. If forgiveness goes through and that person gets $10,000 in relief, their total balance would be reduced by a third, and their monthly payment will drop by a third, to roughly $210 a month.  Education Department Undersecretary James Kvaal recently warned that if the administration is unable to deliver on Biden‚Äôs loan forgiveness, delinquency and default rates could skyrocket. The borrowers most in jeopardy of defaulting are those for whom Biden‚Äôs policy would have wiped out their balance entirely, Kvaal said. ‚ÄúUnless the Department is allowed to provide one-time student loan debt relief,‚Äù Kvaal said, ‚Äúwe expect this group of borrowers to have higher loan default rates due to the ongoing confusion about what they owe.‚Äù,;,; 2023-06-20 22:49:52]

Given that it has already passed the 20, and 50 day MA's, this is a strong indicactor that the stock will continue to rise over the following weeks.        https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/013015/why-200-simple-moving-average-sma-so-common-traders-and-analysts.asp#:\~:text=The%20200%2Dday%20SMA%2C%20which,be%20in%20an%20overall%20uptrend.        [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NIO&amp;p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NIO&amp;p=d)        2. Market Stability - Biden is threatening to raise the tariffs in place on Chinese EV's. Why is this a good thing? It's because this is in direct response to Xi telling him that China would take Taiwan. On the 20th it's reported that Xi told Biden that reunification was going to happen (https://abcnews.go.com/International/xi-warns-biden-china-plans-back-taiwan/story?id=105815520). The next day on the 21st Biden's administration says they are weighing on increasing tarriffs on Chinese EV's (https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/biden-administration-explores-raising-tariffs-on-chinese-evs-e439d87d). In other words, Biden is trying to dissuade China from starting a war that would not only crash the entire market (save for Raytheon), but cause the US to implement trade embargos, that all of it's allies would have to sign on to. Therefore, Nio should have long-term stability in it's plan to expand out of China and into Europe, it's next target market. Even so, if Tarrifs are added, the US is not Nio's market given their conservative policies around climate change - see 6 (Environmental Policy Edge)        3. NIO's Strategy - similiar to Tesla, they are a tech-heavy company burning a lot of cash to build next-generation AI into their products. This is reflected in how they also have focused on building premium vehicles first with a high price, before pivoting to build cheaper more affordable vehicles. They just announced a rival to the Porsche the new ET7 Sedan, which they will use to offset their R&amp;D, before beginning manufacturing on their more affordable FireFly model in 2025. What's exciting is the battery in this has a range of up to 1,000KM - almost 200KM more than the Tesla S LR. To add on, NIO produced 100K cars in half the time it took Tesla to (6 years versus 12).        https://www.nio.com/et7        [https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/nio-launch-cheaper-firefly-brand-europe-2024-2023-12-15/](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/nio-launch-cheaper-firefly-brand-europe-2024-2023-12-15/)        4. Scalability - the main issue with the company has been that they are not producing enough cars compared to their competitors like BYD and Li. The issue is again their over-investment in tech over producing cars at scale. In the short-run that isn't great, especially if they get crushed out of the market. However, if they can maintain their size and continued growth, they will be able to surpass their competitors given how far along their technology is. Given that they have just received 2.2 Billion USD and are now sitting on 7 Billion in cash, I think their next moves will be continuing to buy factories for production so they can sell more cars over the next few years.

Battery Technology &amp; Infrastructure - they are the largest swappable battery company, which with rising environmental and sustainability concerns, make their IPs exceeding valuable in the coming years. The cost of replacing a Tesla battery can cost up to 20K whereas the Nio battery can be easily swapped for half the price for up to 10k. In addition with them having built over 2000 battery swapping stations, 3000 charging stations and it only taking 10 minutes to charge 100km (or a 3 min battery swap boasting 250km charge in their new Sedan), their tech is so far ahead of their competitors that they will be the iPhone to the BlackBerry once they have scale.        https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/19/cars/china-nio-investment-hnk-intl/index.html        https://ev-lectron.com/en-ca/blogs/blog/tesla-battery-cost-what-you-need-to-know#:\~:text=How%20much%20is%20a%20battery,replace%20(excluding%20labor%20costs)        https://energy5.com/the-cost-of-owning-and-operating-a-nio-electric-car.

Environmental Policy Edge - with China electing to go all-electric by 2030, producing for the Chinese economy over American is far more profitable over the next decade. Demand for electric is expected to 10x once 2030 hits. This will give them huge scalability compared to European manufacturers, where gas powered vehicles will be banned by 2035. In the US only 9 states have made the move to ban them by 2035, meaning Chinese EV's will have the superior advantage in market share and manufacturing by then.        https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/10/24/electric-cars-10-fold-increase-2023-shift-net-zero/#:\~:text=The%20number%20of%20electric%20cars,Agency%20(IEA)%20has%20said.        https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/states-banning-new-gas-powered-cars/        https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/24/cars/eu-combustion-engine-debate-climate-intl/index.html#:\~:text=When%20EU%20lawmakers%20voted%20to,from%20the%20bloc's%20political%20leaders.        Doubts:        \- They have to invest in more production at this point. In scalability, I said their next moves "will be" continuing to buy more factories. That's an assumption I'm making as it's the next logical step. Their R&amp;D is so far ahead of their peers they have to scale up with the cash they have on hand. I‚Äôm not too worried on market saturation as the Chinese EV market is only projected to reach 8 million vehicles by 2028 (https://www.statista.com/outlook/mmo/electric-vehicles/china)        \- Chinese Subsidies could at any point be removed, and that would greatly hamper NIO's expansion if Xi decided to do so (although I don't think he would). Chinese companies really are at the autonomy of the government so there is always a risk here        \- High inflation could both eat at their cash supply while also stunting their luxury cars sales, resulting in them failing to sell and break even on R&amp;D and losing even more cash in the process. Even though China claims they have had negative inflation at -0.5%, I'd be weary at that figure (https://ycharts.com/indicators/china\_inflation\_rate#:\~:text=China%20Inflation%20Rate%20is%20at,long%20term%20average%20of%201.80%25.) given their history of under/over reporting their economy        \- Continued price wars with Tesla - this has hurt NIO in the past but given the current market, I doubt will be a problem as Tesla has been hurting and even seeing reduced sales in the midst of the price war (https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-price-cuts-electric-cars-losing-business-strategy-2023-11)        In conclusion, I think that NIO has both technical indicators as well as economic and market-based factors that will contribute to propel the stock up over the next decade. This next year will be crucial with Neo's expansion and strategic moves, but I'll be on the lookout in the short run to see whether they are producing more cars or stagnating after their cash injection.        My current holdings are 24 Calls for February 16th at a strike price of $7.50, purchased for an average price of $2.17 each.,;,; 2023-12-28 21:32:38]
[Are EV stocks pretty much done if republicans win in November 2024?,;,; Biden has been making steps to move U.S to green energy which has benefitted companies such as Tesla, Enphase etc.   However, it looks like Trump is declaring all out war on green/clean energy and looks to reverse everything!

[What happened to $TSLA this week?,;,; Welcome my weekly $TSLA update.                **1) Volkswagen confirms talks with Tesla over NACS charging standard.**        Volkswagen is considering using Tesla's charging connector for its electric vehicles in North America, potentially joining Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS). The company is currently in talks with Tesla about adopting this connector for its Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, and future Scout brands in the region.        **2) Tesla set for record quarter in China.**        Analysts predict that Tesla is likely to achieve a new sales record in China despite competition from local rivals. Estimates suggest Tesla could sell around 155,000 cars in China from April to June, marking a 13% increase from the previous quarter, although its market share may decline slightly due to increased competition from companies like BYD and Aion.        **3) Tesla sales forecast for Q2: 440,000-450,000 deliveries.**        As the second quarter comes to a close, Tesla remains the dominant force in the electric vehicle market, with estimated sales forecasts for Q2 ranging from 441,000 to 448,000 vehicles. The Model Y is expected to outpace other models, and while Tesla's production is increasing, concerns arise regarding the gap between production and deliveries. The upcoming release of the Cybertruck and a lower-cost Tesla model are seen as crucial for sustaining Tesla's growth.        **4) Elon vs. Zuck: it's officially happening.**        Tech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have engaged in social media banter about a potential cage fight between them, generating publicity and attention. However, it remains uncertain whether the fight will actually take place, and some speculate that the discussion may serve as a distraction from recent negative news surrounding Meta's decision to cut off news access in Canada and Musk's declining reputation--according to data from Morning Consult.                **PS:** links + update in your inbox every week, [here](https://teslafolder.beehiiv.com/).,;,; 2023-06-29 22:23:03]
[ChargePoint vs Enovix for a long-term EV position?,;,; Looking to invest in EVs, already have a small position in Lucid and exposure to Tesla through a large position in the Nasdaq 100.  On one hand Chargepoint have the largest EV charger network in the world but are facing extreme competition, especially from Tesla's Supercharger network, with increasing adoption of Tesla's charging standard.  Evonix is a stock I recently stumbled across, and has had a very good run so far in 2023, up 56% YTD. They specialise in advanced lithium ion batteries which I believe would be very much in demand by EV companies, so could have major upside potential as the EV market continues to grow, but I do not know much more than this about the stock/company.

[Federal Officials Trade Stock in Companies Their Agencies Oversee,;,; https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-officials-invest-in-companies-their-agencies-oversee-11665489653  Hidden records show thousands of senior executive branch employees owned shares of companies whose fates were directly affected by their employers‚Äô actions, a Wall Street Journal investigation found  Thousands of officials across the government‚Äôs executive branch reported owning or trading stocks that stood to rise or fall with decisions their agencies made, a Wall Street Journal investigation has found.  More than 2,600 officials at agencies from the Commerce Department to the Treasury Department, during both Republican and Democratic administrations, disclosed stock investments in companies while those same companies were lobbying their agencies for favorable policies. That amounts to more than one in five senior federal employees across 50 federal agencies reviewed by the Journal.  A top official at the Environmental Protection Agency reported purchases of oil and gas stocks. The Food and Drug Administration improperly let an official own dozens of food and drug stocks on its no-buy list. A Defense Department official bought stock in a defense company five times before it won new business from the Pentagon.  The Journal obtained and analyzed more than 31,000 financial-disclosure forms for about 12,000 senior career employees, political staff and presidential appointees. The review spans 2016 through 2021 and includes data on about 850,000 financial assets and more than 315,000 trades reported in stocks, bonds and funds by the officials, their spouses or dependent children.  The vast majority of the disclosure forms aren‚Äôt available online or readily accessible. The review amounts to the most comprehensive analysis of investments held by executive-branch officials, who have wide but largely unseen influence over public policy.   Among the Journal‚Äôs findings:  ‚Ä¢ While the government was ramping up scrutiny of big technology companies, more than 1,800 federal officials reported owning or trading at least one of four major tech stocks: Meta Platforms Inc.‚Äôs Facebook, Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.  ‚Ä¢ More than five dozen officials at five agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, reported trading stock in companies shortly before their departments announced enforcement actions, such as charges and settlements, against those companies.  ‚Ä¢ More than 200 senior EPA officials, nearly one in three, reported investments in companies that were lobbying the agency. EPA employees and their family members collectively owned between $400,000 and nearly $2 million in shares of oil and gas companies on average each year between 2016 and 2021.  ‚Ä¢ At the Defense Department, officials in the office of the secretary reported collectively owning between $1.2 million and $3.4 million of stock in aerospace and defense companies on average each year examined by the Journal. Some held stock in Chinese companies while the U.S. was considering blacklisting the companies.  ‚Ä¢ About 70 federal officials reported using riskier financial techniques such as short selling and options trading, with some individual trades valued at between $5 million and $25 million. In all, the forms revealed more than 90,000 trades of stocks during the six-year period reviewed.  ‚Ä¢ When financial holdings caused a conflict, the agencies sometimes simply waived the rules. In most instances identified by the Journal, ethics officials certified that the employees had complied with the rules, which have several exemptions that allow officials to hold stock that conflicts with their agency‚Äôs work. Number of federal officials who reported owning specific tech stocks, 2016-21  Federal agency officials, many of them unknown to the public, wield ‚Äúimmense power and influence over things that impact the day-to-day lives of everyday Americans, such as public health and food safety, diplomatic relations and regulating trade,‚Äù said Don Fox, an ethics lawyer and former general counsel at the U.S. agency that oversees conflict-of-interest rules.  He said many of the examples in the Journal analysis ‚Äúclearly violate the spirit behind the law, which is to maintain the public‚Äôs confidence in the integrity of the government.‚Äù  Some federal officials use investment advisers who direct their stock trading, but such trades still can create conflicts under the law. ‚ÄúThe buck stops with the official,‚Äù said Kathleen Clark, a law professor and former ethics lawyer for the Washington, D.C., government. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the official who could benefit or be harmed‚Ä¶. That can occur regardless of who made the trade.‚Äù  Investing by federal agency officials has drawn far less public attention than that of lawmakers. Congress has long faced criticism for not prohibiting lawmakers from working on matters in which they have a financial interest. The rules were tightened in 2012 by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, passed following a series of Journal articles on congressional trading abuses.  Journal reporting last year on federal judges, revealing that more than 130 jurists heard cases in which they had a financial interest, led to a law passed this May requiring judges to promptly post online any stock trades they make.  This article launches a Journal series on the financial holdings of senior executive-branch employees and, in some instances, conflicts of interest hidden in their disclosure forms.  U.S. law prohibits federal officials from working on any matters that could affect their personal finances. Additional regulations adopted in 1992 direct federal employees to avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest.  The 1978 Ethics in Government Act requires senior federal employees above a certain pay level to file annual financial disclosures listing their income, assets and loans. The financial figures are reported in broad dollar ranges. image A view of Washington, D.C.  Most officials‚Äô financial disclosures are public only upon request. The Journal obtained disclosure forms by filing written requests with each federal agency.  Some made it difficult to obtain the forms, and several agencies haven‚Äôt turned over all of them. The Department of Homeland Security hasn‚Äôt provided any financial records. (See an accompanying article on methodology.)  Under federal regulations, investments of $15,000 or less in individual stocks aren‚Äôt considered potential conflicts, nor are holdings of $50,000 or less in mutual funds that focus on a specific industry. The law doesn‚Äôt restrict investing in diversified funds.  Some federal officials, especially those at the most senior levels, sell all their individual stocks when they enter the government to avoid the appearance of a conflict.  The Office of Government Ethics, which oversees the conflict-of-interest rules across the executive branch, is ‚Äúcommitted to transparency and citizen oversight of government,‚Äù said a spokeswoman. She said the agency publishes financial disclosures of the most senior officials on its website, along with instructions for getting disclosures from other agencies.  At the EPA, an official named Michael Molina and his husband owned oil and gas stocks while Mr. Molina was serving as senior adviser to the deputy EPA administrator, according to agency records. Such companies stood to benefit from former President Donald Trump‚Äôs pledge to promote energy production by rolling back environmental regulations and speeding up projects.  Mr. Molina‚Äôs job gave him a front-row seat to deliberations about environmental regulations relating to energy. He ‚Äúreviews and coordinates sensitive reports, documents and other materials,‚Äù said his job description, provided by the EPA in response to a public-records request. He served as a ‚Äúpersonal and confidential representative‚Äù of the EPA deputy administrator in communications with the White House and Congress, according to the job description.  In the month he started the job, May 2018, Mr. Molina reported purchases totaling between $16,002 and $65,000 of stock in Cheniere Energy Inc., a leading producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. He reported adding Cheniere stock five additional times over the next year. At the time, senior EPA officials were encouraging the production of natural gas in the U.S.  Reported trades in energy and mining firms;  made by spouse through a financial adviser  The trades were made through a financial adviser in his husband‚Äôs account, according to emails and disclosure forms reviewed by the Journal. Mr. Molina was required to enter the trades into the EPA‚Äôs electronic-disclosure system within 30 days of receiving notice of the transactions, under the 2012 STOCK Act.  Officials are responsible for ensuring that their holdings don‚Äôt conflict with their work, regardless of whether they use a financial adviser. The Journal‚Äôs review of disclosures shows that many federal officials tell their financial advisers to avoid investing in certain industries or to shed specific stocks.  In an interview on Sept. 28, Mr. Molina indicated that he didn‚Äôt know much about the energy trades. ‚ÄúI can say this on the record: I didn‚Äôt even know what Cheniere was until 36 hours ago,‚Äù he said.  In February 2019, Mr. Molina was promoted to EPA deputy chief of staff. He attended scores of meetings on environmental issues, reviewed matters for the then-head of the agency, Andrew Wheeler, and was sometimes asked his opinions in meetings, according to records reviewed by the Journal and people familiar with the matter.  In about 2¬Ω years at the EPA, Mr. Molina reported more than 100 trades in energy and mining companies including Duke Energy Corp., NextEra Energy Inc. and BP PLC. About 20 of the transactions were for between $15,001 and $50,000 each, according to Mr. Molina‚Äôs disclosures. Those trades also were made for his husband by his financial adviser.  In the month he was promoted, February 2019, his husband made several stock purchases through the adviser in Cheniere and Williams Cos., which builds and operates natural-gas pipelines.  Two months later, Mr. Trump said the EPA would propose new rules to help the gas industry.  After publication of this article, Mr. Molina said in a written statement: ‚ÄúNeither I nor my husband knew about or directed any of these trades. Our financial advisor had complete discretion to trade in the account, and these same trades were made on behalf of a ‚Äòpool‚Äô of several dozen clients‚Äînot for us individually.‚Äù  Mr. Molina left the EPA in January 2021. An EPA spokeswoman said the agency‚Äôs ethics office ‚Äúcounseled Mr. Molina on his ethics and financial disclosure obligations.‚Äù EPA officials signed Mr. Molina‚Äôs financial-disclosure statement in each year he worked at the agency, an indication they believed he was in compliance with the conflict-of-interest rules.  U.S. law leaves it to individual agencies to decide whether they need rules to beef up the federal conflict-of-interest law. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission explicitly bars its officials from investing in natural gas, interstate oil pipeline, utility and other energy firms.  The EPA doesn‚Äôt have additional agencywide rules. A spokeswoman for the EPA said its officials may invest in energy companies so long as they aren‚Äôt working on policies that could affect their investments. Mr. Molina‚Äôs boss told ethics officials that he had no influence over public policy matters.  Greg Zacharias was the chief scientist for the Defense Department‚Äôs director of operational test and evaluation until last fall. He repeatedly bought stock in a defense contractor in the weeks before the Pentagon announced it would pay the company $1 billion to deliver more F-35 combat jets, while his division was overseeing testing of those planes.  Mr. Zacharias made five purchases of Lockheed Martin Corp. stock, collectively worth $20,700, in August and September 2021, according to figures he provided. On Sept. 24, 2021, the Defense Department said it was buying 16 F-35 jets from Lockheed for the Air Force and Marine Corps. Lockheed shares closed up 1.1% the next trading day. The stock made up a small part of Mr. Zacharias‚Äôs portfolio.  Mr. Zacharias‚Äôs office had been involved for years in overseeing testing of combat jets, and testing officials regularly met with the Pentagon‚Äôs F-35 Joint Program Office and with Lockheed directly, according to former defense officials. Mr. Zacharias, who provided scientific and technical expertise on how to assess the effectiveness of weapons systems, didn‚Äôt attend those meetings.  In an interview, Mr. Zacharias said he wasn‚Äôt involved in decisions on contracting and had no inside knowledge ahead of the contract, beyond the public information that the Pentagon remained committed to the F-35 program. He acknowledged that his role could have allowed him to access information about specific weapons systems. ‚ÄúI could always walk downstairs and ask them how it‚Äôs going. But that really wasn‚Äôt an interest of mine,‚Äù he said, adding that his focus was emerging technologies.  Mr. Zacharias said he wanted to buy stock in defense contractors, including Lockheed, because of their dominance of the defense market. He said he didn‚Äôt pay much attention to the timing of trades, adding: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just the pipe-smoking science guy.‚Äù  The Lockheed investments were among more than 50 trades Mr. Zacharias reported in about a half-dozen defense contractors in 2020 and 2021, according to the Journal‚Äôs analysis.  ‚ÄúI apologize that things don‚Äôt look good on the buy side,‚Äù Mr. Zacharias added. Of the trades in defense contractors, he said: ‚ÄúI just decided that would be a good investment at the time.‚Äù  He said ethics officials didn‚Äôt raise concerns about his trades in Lockheed or any of the other defense contractors he reported investments in, beyond periodically sending a letter reminding him not to take part in contract negotiations involving the companies. He said ethics rules could be ‚Äúa little tighter.‚Äù  A Pentagon spokeswoman said Mr. Zacharias ‚Äúworked with his supervisor and ethics officials to implement appropriate disqualifications.‚Äù She said the department requires supervisors to screen their employees‚Äô disclosures for conflicts in addition to the review conducted by ethics officials. Ethics officials certified that he complied with the law.  Some conflicts of interest stemmed from agencies‚Äô misunderstanding of their own rules.  The FDA prohibits employees, their spouses and their minor children from investing in companies that are ‚Äúsignificantly regulated‚Äù by the agency. The FDA maintains an online list of the prohibited companies for officials to check.  An FDA official named Malcolm Bertoni disclosed that he and his wife owned stock in about 70 pharmaceutical, diagnostics, medical device and food companies regulated by the agency in 2018 and 2019, including drug giants Pfizer Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. All were on the prohibited list.  Mr. Bertoni, a career executive, ran the FDA‚Äôs planning office from 2008 to 2019, researching and analyzing agency programs. Most of the investments he reported were in the range of $1,001 to $15,000, but his 2019 disclosure showed he and his wife owned between $15,001 and $50,000 in each of Allergan PLC, Sanofi SA, Takeda and Zoetis Inc.  Mr. Bertoni‚Äôs lawyer, Charles Borden, said Mr. Bertoni and his wife held these stocks despite the bans because they got bad advice from the FDA ethics office.  The stocks were in accounts managed by professionals who had discretion to trade without the knowledge of Mr. Bertoni or his wife, the attorney said. He said that years ago, Mr. Bertoni asked the ethics office how he should treat the accounts and was told they fell into an exception to the rules for mutual funds.  They did not. The ethics office discovered its error in a routine review of Mr. Bertoni‚Äôs forms in early 2019, Mr. Borden said. ‚ÄúThe FDA‚Äôs Office of Ethics and Integrity took full responsibility for the inaccurate guidance given to Mr. Bertoni,‚Äù the attorney said in an email.  After considering the tax and retirement-planning consequences of having to sell the stocks, and other personal factors, Mr. Bertoni chose to retire instead, his lawyer said.  An FDA spokesman said Mr. Bertoni was recused from matters involving the companies once he reported his family‚Äôs holdings in them. The spokesman declined to comment on the events leading up to his departure.  ‚ÄúThe FDA takes seriously its obligation to help ensure that decisions made, and actions taken, by the agency and its employees, are not, nor appear to be, tainted by any question of conflict of interest,‚Äù said the spokesman.  When federal officials are found to have violated conflicts rules and are referred to criminal authorities, they often receive light punishment if any, according to records reviewed by the Journal.  Valerie Hardy-Mahoney, a lawyer who runs the National Labor Relations Board‚Äôs Oakland, Calif.-based regional office, held Tesla Inc. shares as her office pursued complaints against the auto maker and Chief Executive Elon Musk and considered whether to file more.  Members of the labor relations board, appointed by the president, review decisions made by agency administrative courts. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney acts as a prosecutor in those courts. She is a career employee who joined the NLRB in the 1980s.  Ms. Hardy-Mahoney‚Äôs office filed complaints against Tesla in 2017 and 2018. She reported holding Tesla shares worth $1,001 to $15,000 in 2019 while those cases were ongoing. The next year, her disclosure form shows, she owned Tesla shares valued at between $30,002 and $100,000 in E*Trade accounts. She purchased two chunks of Tesla stock in August 2020, each valued at between $1,001 and $15,000, according to her disclosure form.  The NLRB ruled in March 2021 that Tesla had illegally fired an employee involved in union organizing and that Mr. Musk, in a tweet, had coerced employees by threatening them with the loss of stock options if they unionized. It ordered Tesla to reinstate the employee and Mr. Musk to delete the tweet. Tesla has disputed the findings and has appealed the decision to a federal appeals court.  Ms. Hardy-Mahoney‚Äôs office has in other cases rejected charges against Tesla filed by employees, including allegations her office received in 2020, after she bought more Tesla stock, according to an NLRB case docket. An employee who worked at the Tesla Gigafactory alleged that the company interfered with workers‚Äô rights. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney‚Äôs office dismissed the charge in January 2021.  Last November, an NLRB ethics official declined to certify that Ms. Hardy-Mahoney was in compliance with ethics laws and regulations, according to her disclosure form.  The NLRB‚Äôs inspector general said in a report that his office had substantiated an allegation of violating federal law by participating in a matter in which an employee had a financial interest. An agency spokeswoman confirmed that the report involved Ms. Hardy-Mahoney.  The report said that the matter was referred to the local U.S. attorney‚Äôs office, but that federal prosecutors declined to take it. The report said the subject of the report‚ÄîMs. Hardy-Mahoney‚Äîreceived additional training regarding financial conflicts of interest and the case was closed.  Ms. Hardy-Mahoney declined to comment. She recused herself from Tesla cases last year and now is in compliance with conflict-of-interest rules, the NLRB spokeswoman said.  At the Federal Reserve, an economist named Min Wei reported trades in stock of a marijuana company after the Fed sought clarity about whether banks could serve cannabis businesses. A Fed spokeswoman said the trades were made by Ms. Wei‚Äôs husband.  In June 2018, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said publicly that the issue put the central bank ‚Äúin a very, very difficult position.‚Äù Even though its mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, Mr. Powell said, he ‚Äújust would love to see‚Äù a clear policy on the matter.  Because Mr. Powell didn‚Äôt dismiss the idea, investors saw the comment as bullish for cannabis companies such as Tilray Brands Inc., a leading producer. Tilray went public the following month, and its stock skyrocketed.  In early September 2018, Ms. Wei‚Äôs husband bought between $480,005 and $1.1 million of Tilray shares, according to her disclosure form and the Fed. The stock continued to surge.  It then became clear that neither the Fed nor the Treasury would take action; it would be up to Congress, with no quick fix in sight. In October, shares of cannabis companies began to fall.  Ms. Wei‚Äôs husband sold his Tilray stake in five sales in early October. By then, the shares had nearly doubled, worth between $800,005 and $1.75 million, according to Ms. Wei‚Äôs disclosure.  The Fed imposed new restrictions this year on investing by bank presidents, Fed board governors and senior staff after the Journal reported questionable trading by presidents of two Fed banks, who subsequently resigned. The new rules prohibit trading individual stocks and bonds and require that trades, even in mutual funds, be preapproved and prescheduled.  The new Fed rules for top people don‚Äôt apply to Ms. Wei because she isn‚Äôt senior enough. The trades were ‚Äúpermissible then and are permissible now,‚Äù said the Fed spokeswoman.  Ms. Wei referred questions to the Fed. The spokeswoman said Ms. Wei had ‚Äúno responsibility or involvement with policy decisions related to bank supervision or the provision of banking services.‚Äù She said the Fed ‚Äúdid not assert any interest at the time in the Federal Reserve resolving the conflict between federal and state law in the area of cannabis companies and their access to banking services, but rather pointed out that the appropriate resolution of those issues should come from the Congress.‚Äù  Ethics lawyers said trading such large amounts of an individual stock while the Fed is publicly addressing an issue creates an appearance problem, even if Ms. Wei‚Äôs trades didn‚Äôt violate conflicts rules. image The Federal Reserve building in Washington.  Roughly seven dozen federal officials reported more than 500 financial transactions apiece over the six-year period analyzed by the Journal. Some traded a single stock frequently, while others reported hundreds or even thousands of trades across a broad array of stocks, bonds and funds.  In one instance, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission permitted short sales contrary to one of the CFTC‚Äôs own rules.  The financial disclosure of Lihong McPhail, an economist at the CFTC, showed the most trading reported by any federal official in the Journal‚Äôs review. Her husband made more than 9,500 trades in 2020‚Äîan average of about 38 each trading day, according to her disclosure form and the CFTC.  About one-third of those reported 2020 trades‚Äî2,994‚Äîinvolved shorting stocks, or betting on a fall in their price. They ranged from Amazon to Ford Motor Co. to Zoom Video Communications Inc. The CFTC said all the short sales were made by her husband.  Over the years, to safeguard the CFTC‚Äôs integrity, Congress imposed tighter restrictions than at other agencies on employees‚Äô investing. In amending the Commodity Exchange Act, Congress also declared that any breach by a CFTC employee of an investment rule set by the commission could be punishable by up to a $500,000 fine and five years in prison. The CFTC‚Äôs role doesn‚Äôt include regulating stocks, but in 2002, the agency adopted a rule banning short selling by its employees and their families.  Nonetheless, a CFTC ethics official approved short selling by Ms. McPhail‚Äôs husband, Joseph McPhail, a CFTC spokesman said, fearing that the commission ‚Äúcould possibly be sued by the employee if we said no.‚Äù The spokesman said the ethics office believed the regulatory provision exceeded the commission‚Äôs statutory authority.  Mr. McPhail referred questions to the CFTC. The CFTC spokesman said he didn‚Äôt speak for the McPhails. Ms. McPhail didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment.  At the CFTC, ‚Äúemployees are required by statute and by regulations to adhere to strict ethical standards and to disclose personal investments to ensure that the work of the CFTC to oversee markets is free from any conflict of interest,‚Äù said the agency spokesman. ‚ÄúIn this instance, several years ago the employee sought advice regarding their spouse‚Äôs investments and received approval from career ethics counsel.‚Äù  Mr. McPhail was a senior policy analyst at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. until September 2021. In a written statement, that agency said: ‚ÄúThe FDIC expects our employees, as public servants, to devote their time and efforts to our mission to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation‚Äôs banking system.‚Äù  The Defense Department was among the federal agencies with the most officials who invested in Chinese stocks, even as the Pentagon in recent years has shifted its focus to countering China.  Across the federal government, more than 400 officials owned or traded Chinese company stocks, including officials at the State Department and White House, the Journal found. Their investments amounted to between $1.9 million and $6.6 million on average a year.  Reed Werner, while serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense for south and southeast Asia, in December 2020 reported a purchase of between $15,001 and $50,000 of stock in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  At the time, discussions were under way at the Pentagon over whether to add the Chinese e-commerce giant to a list of companies in which Americans were barred from investing because of their alleged ties to the Chinese government.  Defense and State officials pushed to add the company to the blacklist, while the Treasury feared this would have wide capital-markets ramifications. Mr. Werner had been involved over a period of months in some discussions about what companies to add to the blacklist, former defense officials said.  Nearly two weeks after the Alibaba purchase, the Treasury updated its list and didn‚Äôt include Alibaba. The company‚Äôs stock rose 4% that day.  Three days later, Mr. Werner‚Äôs financial-disclosure form shows a sale of between $15,001 and $50,000 of Alibaba stock.  The sale came a day before a meeting where defense officials planned to press their case for adding Alibaba and two other companies to the blacklist. Then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ultimately blocked the effort.  In an interview, Mr. Werner acknowledged he was involved in discussions about adding Alibaba to the list, saying he attended a meeting in late 2020 and was on an email chain about the matter. He said that he wasn‚Äôt involved in blacklist discussions during the period the Alibaba trades were made, and that the trades resulted in a $1,556.51 gain. He declined to answer further questions.  The Pentagon spokeswoman said that the officials who formally compiled and approved the blacklist didn‚Äôt own stock in affected companies, and that supervisors and ethics officials review reports for holdings that could conflict with an employee‚Äôs duties. Ethics officials certified that Mr. Werner complied with the law.  At least 15 other defense officials in the office of the secretary reported that they or family members owned or traded Alibaba between 2016 and 2021, including Jack Wilmer, who served as senior cybersecurity adviser at the White House and then as the Pentagon‚Äôs top cybersecurity official.  Between 2018 and 2020, Mr. Wilmer reported at least six trades, which he said totaled around $10,000, in the Chinese companies Alibaba, search-engine giant Baidu Inc. and China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp.  Mr. Wilmer said that a money manager handles his trades and that he didn‚Äôt direct any of those transactions. He said he wasn‚Äôt involved in policy-making decisions that would have affected those stocks and said he didn‚Äôt see a conflict between his job and investments. He left the government in July 2020, before Mr. Trump signed the executive order barring Americans from investing in certain Chinese companies.  Within federal agencies, ethics officials generally don‚Äôt consider it their job to investigate whether employees are making stock trades based on information they glean from their government jobs. Ethics officials‚Äô ability to spot potential conflicts is limited because they usually don‚Äôt know what employees are working on.  When ethics officials do see a potential violation, they can refer it to their agencies‚Äô inspectors general, who refer cases on to the Justice Department if they find evidence of wrongdoing.  A Journal review of inspector general reports showed that the offices rarely investigated financial conflicts. As more federal officials invest in the stock market, ethics officials say they have less time to look into possible wrongdoing. When findings have been referred to the Justice Department, prosecutors in most cases have declined to open an investigation.  One matter at the Securities and Exchange Commission involved an official who failed to report or clear his and his spouse‚Äôs financial holdings and trades for at least seven years. The trades included stocks that SEC employees and their families weren‚Äôt allowed to own, some of which the SEC inspector general determined posed a conflict with the official‚Äôs work, according to a report the inspector general provided to Congress.  When a U.S. attorney declined to prosecute, the SEC‚Äôs inspector general reported the findings to SEC management. The unnamed official ultimately was suspended for seven days and gave up 16 hours of leave time.  The SEC declined to comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on individual investigations but said: ‚ÄúWe take all inspector general referrals seriously and bring charges when the facts and law support them, consistent with the principles of federal prosecution.‚Äù Share Your Thoughts  Are stock trading rules for federal officials OK or should they be further restricted? Join the conversation below.  Most federal agencies don‚Äôt have protocols to verify that officials‚Äô financial disclosures are complete. One Agriculture Department official disclosed wheat, corn and soybean futures and options trades. The Journal discovered that he had made additional large trades in corn and soybean futures in 2018 and 2019 and omitted them from his reports.  The official, Clare Carlson, who is no longer at the USDA, said that he tried to be scrupulous in his disclosures, and that the omissions were honest mistakes. The Agriculture Department declined to comment.  At the EPA, Mr. Molina‚Äôs financial-disclosure reporting caught the attention of ethics officials.  The conflict-of-interest rules say executive-branch employees may not ‚Äúparticipate personally and substantially‚Äù in matters that have a ‚Äúdirect and predictable effect‚Äù on their investments and those of family members.  When the ethics officials contacted Mr. Molina about energy stocks he reported on his forms, they were told he didn‚Äôt have any influence over environmental policy.  His ‚Äúduties are administrative in nature,‚Äù his boss, the EPA‚Äôs chief of staff at the time, told the ethics officials. ‚ÄúHe provides logistical support to the principal but does not participate personally and substantially in making any decisions, recommendations or advice that will have any direct or substantial effect‚Äù on his financial interests, the chief of staff said, according to Mr. Molina‚Äôs financial disclosure.  In his time at the EPA, Mr. Molina clashed with ethics officials. Many of his financial disclosure reports were inaccurate and tardy, according to EPA emails reviewed by the Journal. At one point, he didn‚Äôt file accurate monthly trading disclosures for 12 months, according to the EPA emails. Mr. Molina reported the stock trades on his annual financial reports, as required.  Ethics officials said they contacted Mr. Molina ‚Äúscores‚Äù of times to press him to file timely reports, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.  In one email, a senior ethics official said his office had ‚Äúprovided you with at least 3-5 times more personal assistance than for any other agency employee, yet the required ethics reports were still late.‚Äù  Mr. Molina told EPA officials that he initially didn‚Äôt know he was supposed to complete regular stock-trading reports. He later struggled to keep up with the EPA‚Äôs electronic-disclosure system, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.  In September 2020, the EPA fined Mr. Molina $3,200 for numerous failures to disclose stock trades to the agency on time. Mr. Molina refused to pay.  ‚ÄúWe have never before had an employee refuse to pay the late fee,‚Äù wrote one ethics officer in an email to Mr. Molina on Oct. 21, 2020, ‚Äúso I will have to inquire about how to commence garnishment proceedings.‚Äù  The next month, Mr. Molina accused ethics officials of discriminating against him. ‚ÄúI feel that I am being targeted and have been asked to report more than anyone else,‚Äù he wrote in a Nov. 3, 2020, email.  ‚ÄúIf the intent of these filings is to curb any corruption or misbehavior,‚Äù Mr. Molina wrote, the EPA should open an investigation. ‚ÄúI believe that paying such an outrageous fine would be an admission that I have done something wrong in this regard.‚Äù  Ethics officials didn‚Äôt investigate Mr. Molina‚Äôs trades or refer the matter to internal investigators.  On the evening of Jan. 19, 2021, Mr. Molina‚Äôs final day working for the government, EPA ethics officials offered to end the matter if he paid a discounted fine of $1,067.  Mr. Molina wrote out a personal check to ‚ÄúU.S. Treasury‚Äù and sent it to officials in the EPA‚Äôs ethics office, including to Justina Fugh, an official with whom he had clashed.,;,; 2023-05-09 11:47:25]
[Tech leaders are calling for an A.I. pause because they have no product ready, Palantir CEO says,;,; https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/09/tech-leaders-ai-pause-no-product-ready-palantir.html  Palantir‚Äôs boss Alex Karp opposes the idea of a pause in artificial intelligence research, in contrast to an open letter from the Future of Life Institute signed by some of the biggest names in the tech industry. The letter, which has garnered over 31,000 signatures including names like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, called for a pause on AI research on models larger than GPT-4, which powers tools such as ChatGPT. The letter also said that if ‚Äúsuch a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.‚Äù Speaking to BBC Radio in an interview broadcast Thursday, Karp said he is of the view that ‚Äúmany of the people asking for a pause, are asking for a pause because they have no product.‚Äù  He added, without naming anyone, that this is because ‚Äúpeople who have nothing to offer want to study AI,‚Äù but by taking a pause, this could lead to adversaries stealing a lead in not only commercial applications, but also military applications. To him, ‚Äústudying this and allowing other people to win both on commercial areas and on the battlefield‚Äù is a really bad strategy. When asked if what he wanted was an ‚ÄúA.I. race‚Äù akin to the arms race of the Cold War, Karp simply stated that ‚Äúthere is already an A.I. arms race, it‚Äôs just we‚Äôre ahead, [and] it‚Äôs not like if we slow down, the AI race will stop.‚Äù  He pointed out that the ‚Äúsingle most important event‚Äù in this race is not large language models like GPT-4, but instead how AI has been utilized in military applications. Karp points out that Ukrainian forces have used Palantir technologies to gain a technological edge over invading Russian forces. A report from The Times in December 2022 revealed that Palantir‚Äôs AI has allowed Ukraine to increase the accuracy, speed and deadliness of its artillery strikes despite having comparatively smaller artillery forces. Palantir sells software to governments and private sector organizations which help them analyze large quantities of data. The advent of this AI-powered software on the battlefield ‚Äújust throws down a gauntlet to every single country in the world,‚Äù Karp said. He added, ‚Äúespecially [to] our adversaries, they cannot afford for us to have this advantage. And so, the race is on. There‚Äôs only a question of do we stay ahead or do we cede the lead.‚Äù,;,; 2023-06-09 12:24:41]

[Uber/Lyft doomed with autonomous vehicles?,;,; I commonly hear of story suggesting that Uber/Lyft would be doomed once fully autonomous cars become mainstream. The reasoning being, Tesla for example, can start their own ride sharing service, putting their own inventory at work.  While there is a good chance of this happening, I do not agree with it. My argument is, it is not scalable to do for a car manufacturer.   Uber and Lyft have an edge because of its nature of business. They continue to be a gig worker company where people who own autonomous cars put their car at work, just like today, but without a driver. So cars work for owners and Uber simply takes a cut.

[BLOOMBERG: Chaos in the Red Sea Is Starting to Bite Into Companies‚Äô Profits,;,; My View -  Red Sea crisis continues to affect many sectors across the world. Diversion via Cape of Good Hope (i.e. skip the faster route via Suez Canal) requires huge supply of oil and other necessities throughout the voyage. The additional cost and time inevitably damage companies' profits as well as pump up inflation.  &amp;#x200B;  **BLOOMBERG: Chaos in the Red Sea Is Starting to Bite Into Companies‚Äô Profits**  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-23/shipping-chaos-tesla-tesco-others-warn-of-impact](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-23/shipping-chaos-tesla-tesco-others-warn-of-impact)  *With the Red Sea crisis roiling shipments of everything from cars to energy, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before soaring costs and supply-chain strains show up in companies‚Äô earnings reports.*  *Several firms are already warning of the impact. Electric vehicle maker Tesla plans a two-week production halt at a German plant due shipment delays, while Sweden‚Äôs Volvocar AB has announced a three-day stoppage at its Belgian factory. British retailers Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer Group and Next have all flagged the risk of higher prices for consumers.*  *This is due to at least 2,300 ships taking lengthy detours to avoid Houthi militants‚Äô attacks in the Red Sea ‚Äî a waterway that normally handles over 12% of global sea trade. Central bankers are warning of an inflation surge that could hamper interest-rate cuts. For many companies, especially in Europe, it‚Äôs adding to transit times, padding out freight bills and raising insurance costs. It's also forcing analysts to rethink companies‚Äô earnings estimates for the coming year.*  *In the past three months, the consensus forecast for car-makers‚Äô earnings is down 5%, data shows. Shippers on the other hand are emerging as winners ‚Äî with container rates surging 300% on some routes, earnings estimates for MSCI Europe‚Äôs transportation index have risen 7% in just two weeks.*  *Thomas Brenier, head of equities at Lazard Freres Gestion in Paris, has trimmed exposure to the auto sector, seeing it as "one of the first to suffer due to its complex and tense supply chain.‚Äù He is also avoiding retail, as it "could suffer from a lack of products to sell.‚Äù*  *"If it lasts another one or two months, for sure you will see some profit warnings linked to this,‚Äù Brenier predicted.*  *Here‚Äôs a look at how earnings could shape up for various sectors:*  *1. Shipping and insurance*  *It is estimated that current container shipping costs, if sustained, could add to headline inflation in the U.K. and euro area from late 2024 and early 2025.*  *But the events are boosting the fortunes of global shipping companies, such as AP Moller‚Äî Maersk A/S and Hapag-Lloyd AG in Europe, U.S.-listed ZIM Integrated Shipping and Japan‚Äôs Mitsui OSK Lines. Insurers should also benefit, with underwriters jacking up premiums tenfold on some shipping routes.*  *Among shippers, Maersk has enjoyed a slew of bullish recommendations. Bank of America recently doubled 2024 earnings estimates for the Danish firm, while Goldman Sachs Group reckons a massive increase in free-cash flow could allow it to return capital to shareholders.*  *David Vernon at Sanford C Bernstein and Co. predicts an earnings boost for logistics firms too, including freight forwarders, if companies that run out of shipping options resort to airfreight.*  *"Air freight are absolutely the winners,‚Äù Vernon said, naming FedEx, United Parcel Service and DHL Group as potential beneficiaries.*  *2. Retailers*  *Next, which sources most of its fashion and home products from Asia, was among the first retailers to voice fears of a hit.*  *Primark, which is owned by Associated British Foods, and Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB are highly exposed to sea freight volumes, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Richard Chamberlain, while Zara owner Inditex SA sources mostly from nearby countries. Similarly, Bryan Garnier &amp; Co. highlights French furniture retailer Maisons du Monde SA as highly vulnerable, procuring 75% of its goods from Asia and transporting 90% by sea.*  *Prolonged disruption will pull in global brands such as Nike, Adidas AG and Capri Holdings, Bernstein said.*  *The problem for such companies is that the economic backdrop can make it harder to pass higher costs to consumers. "Companies may have to absorb them, which would crimp profit margins,‚Äù Fr√©d√©rique Carrier at RBC Wealth Management said.*  *3. Autos*  *So far, Tesla and Volvo Car are the only auto makers to announce production stoppages. But such delays "may represent a fresh risk to light vehicle production this year,‚Äù according to Morgan Stanley.*  *However, most reckon the industry won‚Äôt see a repeat of COVID-19 era problems. "Costlier fuel, extra days of space rented, and higher shipping rates are going to be a negative on companies‚Äô P&amp;Ls, but, putting this in perspective, transportation costs are about 57% lower than COVID levels,‚Äù BofA analyst John Murphy wrote.*  *The crisis could even allow automakers to maintain higher vehicle prices.*  *4. Energy*  *The impact on crude prices has been relatively muted this year, but that could change if a prolonged conflict causes supply shortfalls.*  *However, oil markets are bracing for weeks-long disruptions. Fewer tankers are traversing the Bab el-Mandeb strait at the southern end of the Red Sea, according to Vortexa data. The number of ships carrying crude or dirty petroleum products such as fuel oil, have slid by 25% this year up to Friday versus a year earlier, the figures show.*  &amp;#x200B;  Other related posts shared earlier,  **Red Sea disruption prolonged may curb effort in fighting inflation and delay interest rate cuts, pressure on stock markets**    [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/198186g/red\_sea\_disruption\_prolonged\_may\_curb\_effort\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/198186g/red_sea_disruption_prolonged_may_curb_effort_in/)       **Red Sea crisis is causing global supply chain disruptions and more**    [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/194d2ux/red\_sea\_crisis\_is\_causing\_global\_supply\_chain/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/194d2ux/red_sea_crisis_is_causing_global_supply_chain/)  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2024-01-23 11:13:10]

[Why do Lithium battery and electric car stocks seem to consistently start high and taper hard?,;,; I've been taking a deep dive into the electric car and lithium battery industries in hopes of finding solid investment opportunities, and I've come across a consistent trend. Many of these companies spike massively when they go public, and ultimately come crashing down to a seemingly endless flat streak at penny stock values. Examples of this include Rivian (RIVN), Nikola (NKLA), and a battery manufacturer Microvast (MVST). Understandably, electric vehicles is a hard industry to break out in, especially here in the US where adoption of the technology and infrastructure has been underwhelming, and there is a singular giant already filling much of the space that these companies are vying for. What I'm confused about, is why do these companies fall so flat? They obviously aren't Tesla and aren't enjoying success to the same degree that Tesla does, but at least in my area, Rivian vehicles are a regular sight. Nikola just got a pretty solid deal to sell 30+ trucks to a major US trucking company, and Microvast is one of the only companies of its kind with a real marketable product. How is it that these companies can trade so low compared to their industry leader? What is it that I'm missing?

Investors are using that as an opportunity to get out.  They have pulled a net $717 million from the ARK Innovation ETF over the past 12 months, according to FactSet. That exodus marks a notable shift for a fund that had consistently drawn investor cash since its 2014 inception. Once the largest actively managed ETF with nearly $30 billion in assets under management, the fund has shrunk to roughly $9 billion, mostly due to investment losses.  Known by its ticker symbol ARKK, Wood‚Äôs fund became an investor darling shortly after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic with hugely successful bets on unprofitable and ‚Äúdisruptive‚Äù technology companies. It took in huge amounts of investor money, culminating with a $6.5 billion inflow in the first quarter of 2021, when its share price peaked.  Then, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs fastest interest-rate hiking campaign in decades crushed the valuations of unprofitable growth companies, which often attract investors when interest rates are low and returns on safer investments such as CDs are minimal. Shares of ARKK plunged 67% in 2022, but its investors largely held on or bought the dip. Now, analysts say they expect some of those investors are getting out for good.  ‚ÄúYou have a whole group of people who got in somewhere near the top and are sitting on horrific losses,‚Äù said Matthew Tuttle, chief executive of Tuttle Capital Management, which operates an inverse ETF that lets investors bet against Wood‚Äôs fund. ‚ÄúI think some of those people have said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm never getting back to even; this is probably the best I‚Äôm going to do, and it‚Äôs time to get out.‚Äô‚Äù  Wood says the outflows have been small compared with the fund‚Äôs assets.  ‚ÄúWe have been astonished at our asset retention since February of ‚Äò21,‚Äù Wood said in an interview. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very small number as a percentage of assets, which suggests that it‚Äôs far more likely to be people who are taking some profits than some exodus of people who have stayed in the fund through a prolonged down period.‚Äù  Despite the recent rally, ARKK shares are trading about 70% below their all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 has climbed 17% this year on hopes the Fed is near the end of its tightening effort; it is still down 6.1% from its early 2022 high.  ARKK‚Äôs top five holdings are Tesla, Coinbase Global, Roku, Zoom Video Communications and Block. Only Tesla and Zoom were profitable last year. Tesla holds an 11% weight in the fund, helping power its advance this year. Shares of the electric-vehicle maker have more than doubled in 2023 but, like ARKK, are down sharply from their previous high.  Although technology stocks are strongly back in favor this year, the best performers have mostly been mature, profitable companies that generate significant cash, such as Microsoft and Amazon.com. Unlike two years ago, investors appear to have less interest and patience for companies that aren‚Äôt expected to turn a profit until years in the future. Higher interest rates have meant there is a much higher opportunity cost to wait for profitability.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs certainly been a change in sentiment from when the ARK funds were doing really well,‚Äù said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF data and analytics at CFRA Research. ‚ÄúA lot of the stocks the ETF holds won‚Äôt have big cash flows until way out in the future, and it‚Äôs a more challenging environment for that with rates expected to be higher for longer.‚Äù  Investors say the ARK brand lost its luster after the fund‚Äôs prodigious fall. It took another hit after missing out on the monster rally in shares of Nvidia, the graphics-chip maker at the heart of the boom of interest in artificial-intelligence technology. ARKK sold the last of its Nvidia position in January, a stake that had long been one of its largest holdings. Nvidia has been the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs best performer this year, more than tripling.  ‚ÄúThe bloom is off the rose a little bit,‚Äù Tuttle said.  Wood says the negative publicity over the past two years has been an opportunity for ARK to solidify its brand as an asset manager focused on disruptive innovation.  ‚ÄúI can tell you at the end of ‚Äô20 and early ‚Äò21, when we couldn‚Äôt do anything wrong and people were just chasing, I felt very uncomfortable,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúToday, I feel very comfortable. We are not seeing that kind of behavior. That tells me there is a wall of worry out there. And that usually sustains a bull market.‚Äù  The outflows at ARK are coming while ETF investors appear eager to put money to work in other funds. June was the best month for equity ETF flows since October, according to State Street, while active funds attracted $10 billion of inflows for the month and more than $100 billion over the past 12 months.  Investors displayed ‚Äúchildlike exuberance‚Äù and ‚Äújumped into the market‚Äôs rally with both feet,‚Äù Matthew Bartolini, head of Americas research for State Street‚Äôs ETF business, said in a research note.  The ARKK fund has an 11% annualized average return since inception, but the average ARKK investor has lost 21% on a dollar-weighted, annualized basis, according to FactSet.  ‚ÄúARKK shareholders have not timed their purchases well. Many bought high and have yet to sell,‚Äù said Elisabeth Kashner, director of global funds research at FactSet.  The fund remains a cash cow for Wood, who owns a majority stake in its parent company, ARK Investment Management. Its 0.75% annual fee is about double the average fee for active ETFs.  Although fee revenue is well off its 2021 peak, ARKK has generated more than $20 million of fees this year. ARK Investment Management currently has the third-highest daily revenue from active equity ETFs, of at least 145 different issuers, according to an analysis from FactSet.  To be sure, the market comeback staged by many of ARKK‚Äôs tech-focused holdings surprised many, highlighting the perils of trying to forecast performance.  ‚ÄúIf you just look at rates, you would not have expected this great rebound in growth coming into the year,‚Äù said Dana D‚ÄôAuria, co-chief investment officer at Envestnet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a classic window into why market prognostication doesn‚Äôt work. Who would have thought artificial intelligence would boom and create this massive interest?‚Äù  https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-are-bailing-on-cathie-woods-popular-ark-fund-dbf5d801?mod=hp_lead_pos2,;,; 2023-07-16 21:48:07]
[This doesn't feel sustainable for a nearly $1 TRILLION Company!,;,; tl;dr at bottom   Not trying to start a debate, I'm not long or short $NVDA, don't own any, and I don't plan to open a position anytime soon, I'm just your monthly buyer of $VOO and $QQQ.    However, to the bulls out there, what is the reason for such a MASSIVE premium for this stock?  I understand they crushed earnings and increased foecast to a nearly 50% gain in revenue by Q1 2024, but even with that premium, they are trading at a nearly 200 P/E.    Assuming NVDA maintains that 50% premium and holds it for all 4-quarters in 2024, thats $44B in revenue which if they had 100% margins and zero cost of any kind, it would take you almost 22 years to payback the value of the stock.   Sure, someone will tell me P/Es don't matter, and they are growing like crazy, but at what point is the value of the stock (again, almost $1 TRILLION) still out of control?   \- Their Gross Profit is 56% which is impressive, but not unherd of (MSFT is 68%, META is 80%)    \- Their net income is 16% which is right in line with everyones favoriate not a car company TESLA at 15%  Lets throw out fundamentals since they clearly don't matter that much for this stock and look at their growth:  $7.19B (lower than Q1 2022 of $8.29B).    Their Q4 22 Revenue was $6.05B vs. Q4 21 of $7.64B  So grow is slower/stagnant from the previsous years, so why does that get such a massive premium?  Did they beat earnings estimates, yes, but those were concervitive.  Did they raise guidance by 50% due to the AI boom, yeah, how long will that last?  Same length as the gaming/crypto/at home boom?  Okay, then what, revenue falls again?      TL;dr   People talk about $TSLA being over valued, I've never seen a stock like $NVDA before being this "overvalued" in my life.

[Stocks for shorting in 2024 -Would you?,;,; The last quarter of 2023 (October-December) saw a strong rally in the US stock market, particularly in November and December. While various stocks saw impressive gains, the top performers varied depending on the specific timeframe and metric used (e.g., absolute gain, percentage gain, market cap). Here are some options to consider:        Overall Top Performers:        AppLovin (APP): +255.9% year-to-date (based on 2023 performance), driven by strong AI-powered advertising performance and positive financials.    Symbotic Inc. (SYM): +154.5% in the last quarter, boosted by rapid revenue growth in supply chain automation and AI adoption by major retailers.    Nvidia (NVDA): +122.5% in the last quarter, fueled by booming data center business and optimism about AI applications.    Meta Platforms (META): +85.4% in the last quarter, rebounding from a 2022 downturn thanks to recovering online advertising demand.    Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL): +68.7% in the last quarter, as travel and leisure stocks benefited from easing pandemic concerns.    Other notable gainers:        Palo Alto Networks (PANW): +48.5% in the last quarter, driven by cybersecurity demand amid increasing cyber threats.    Tesla (TSLA): +44.2% in the last quarter, propelled by positive electric vehicle deliveries and production ramp-up.    PulteGroup (PHM): +43.2% in the last quarter, buoyed by strong housing market trends and favorable mortgage rates.    Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): +42.1% in the last quarter, benefiting from chip shortages and robust demand for its processors.    Carnival Corporation (CCL): +41.3% in the last quarter, mirroring RCL's recovery in the cruise line industry.,;,; 2023-12-30 15:08:48]

[Short sellers are betting more than $1 trillion against US stocks after big run,;,; * Total US short interest exceeded $1 trillion as of last Friday, S3 Partners data shows. * The top five shorts are mega-cap tech stocks Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon * That comes after big stock market gains so far this year.  US short interest this month rose to the highest level since April 2022, as investors bet that the current bull run in the stock market is set to falter.  According to data from S3 Partners, the amount spent by short sellers against US stocks hit $1.02 trillion, as of Friday. Those bets came even as they continued to rally earlier this month, costing short sellers $101 billion.  S3 data shows that the top shorts are Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. As of Friday, their collective short interest topped $83 billion.  The bearish sentiment results from skepticism about how much higher stocks can go. So far this year, the S&amp;P 500 is up 13.5%, and the Nasdaq is up 29%.  But since the Federal Reserve last week indicated more rate hikes are on the table this year, stocks have been on a losing streak.  This year, Wall Street has been caught up in the hype over artificial intelligence companies, which saw their valuations skyrocket and have brought more investors into the market due to "fear of missing out."  But big names have voiced divided outlooks on the AI frenzy. For instance, while Stanley Druckenmiller sees Nvidia as a stock worth holding for the next couple of years, short seller Jim Chanos has demonstrated skepticism towards the stock.  Meanwhile, the prospect of continued hawkishness from the Fed has added to macroeconomic risks. A recent Goldman Sachs report put the odds of a recession in the next 12 months at 25% and warned a downturn could cause a 23% decline in the S&amp;P 500.  Still, if bullish investors win out, short positions could eventually support market gains, as a short squeeze forces more buying and boosts stocks.,;,; 2023-06-24 10:48:34]

[Where are you building positions?,;,; I have a very small portfolio, about 14k. Over the last few years I lost a very, very substantial amount of money as a % of my portfolio making stupid trades. Mostly trying to be too cute with long dated call options that went terribly in the wrong direction and expired worthless, credit spreads, chasing some WSB tickers. Basically trading like I'm in a literal casino.  The last 18 months or so I've mostly gotten back on the right track and have been building positions in the big names that have been traditionally good bets over a long horizon. Google, apple, Amazon, meta, tesla, Microsoft, Nvidia, visa, you get the idea. I recently started a new job and can comfortably put $1000 a month into the market to chase some growth while equally contributing to my savings.  Something nearly all of these companies have in common is that they are all hovering at or near 52 week highs and while I'm not entirely deterred by that it gives me some pause.  Personally my next thought is to build a bigger position in the s&amp;p and nasdaq indices over the next few months since I'm currently concentrated in individual companies.

[Why is no one bullish on CHPT?,;,; DISCLAIMER:  I don't know shit and I have NEVER tried to  make a case for a particular stock.  There are about 2 million EVs on the road today.  Projections are to sell 4 million by the end of 2024.  So that's a 200% increase in charging demand.Chargepoint has more chargers than anyone but Tesla.  In many places public charging is at capacity.  I don't see any way things don't take off but most of what  i read says CHPT is a big risk with a questionable future.  If you were having this conversation after the dot com bubble in 2000 you might say "wow, Amazon is really on its ass".  But even then  the internet was growing by 20% a month and Amazon was the best online retailer.    So  no matter how bad it looked, there was no scenario you could envision that would take amazon out of the  equation.  I feel like we are in a similar moment.  EV growth is inevitable.   All you have to do is suck less than your competitors and CHPT seems to meet that criteria.     EDIT:   Thanks for all the replies. I learned a lot.

[Berlin, Intel strike deal on $33 billion chip plant after months of subsidy talks,;,; BERLIN/STOCKHOLM, June 19 (Reuters) - Intel (INTC.O) will invest more than 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in Germany as part of its expansion push in Europe, the U.S. company said on Monday, a project key to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ambitions to create a global chip hub.        The deal, which involves two leading-edge semiconductor facilities, involves 10 billion euros in German subsidies, a person familiar with the matter said.        Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said he was grateful to the German government and the local state of Saxony-Anhalt, where the company plans to built one plant, for "fulfilling the vision of a vibrant, sustainable, leading-edge semiconductor industry in Germany and the EU".        Under Gelsinger, Intel (INTC.O) has been investing billions in building factories across three continents to restore its dominance in chipmaking and better compete with rivals AMD (AMD.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Samsung (005930.KS).        The deal in Germany would be Intel's third big investment in four days, following a $4.6 billion chip plant in Poland and a $25 billion factory in Israel.        Both the United States and Europe are trying to lure big industrial players via a mix of state subsidies and favourable legislation, with Berlin concerned about losing appeal as a place to invest.        The German government is investing billions of euros in subsidies to lure tech companies to Germany amidst growing alarm over supply chain fragility and dependence on South Korea and Taiwan for chips.        Berlin is currently also talking with Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) and Sweden's electric vehicle battery maker Northvolt about setting up production in Germany, having already convinced Tesla (TSLA.O) to build its first European gigafactory there.        Frankfurt-listed Intel shares were 0.3% lower at 1316 GMT.        The chipmaker last year announced plans to build a big chip complex in Germany, along with facilities in Ireland and France, as it seeks to benefit from the European Commission's eased funding rules and subsidies as the EU tries to cut its dependence on U.S. and Asian supply.        It has not yet specified the exact size of the investment.        Gelsinger told Reuters on Friday that the gap between what Germany had offered and what Intel needed was too big but he expected to reach an agreement, adding that his request was to be cost competitive.        "We lost this industry to Asia, we have to be competitive if we're going to bring it back," he said, adding the overall investment for the site would be "tens of billions of dollars".

Feel free to correct any info here or add on more. Just looking to start a discussion on the different hot topics lately and the following stock picks that go along with them! I know there are several other big opportunities like weed,crypto,etc just didn‚Äôt wanna go overboard   **Lithium ( MALRY, LAC)**   The booming EV market, along awith the growing demand for renewable energy storage, positions lithium as a key investment opportunity. Major automaker's substantial investments in EVs drive the need for lithium-ion batteries, while the increasing focus on sustainable energy ensures a sustained demand for lithium. Despite global lithium deposits, the challenge of securing a stable and cost-effective supply persists, presenting investment potential in companies involved in lithium exploration, mining, and battery production.     **GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, INTL )**   Demand for GPUs comes from AI and machine learning for handling big data in areas like healthcare and finance. Data centers need GPUs for cloud computing as businesses shift operations online. In the gaming industry, GPUs are crucial for high-quality graphics in video games. Cryptocurrency mining, particularly for coins like Ethereum, relies on GPUs for their processing power. Overall, the demand is driven by the growing need for high-performance GPUs in AI, data centers, gaming, and cryptocurrency mining.   **Uranium (BHP, NXE )**   The demand for uranium primarily stems from its crucial role in fueling nuclear power generation. As global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources intensify, the demand for nuclear energy has been on the rise, particularly in emerging economies like China and India. This growing demand, coupled with supply constraints and geopolitical factors affecting uranium production, creates a decent investment opportunity. As countries strive to meet their energy needs while minimizing carbon emissions, uranium stands out as a key component in the clean energy landscape.   &amp;#x200B;  Are you betting on any of these?

[I always wondered,;,; Hello, how easy is the process of buying stocks? Lets say it is tuesday morning, i wake up and decide to buy one tesla stock. I open this app, have some money transactions, and here it is? Now i wait for it to go up or down, then i decide to sell it. No papers no documents?  My parents always said, i quote "this is scam, because it is easy to put money in the app, 2 clicks, thats it, but really hard to take it out, they ask you to call him, pay this, click that, your id your phone number and you end up loosing your money".  I am tired of seeing people explain the basics, but they end up not talking about this.  I never even tried investing, but this seems really interesting, making 5 dollars a day is pretty cool as a teenager.  Thanks!,;,; 2023-09-17 15:51:29]
[In 5 Years, Who do You Think Comes out on Top in the AI wars?,;,; Microsoft?  Amazon?  Google?  Apple?  Even maybe Palantir?  Nvidia?  Or more than 1 of them?   I think Microsoft is currently the best positioned with it's larger market share with Azure right now,  but Amazon is catching up with Lex and all of the AWS products.  Google seems way behind both companies.   Microsoft (at least right now) is also the most logically and fairly valued P/E wise (unlike say, Nvidia's astronomical PE) and I may dabble with a few grand bc it's cheap.   They also have good cash on hand and good EPS.    Not sure what to make of Apple or PLTR in the AI game, with PLTR some people say their products are the best and most proprietary and others are just "meh" on PLTR and say they are super overvalued.    So who do you guys think will come out on top in the next few years in the AI arena? ,;,; 2023-09-05 23:48:37]

[Are ETF values tied to the stocks they contain?,;,; So, I understand how stocks go up and down, someone buys and someone sells, the value of the company has no impact other than what people are willing to pay to be part owners.  What I don‚Äôt understand is how ETFs get their value. Is it the same thing, just buying and selling at a certain price or do the values of the companies within them matter. If you had an ETF that was 25% Apple, Tesla, MSFT, and Google, and Apple went up, would the ETF price automatically go up? trying to reconcile how sale price works while also understanding how something like VOO can track perfectly with the S&amp;P.,;,; 2023-10-04 18:36:40]

[Headfirst into the $RIVN pool,;,; I like the stock, what can I say?  Before I go further, this is just a discussion post, not necessarily a ‚Äútechnical analysis‚Äù.  Full disclosure, I‚Äôve just recently yeeted into a decent chunk of my portfolio into Rivian averaging $15.50/share.  Yes, they keep asking for offerings for multiple billions of dollars in new funding, but it‚Äôs for the right reasons, and theoretically the correct results of in just a few years increasing their production capacity from 25k to over 500k. It takes massive capital to due this feat. Something I don‚Äôt think any other EV brand outside of TSLA is able to do, while also having the most superior product in the industry.   The even better news being the demand has only skyrocketed, and (hope I don‚Äôt jinx it with upcoming quarterly report) there doesn‚Äôt seem to be signs of slowing demand. Which is huge because right now their cheapest car is $80k, and they‚Äôre soon announcing their $40k line that should supplement their existing $80k lines and commercial delivery truck lines to hit their max 500k capacity.  To me, my yolo bolo brain. It does not seem like a bizzare bet that in 2026 they sell at their 500k capacity as their popularity within the United States is still climbing, and launching an affordable line is only going to increase interest.   Not to mention it‚Äôs a severely superior car to any Tesla line, and SUV/Trucks are largely preferred over sedans in the wealth class that can afford these vehicles in the U.S.,;,; 2024-02-09 18:37:20]

[BYD stock - pro's and con's?,;,; Hi everyone.  I am living in Denmark where the BYD Dolphin has just been introduced. I was amazed by the price which in Denmark is WAY lower than ID.3, Model 3, and other competitors. Even though the bells and whistles might be missing, the warranty and the things most important to most - how far can it drive on a charge, etc, - is looking very good.   So I think BYD is going to overtake Tesla and the others at least in the very small market in Denmark. Which leads me to think it might also be the case in other European countries. And BYD is as far as I can read and research one of the largest Chinese automobile sellers and one of the biggest battery manufactures in the world. So they have a lot going for it.  BUT, the stock is OTC (not on one of the usual exhanges) and it seems it did a largest price jump some 4 years back where the value quadrupled.   SO, I am wondering if there's a catch? Is the value fair? Should I be worried over OTC?  Thank you for your input!,;,; 2023-08-12 13:14:03]
[What's your largest individual stock holding? (No shilling, please).,;,; Howdy everybody. Lately, I've been investing more in individual stocks that are undervalued, as opposed to putting it in ETF's that are at ATH. Thus far, my strategy has outperformed the overall market by quite a bit. I'm up 20% since starting this strategy about 6 months ago, versus the overall market being up by about 10% in the same time period. Yes, I understand there's inherently more risk with individual stocks. Also, FWIW, I'm not bragging, just giving some depth to the conversation and my reasoning for asking these questions. Anyway, moving on. I'm looking to expand that number of individual stock holdings, but also diversity into new holdings as opposed to taking bigger positions on what I already own. Im looking for crowd favorites for individual stock holdings. So my question to you all is this: For those who don't have *all* of their money in ETF's, what is the single stock you hold the most of? How much of that holding represents your overall portfolio? Are these long-term holdings, or have you purchased shares lately? Why is that particular stock your largest individual holding?   I'll leave mine out for the time being because I don't want this to come across as a shilling post or for it to devolve into an argument. I genuinely want to know what you guys are holding. So, how about it, people? What are you holding?,;,; 2023-12-20 07:28:01]

[30yo looking for stock advice,;,;  Opened my brokerage account at the beginning of the pandemic and have been consistently putting money in. Currently about 70k in the account, split 80% mutual/ETF and 20% individual stocks. The individual stocks I have purchased at the beginning of my journey when I did not know much about the market and they are the source of unrealized losses, including tesla, biontech, Moderna, alibaba, apple. Now, I wish to be more safe and put my money in mutual/ETF. My question is should I sell the individual stocks within the next year or two or try to hold onto them since they make up only a small part of my portfolio and they may make improve in the long term?  Edit: the 80% are put in low fee index funds and have gained enough to offset the loss.

Their cars are genuinely good in almost every way and I think it is one of the few true competitors to Tesla. It is sad that they don't plan to have an economic car for the regular folks.

[Even the best investors in the world make mistakes, Charles Munger " investment in Alibaba was one of the worst mistakes I ever made.‚Äù,;,;    **Munger bought his initial stake at around $246 per share.**  Munger was probably convinced this was a passing phase and things will get back to normal after Jack Ma is ‚Äútaught‚Äù a lesson in adhering to the government line. He doubled down and kept adding as the stock kept falling. He added substantial quantities in the July-September quarter around $182 and again in the October-December quarter around $145. Each time he nearly doubled his position from before. He probably realised his mistake and sold half his position in the January-March quarter of 2022 ..  Munger said he remains optimistic about China‚Äôs economy, but conceded that Daily Journal‚Äôs investment in Alibaba was ‚Äúone of the worst mistakes I ever made.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI never stopped to think \[Alibaba\] was still a retailer.

[Any European bank employees who trade stocks without informing their bank?,;,; I have started working in a bank however I don't communicate with customers at all. In fact I am not directly invvolved in the main finance division. The rules are that even if you work as a cleaner in the bank you must inform the bank with a paper about your stock trade. Like if I sell my 10 USD worth McDonald's stocks I need to go to X floor and fill a paper. Like how much the exchange rate for USD, my order time, stock execution time etc. And I am buyung stocks like Tesla, Apple, Virgin Galactic, Microsoft etc. Is it possible that these big US companies end up buying credits or something like that from an east European country? And if so, let's say Apple bought Microsoft via the bank I am working. And the stock went 100%. Then because most of my stock are 200 USD worth, I will earn 200 USD at best case.

Is this a good idea to buy $1000 worth of stock for each company? What are the pros and cons of doing this? Is there any other companies I should consider?,;,; 2023-07-01 01:52:21]

[WSJ: More Auto Payments Are Late, Exposing Cracks in Consumer Credit,;,; Before you read [the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-auto-payments-are-late-exposing-cracks-in-consumer-credit-3cbc2382?mod=markets_lead_pos1), here are some additional statistics and graphs from the article and elsewhere. The WSJ article focuses among consumers with the worst credit scores.  ## Data about credit scores:  - [Distribution of credit scores](https://i.imgur.com/OXAcVNj.png) as of April 2022, from a [CNBC article](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/19/how-to-get-your-credit-score-above-800.html) in January 2023 (please share updated data if you can find it). The WSJ article defines subprime as sub 660, which is roughly around 25-30% of US consumers with credit scores. - Average credit score is around 710 currently ([Business Insider in October 2022 citing Experian data from 2021](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/average-credit-score)). It was 687 in 2010. [Here is a table for all ages, using 2021 data](https://i.imgur.com/YDiojl8.png). Minnesota has the highest average at 742, while Mississippi averages 681.  ## Auto loan data:  - [Graph of share of 30 days or more delinquent *subprime* (sub 660) *auto* debt](https://i.imgur.com/HHYsgQx.png) - [Graph of share of 30 days or more delinquent *subprime* (sub 660) *auto* debt, broken down by credit score](https://i.imgur.com/io1LliF.png). The trend for those sub 660 is pretty unremarkable, and it is those sub 580 credit score really seeing a big uptick. This is the bottom 15% roughly of US consumers with credit scores (see first graph). - What about across *all* credit scores? Well the share *auto* delinquent more than *90 days* is 3.73% [as of Q4 2022](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_auto_loans_delinquent_by_90_days); more than *60 days* is 1.84% ([CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/04/auto-loan-delinquencies-rise-what-to-do-if-you-struggle-with-payments.html) on Feb 4). I couldn't find the most recent 30 day or more auto delinquency rate but from Ally Bank it appears to be around 2-3%. Beware of some fear-mongering when you hear statistics like 'delinquencies rose 30%' because often it's a move from say 2% to 2.6%; the level is already very low so the percentage change is not very meaningful. - The subprime (&lt; 660 credit score) *auto* delinquency rate for 30 days or more debt is 9.3% - [Student loan debt and auto debt](https://i.imgur.com/9SakTFo.png) is a relatively small portion of overall household debt. It's still mostly mortgage debt like it has always been. So this is not going to trigger a 2008 meltdown on its own.  &gt; # More Auto Payments Are Late, Exposing Cracks in Consumer Credit &gt;  &gt; ## Borrowers with low credit scores fall behind in numbers unseen since 2010 &gt;  &gt; The U.S. economy is on a steady footing and the unemployment rate is superlow. Yet a rising number of Americans are falling behind on their car payments.  &gt;  &gt; Some **9.3% of auto loans** extended to people with **low credit scores** were **30 or more days behind on payments at the end of last year**, the **highest share since 2010**, according to an analysis by Moody‚Äôs Analytics. &gt;  &gt; The past few years have been unusually good for consumers, who stowed away extra money during the pandemic, but sky-high inflation is eating away at those gains. Car prices, in particular, jumped because of a shortage of vehicles. Many borrowers took out large loans to buy them, leaving little breathing room to keep up with payments if they hit a rough patch. &gt;  &gt; ‚ÄúThe households that were on the financial ledge to begin with might have been tipped to the point where it‚Äôs hard to keep up on the car loan and everything else, and people have to make some very hard decisions,‚Äù said Pamela Foohey, a professor at Cardozo School of Law who studies consumer law. &gt;  &gt; Stress in the auto-loan market is **concentrated among borrowers with credit scores below 660** and is especially high among people with bottom of the barrel credit. But the stress could spread if the U.S. goes into a recession, as many economists expect. If job losses increase, many more consumers might find themselves unable to keep up with the record amounts of debt they took out in recent years. &gt;  &gt;  &gt; [...] Borrowers who took out big loans at the height of the boom owe far more than their vehicles are worth. Those buyers are sticking lenders with bigger losses when they fall behind. &gt;  &gt; Ally Financial Inc., which operates a large auto-lending business, said in January that the **loans it extended between mid-2021 and mid-2022 are experiencing bigger early losses than its other loans**. In the **fourth quarter, the percentage of its car loans that were more than 60 days past due rose above prepandemic levels for the first time**. &gt;  &gt; Car prices peaked when borrowers‚Äô financial profiles looked especially strong. Consumers had received government stimulus and cut back on spending early in the pandemic, which padded their savings. Then stock prices surged, and a booming economy helped people land hefty raises. &gt;  &gt; Consumers‚Äô credit scores rose, which might have made underwriting less precise, according to Ryan Nash, an analyst at Goldman Sachs who covers banks. Lenders were able to make big loans to borrowers, sometimes on the assumption that their finances had strengthened permanently.  &gt;  &gt; ‚Äú2021 was a bit of the Wild West in the auto market,‚Äù Mr. Nash said.  &gt;  &gt; Nearly **a fifth of banks said they eased credit standards for auto-loan applicants in the first half of 202**1, according to a Federal Reserve survey of senior loan officers, while more than **a 10th did in the second half.** Many said they lowered minimum credit score requirements that year.  &gt;  &gt; Consumer lawyers said that when cars were in short supply during that time, some dealers were able to sell vehicles that were in worse condition, increasing the risk that they would break down or require major repairs. A key reason borrowers stop paying is that the car stops working. &gt;  &gt; ‚ÄúWe get a tremendous number of calls from people who bought cars that never should have been put on the road,‚Äù said Daniel Blinn, a Connecticut-based attorney who has sued dealerships and auto lenders. &gt;  &gt; The number of **people losing their cars to repossession rose 11% in 2022** but remains **below prepandemic levels**, according to estimates by Cox Automotive based on wholesale auctions and default rates. &gt;,;,; 2023-02-19 00:10:41]

[Tech stocks have completed their largest three-week surge since the early days of COVID in April 2020.,;,; Tech investors are entering the Thanksgiving season with optimism as the Nasdaq rises 2.4% in a week, marking a 12% gain over three weeks‚Äîthe strongest rally since April 2020. Intel stands out as the week's biggest winner among large-cap tech stocks, surging 13%, driven by robust demand for PCs following better-than-expected profit and sales reports. Mizuho Securities upgraded Intel to a buy rating, citing a renewed focus on the data center business and positive prospects in the customer pipeline.  Next week, the spotlight shifts to semiconductors, with Nvidia set to report results. The stock has surged 22% in three weeks, boasting a year-to-date gain of 237%, outpacing other S&amp;P 500 members. Nvidia's strong performance is attributed to its role in generative artificial intelligence, providing graphics processing units (GPUs) for powerful workloads. Analysts expect revenue growth of over 170% for Q3 and anticipate Nvidia's forecast to suggest close to 200% growth in Q4.  Eric Jackson, founder of EMJ Capital, considers Nvidia his "top large-cap name" and sees the tech market in the early stages of a rebound, linked to the potential end of Federal Reserve rate hikes. The market is sensitive to interest rates, with low costs encouraging risk-taking and higher rates directing investors to safer assets.  Tame U.S. inflation data, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) remaining flat in October, boosts the broader market. The week's large-cap gainers also include Tesla, rising 9.2%, despite CEO Elon Musk's controversial social media post. Musk's comments drew condemnation from the White House for promoting antisemitic and racist hate, contrasting with American core values.,;,; 2023-11-18 11:03:41]

[Large Covered call position TSLA,;,; A while back wanted to try a holding w/ options strategy, Long story short I wound up with 600 shares of TSLA with an average price of $189..  Im also covered with calls at a $200 strike. The original strike date was October, but I have since then rolled the calls twice, now ending in December. Each contract when rolled a month pays about $400\~ which means I can hypothetically earn up to $2400 a month just rolling these calls since they are so deep ITM. Some of these holdings, however, are on margin. My idea is pretty much to keep rolling the calls and taking the monthly premium, but I am open to other ideas, as I feel stagnant.

[Advice on a TSLA short put.,;,; Hey all, I'm fairly new to options and would appreciate a little advice please.  I have sold the Dec 1st 220 put on TSLA that is now pretty deep ITM, having rolled a few times, it's now $2700 to close. Since I started and with rolling I've made $750 in premiums. So net im down $1950.  Long term I'm happy to own the shares and did own 100 previously. Sold at 240 ish moved platforms and started selling CSPs. The plan was to earn some premium and get back in cheaper- which even at 220 i guess is still the case.  Obviously things could get much worse before they get better for the stock... what are my options or next move?  1) Ride it out a few more weeks in hope the stock bounces back or at least the extrinsic value has all but gone then get assigned at 220. 2) Roll even further out at 220 or below to get more premium but tie the capital up for longer. 3) Take my loss now, buy to close the put, then buy shares now and start selling CCs (above my cost basis while i can).  Any advice on dealing with an ITM CSP would be gratefully received. Thanks.  Edit: Expiry date clarification,;,; 2023-10-30 18:54:15]

[Closing out a big TSLA covered call before it expires today,;,; Sold 42 TSLA 9/29/23 $245 call contracts on 8/18/23 when TSLA was around $215. Big mistake. Only made 17k on those contracts and TSLA jumped a few days after to $260. Potential loss of 100k.  In a 45 day span, TSLA stock went from $215 to $275 and then now back to $248. Contracts were worth 17k on 8/18/23, then 120k on 9/12/13 and now back to 15k.  Now that the contacts are about to expire, and near their strike price, I would like to buy back the contracts, so I won't be hit with a big tax bill. The contacts are now worth around 15k, so I'm also not losing money here.  How late into the trading day today can I safely buy back those contacts?

[Selling deep ITM covered calls on TSLA/NVDA for 4% monthly returns?,;,; YouTube recommended this guy to me who says he makes 4% every month selling deep ITM covered calls on NVDA and TSLA. He is selling somewhere around the .80 delta calls to extract the extrinsic value from the options and planning to take assignment. He says he makes around 48%+ annualized returns doing this (4% per month \* 12 months), which I'm highly skeptical about. Here is the [NVDA video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDM6Be0KeA) and the [TSLA video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2RuTls6AQA) I'm referring to.  Here's a current example I came up with for TSLA using this method ([view on OptionsProfitCalculator here](http://opcalc.com/QIa)):  * Buy 100 shares of TSLA at $196.48. * Sell the 3/31 170C for $33.25 (\~32 DTE). * Total cost = $19,648 - $3,325 = $16,323 (breakeven at $163.23). * Your shares get called away at $170 each, for a gain of $677 (4.15% return on the $16,323 of capital). * Rinse and repeat monthly.  I know there's no such thing as a free lunch, so I'm trying to figure out what the trade-offs are.  Here are the downsides I can think of:  * The stock could drop below your breakeven causing you to take an unrealized loss. * Wash sale rule could cause tax implications if you rebuy shares that are called away without waiting 31 days (i.e. must pay taxes on the full premium received, but can't write off the "loss" of the shares). * There is no upside potential if the stock moves higher.  And the upsides:  * Lower risk to the downside on the trade (compared to selling OTM covered calls). * If the stock does drop significantly, your cost-basis/breakeven has been lowered considerably (down to $163.23 from $196.48).  It seems like this is effectively the same as selling a cash-secured put (e.g. selling the 3/31 170P for $5.60), except this strategy returns about 20% more premium.  This is only possible due to the high volatility of these two stocks, right? A few other tickers I've checked don't return anywhere near 4% premium monthly using this strategy.  What do you guys think about this? Is there anything else I'm missing here?,;,; 2023-02-27 07:02:42]

Help on evaluation.,;,; im thinking about a Long 16FEB2024 260/200 C/P strangle play on TSLA visualized here  https://imgur.com/a/XZqseMe  But when it comes to long option plays, i never know how to evaluate if its worth the risk/reward ratio. the only thing i know about it is to base it off IV percentile and compare it to HV percentile.  basing it off that, TOS shows IVP as 21% and HVP as 11%. so strictly basing it off IV, it is currently overpriced (historically speaking).  its raw IV is is 50.74% however, so i dont feel like theres much IV crush here. The biggest play im aiming at here would be Delta (although that feels unintuitive)  what else should i be thinking about here? how is this TSLA play?  With the dip today in TSLA, my entry point is as follows  1. at open, ensure there isnt a much gap from todays close price. (here idk what is a good % target is considered "to big of a gap". how would I quantitatively determine this?)  2. if criteria 1 is matched, open a 20 delta strangle (so delta neutral)  3. leading up to earnings day, close if profit is X% (what target should i have here?)  4. hold if criteria 3 doesnt match. my risk tolerance will be $x that im willing to lose. so if need be, id be fine with holding till expiration. but most likely will aim to close at X% gain or Y% loss after earnings day.

[$TSLA covered calls post-earnings?,;,; Like many, I was caught picking up pennies in front of the steam roller that is TSLA and have covered calls that are deep ITM.  I know the typical advice here is "let the shares be called away; max profit; etc." However, for many reasons (mostly the massive tax hit), this would not be most efficient thing to do.  I have August covered calls from $160-185 and another 3,000 shares that are uncovered.  Rolling up and out for Even/credit is damn near impossible because the options are so deep ITM.  I don't mind chasing the share price this way for a long time as long as the stock does not keep shooting straight up -- today is a relief.  Debating whether to sell some shares to make cash and BTC the cc's.  Or sell more cc's with the remaining shares and use the premium to BTC. Or something else?  **TL;DR: What should I do post-earnings and on a big red day like today to improve my position and retain the greatest number of shares long term?**  Don't need to hear "max profit," "shouldn't have sold those strikes," etc.  I know that.,;,; 2023-07-20 18:07:02]
[TSLA short straddles going into earnings,;,; tldr;  shorted TSLA ATM $285 strike 7/21 expiration) around earnings.  Short resulted in a net credit of $21.97 per C/P pair of contracts.  Closed at market open morning after earnings report for debit of $12.81  Profit of  9.16 (71.5%)  Risks that should considered:  1. American options can be executed at any time before expiration. So you could end up short or long the underlying. Be prepared for what to do in that case. 2. If underlying  experiences a sudden increase in volatility due to news or event, your short may be at a loss and closing limit order not execute leaving you short options that may end up ITM and assigned. 3. \-----------  The idea is probably obvious, but I'll explain in case it's not.  IV is relatively high as a company heads into earnings. Shorting day of earnings, wouldn've probably been better.  TSLA reported after market close 7/19. Hence IV is theoretically highest that day before earnings.  IV drops, along with options premiums after results are reported. If a company dramatically beats or misses expectations, one leg of the straddle will increase, while the other drops.  Because results were reported after market clothes, options trades can't be executed until the next day's open on 7/20. Hers's my diary and results of the trade.  1. 7/17: Placed limit  and executed order at current market price  to short C/P straddle($285 strike 7/21 expiration). Resulted in a net credit of $21.97 per C/P pair of contracts. 2. Immediately placed a limit GTC order to close for a profit I would be happy with (12.97, $9, 70% profit) . It's important  not get greedy, watch minute charts, and to  try to time the market perfectly. Take your profit and be happy. 3. The closing order executed at market open the morning after earnings on 7/20. It executed at a price slightly lower than my  my limit ($12.81) . This means the lowest ask price was lower than the limit I had initially set ND NET profit greater than my initial closing limit order.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-07-21 18:11:30]

[Covered Call,;,; Hi all,  I just have a quick question regarding how you could possibly lose money with covered calls.  Let's use Tesla as an example:  TSLA 10/11 Share Price: 263.00  Buy 100 shares for $26,300  Write TSLA Call 11/17 (37 days) Strike Price 285.00, 8.50  Collect $850 of premium, $850/$26,300 = 3.231% ROE for 37/365 days or 31.873% annual  If Called, TSLA &gt; $285, contract exercised, Sell 100 TSLA shares @ $285  $28,500/$26,300 = 8.365% ROE for 37/365 days or 82.5205% annual.  If OTM, TSLA &lt; $285, contract expires worthless. 0$.  T-bills are currently at 5.42% or .549% for 37/365 days.  I understand the obvious risk is that TSLA would decline in share price and would lose value that way, but why does it matter if it's a stock planned on keeping in my portfolio. If the contract isn't exercised, the contract could be written again next month for more passive income. I understand this strategy places a cap on the maximum rate of return, but for the average investor this makes way more logical sense to me than risk-free investments (t-bills, CDs, HYSA), (given they have the initial capital outlay to have 100 shares of a company within a diversified portfolio). I know that this is disregarding taxes that would lower these figures, but they would still be higher than risk-free investments.  Am I missing something or is this a passive income method logical?,;,; 2023-10-11 21:31:08]

[I need a bigger brain‚Ä¶,;,; (Have re-written this bc the way I wrote it before seemed to miss the point). I‚Äôm buying a property at a 40% discount in exchange for an all cash transaction (due diligence checks out, it‚Äôs a great purchase, sellers are just under duress due to an imminent  balloon payment and cannot refinance).   I was going to cash in some of my TSLA stock to pay for it (kinda tired of Musk), but found out I can just pull the needed cash straight out of my margin account at 8.6%  Hmmm, I make 2-3X that interest amount by selling covered calls against those TSLA shares, and did not want to sell them at today‚Äôs price anyway, so I‚Äôm keeping the shares a while and using the margin cash instead (new territory for me).  On to the question‚Ä¶ I (erroneously) thought margin interest did not accrue until the transaction settled in two days so my original question dealt with churning the account to keep the margin in flux and avoid interest accrual long term. My brokerage pointed out that interest accrues for two days after the balance is cleared BUT since interest accrues seven days per week, if I sold a bunch of shares on Wednesday, it clears the margin account by Friday and I don‚Äôt pay interest for those weekend days (2/7 equals 28% reduction in interest). At this point the question is more of a thought experiment or learning exercuse, but here is where I needed a bigger brain. What sort of strategy or spread could I do that capitalizes on churning this way?  Like liquidating a few hundred shares every Wed with the intent of buying them back to cover short calls the next week? Maybe selling an ITM put to recapture the shares? (NOTE: I put calls on fewer than half of my shares at a time, so the calls I‚Äôm trying to cover are technically already covered, they just don‚Äôt fit in with the way I trade).  If the market crashes or TSLA drops 50% and I get margin called, I would be fine - my risk is managed. I‚Äôm just trying to figure out, if I wanted to churn my account, based on using covered calls, is there a smart way to do it?,;,; 2023-10-05 19:43:08]
[explain this options strstegy on tsly,;,; Let's start our own TSLY fund today. We will deal with the equivalent of 100 TSLA shares, or 1 option contract. We buy the Jan 19 2024 $270 call for $3800 and sell the Jan 19 2024 $270 put for $3380....net cost $420. We now sell the July 28 2023 $280 call for $150. So the yield for one week is 35.7%. The long call/short put has 26 weeks, and there will be lots of TSLA movement, but if the average short call premium stays at $150 per week, in 26 weeks you make $3,900 on a $450 investment. Let's assume TSLA stays below $270, so we also lose the $420. So net, we make $3,480 on the initial $420 investment. If I did my division correctly, that's over 800%. A similar buy/write utilizing 100 shares of TSLA stock yields a little less than 15%. For those of you who do not understand why the dividend is so high or think it is not sustainable look at that 800% for 26 weeks again. The only issue when you hold this ETF is the performance of TSLA stock.   this was take from yahoo finanace   So basically buy a long leap call but why sell a same strike put when you sell another weekly call hoping to expire worthless   the put since it would be in the money would risk being called anytime assuming today to january and then the put would be way more than the call,;,; 2023-09-03 23:52:25]

[A trade against your long term holding feels very weird.,;,; I live in Canada and we have Tax Free Savings Account (somewhat similar to a Roth IRA in the USA), frequent trading is prohibited on the TFSA so I can only buy and hold for long term.   I personally am a very strong believer in TSLA and don't think the bear arguments against TSLA are credible, so lets just say I am very overweight on my TSLA position.   There was a very high probability trade against TSLA a few days ago from the following factors:  1. TSLA kept reaching the support line on the daily (too much selling pressure) and each rebound failed to breach resistance(not enough buyers). 2. SPY was showing weakness on both the daily and hourly candles.  3. TSLA and SPY broke down on the support line at a statistically significant level.  My trading account is happy as always, but my TFSA is sad. This happens at least every 2 months, and I always feel very weird when doing these trades. Most of strategies are backtested and I always make sure my strategies have a quantitative reasoning behind it. I don't let my fundamental analysis get in the way of my trades.

I'd greatly appreciate your insights, especially if you could share examples that resonate with your personal trading experiences. While I respect the confidentiality of your specific strategies, any general guidance would be invaluable. I recognize that every trade is distinct, so feel free to share a broad range of experiences.  1. **Profit Expectations:** What percentage gain do you typically aim for when initiating an options contract? For instance, do you consider a 1.5% gain over 2-3 days in SPY worthwhile? Or do you focus on same-day trades with stocks like TSLA? 2. **Contract Duration:** How long do you typically hold onto your contracts? Do you tend to close them the same day, wait until they turn against you, or hold until expiration? Additionally, how do you mitigate significant losses on SL in options trading? 3. **Stock Preferences:** Which stocks have consistently delivered the results you aim for? Do you lean towards stocks with low volatility or those with high volatility? For example, while SPY might not exhibit substantial percentage changes, TSLA often sees daily swings of around 4%.  On a side note, given TSLA's frequent 4% daily fluctuations, I've been contemplating trading shares instead of options. However, my primary objective is to hone my trading strategies.

But so far I can‚Äôt seem to get a reliable account of what GS‚Äôn actually is. It seems like people refer to dynamically delta hedging as GS‚Äôn but that can‚Äôt be right. For example people describe GSing as:   ‚Ä¢ Buy 50 shares TSLA.  ‚Ä¢ Buy an ATM put (assuming it has 0.5d) ‚Ä¢ Rebalance each n periods by adjusting the shares held.   Surely this is just basic regular delta adjusting?.   Surely with GSing you‚Äôd want to readjust the delta each time via the option leg, to keep your option ATM for max gamma. I‚Äôd have thought that maybe GSing would include adding in an another option leg to adjust the micro delta / gamma values that can‚Äôt be done with an ATM call and 50 shares?,;,; 2023-11-19 14:10:21]

[Profit on put vertical spreads and closing them,;,; Hi Fam,  I have opened a small put vertical spread position to use as a learning tool. On 1/3/24, I sold a TSLA 2/16/24, $210 PUT and bought a 2/16/24, $205 PUT for a $90 credit, excluding fees.  So far the trade appears to be going as expected. The plan is to evaluate/close at around 21 day mark or 50% profit, whichever comes first, with goal being 50% profit.  When opening this position, I executed both, the STO and BTO, at the same time.  I am thinking ahead about the profit as well as how to close it.  The 2 questions in my mind are:  1 - How do I determine when I am at 50% profit? Am I looking at the price spread between the legs and once that drops to $45, I have reached 50% profit?  2 - When closing do I execute both, the BTC and STC, at the same time or leg out of each side separately? Pros vs cons for each method?  Anything that I have not considered is always welcome as I am here to learn.

[From CAPM To Hedging,;,; \[This post uses stats 101 but can be approached with little math knowledge because it moves slowly...it builds to a set of tools for determining your hedge ratios for paired trades and aggregating deltas across an entire portfolio if you want to hedge the systemic risk with a benchmark future like ES\]  &amp;#x200B;   Let‚Äôs start with a question from Twitter via  patrick\_oshag   *If you had to our your whole net worth into a single company right now (public or private), what would you pick?   Berkshire Hathaway is not allowed as an answer*      This is a provocative question. Patrick was clever to disallow Berkshire. In this post, we are going to use this question to launch into the basics of regression, correlation, beta hedging and risk.  Let‚Äôs begin.  ## My Reaction To The Questionüì∑  I don‚Äôt know anything about picking stocks. I do know about the nature of stocks which makes this question scary. Why?  1. Stocks don‚Äôt last foreverMany stocks go to zero. The distribution of many stocks is positively skewed which means there‚Äôs a small chance of them going to the moon and reasonable chance that they go belly-up. The price of a stock reflects its mathematical expectation. Since the downside is bounded by zero and the upside is infinite, for the expectation to balance the probability of the stock going down can be much higher than our flawed memories would guess. Stock indices automatically rebalance, shedding companies that lose relevance and value. So the idea that stocks up over time is really stock *indices* go up over a time, even though individual stocks have a nasty habit of going to zero. For more see [*Is There Actually An Equity Premium Puzzle?*](https://moontowermeta.com/is-there-actually-an-equity-premium-puzzle/). 2. Diversification is the only free lunchThe first point hinted at my concern with the question. I want to be diversified. Markets do not pay you for non-systematic risk. In other words, you do not get paid for risks that you can hedge. All but the most fundamental risks can be hedged with diversification. See [*Why You Don‚Äôt Get Paid For Diversifiable Risks*](https://moontowermeta.com/why-you-dont-get-paid-for-diversifiable-risks/). To understand how diversifiable risks get arbed out of the market ask yourself who the most efficient holder of a particular idiosyncratic risk is? If it‚Äôs not you, then you are being outbid by someone else, or you‚Äôre holding the risk at a price that doesn‚Äôt make sense given your portfolio choices. Read [*You Don‚Äôt See The Whole Picture*](https://moontowermeta.com/you-dont-see-the-whole-picture/) to see why.  My concerns reveal why Berkshire would be an obvious choice. Patrick ruled it out to make the question much harder. Berkshire is a giant conglomerate. Many would have chosen it because it‚Äôs run by masterful investors Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger. But I would have chosen it because it‚Äôs diversified. It is one of the closest companies I could find to an equity index. Many people look at the question and think about where their return is going to be highest. I have no edge in that game. Instead, I want to minimize my risk by diversifying and accepting the market‚Äôs compensation for accepting broad equity exposure.  In a sense, this question reminds me of an interview question I‚Äôve heard.  *You are gifted $1,000,000 dollars. You must put it all in play on a roulette wheel. What do you do?*  The roulette wheel has negative edge no matter what you do. Your betting strategy can only alter the distribution. You can be crazy and bet it all on one number. Your expectancy is negative but the payoff is positively skewed‚Ä¶you probably lose your money but have a tiny chance at becoming super-rich. You can try to play it safe by risking your money on most of the numbers, but that is still negative expectancy. The skew flips to negative. You probably win, but there‚Äôs a small chance of losing most of your gifted cash.  I would choose what‚Äôs known as a *minimax* strategy which seeks to minimize the maximum loss. I would spread my money evenly on all the numbers, accept a sure loss of 5.26%.[1](https://moontowermeta.com/from-capm-to-hedging/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5236) The minimax response to Patrick‚Äôs question is to find the stock that is the most internally diversified.  ## Berkshire Vs The Marketüì∑  I don‚Äôt have an answer to Patrick‚Äôs question. Feel free to explore the speculative responses in the thread. Instead, I want to dive further into my gut reaction that Berkshire would be a reasonable proxy to the market. If we look at the mean of its [annual returns](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2021ltr.pdf) from 1965 to 2001, the numbers are gaudy. Its CAGR was 26.6% vs the SP500 at 11%. Different era. Finding opportunities at the scale Buffet needs to move the needle has been much harder in the past 2 decades.¬†  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/zfqfg4c8zy8b1.png?width=253&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1b304927889c03d6e33536fd2480921543fec73  &amp;#x200B;     Buffet has been human for the past 20 years. This is a safer assumption than the hero stats he was putting up in the last half of the 20th century.¬†  The mean arithmetic returns and standard deviations validate my hunch that Berkshire‚Äôs size and diversification [2](https://moontowermeta.com/from-capm-to-hedging/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5236) make it behave like the whole market in a single stock.¬†  Let‚Äôs add a scatterplot with a regression.¬†  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ct6ujfx9zy8b1.png?width=675&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68d17d0dd8275d198ca3197bb624c98afe1a9a6b     f you tried to anticipate Berkshire‚Äôs return, your best guess might be its past 20 year return, distributed similarly to its prior volatility. Another approach would be to see this relationship to the SP500 and notice that a portion of its return can simply be explained by the market. It clearly has a positive correlation to the SP500. But just how much of the relationship is explained by SP500? This is a large question with practical applications. Specifically, it underpins how market netural traders think about hedges. If I hedge an exposure to Y with X how much risk do I have remaining? To answer this question we will go on a little learning journey:  1. Deriving sensitivities from regressions in general 2. Interpreting the regression 3. CAPM: Applying regression to compute the ‚Äúrisk remaining of a hedge‚Äù  On this journey you can expect to learn the difference between beta and correlation, build intuition for how regressions work, and see how market exposures are hedged.¬†  ## Unpacking The Berkshire Vs SP500 Regressionüì∑  A regression is simply a model of how an independent variable influences a dependant variable. Use a regression when you believe there is a causal relationship between 2 variables. Spurious correlations are correlations that will appear to be causal because they can be tight. The regression math may even suggest that‚Äôs the case. I‚Äôm sorry. Math is a just a tool. It requires judgement. The sheer number of measurable quanitites in the world guarantees an infinite list of correlations that serve as humor not insight[3](https://moontowermeta.com/from-capm-to-hedging/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5236).  The SP500 is steered by the corporate earnings of the largest public companies (and in the long-run the Main Street economy[4](https://moontowermeta.com/from-capm-to-hedging/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5236)) discounted by some risk-aware consensus. Berkshire is big and broad enough to inherit the same drivers. We accept that Berkshire‚Äôs returns are partly driven by the market and partly due to its own idiosyncracies.  Satisfied that some of Berkshire‚Äôs returns are attributable to the broader market, we can use regression to understand the relationship. In the figure above, I had Excel simply draw a line that best fit the scatterplot with SP500 being the independent variable, or X, and Berkshire returns being the dependant or Y. The best fit line (there are many kinds of regression but we are using a simple linear regression) is defined the same way in line is: by a slope and an intercept.¬†  The regression equation should remind you of the generic form of a line y = mx + b where m is the slope and b is the intercept.¬†  In a regression:  **y=Œ±+Œ≤x**  where:  y = dependant variable (Berkshire returns)  x = independent variable (SP500 returns)  Œ± = the intercept (a constant)  Œ≤ = the slope or sensitivity of the Y variable based on the X variable  If you right-click on a scatterplot in Excel you can choose ‚ÄúAdd Trendline‚Äù. It will open the below menu where you can set the fitted line to be linear and also check a box to ‚ÄúDisplay Equation on chart‚Äù.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/zqi7y5wbzy8b1.png?width=275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddceb144a7c583bcd5e7416c8124a90044cce499     This is how I found the slope and intercept for the Berkshire chart:  y = .6814x + .0307  Suppose the market returns 2%:  Predicted Berkshire return = .6814 \* 2% + 3.07%  Predicted Berkshire return = 4.43%  So based on actual data, we built a simple model of Berkshire‚Äôs returns as a function of the market.¬†  It‚Äôs worth slowing down to understand how this line is being created. Conceptually it is the line that minimizes the squared errors between itself and the actual data. Since each point has 2 coordinates, we are dealing with the variance of a joint distribution. We use covariance instead of variance but the concepts are analogous. With variance we square the deviations from a mean. For covariance, we multiply the distance of each X and Y in a coordinate from their respective means: **(x·µ¢ ‚Äì xÃÑ)(y·µ¢ -yÃÑ)**  Armed with that idea, we can compute the regression line by hand with the following formulas:  **Œ≤ or slope = covar(x,y)/ var(x)**  **Œ± or intercept = yÃÑ ‚Äì Œ≤ÃÑxÃÑ**  We will look at the full table of this computation later to verify Excel‚Äôs regression line. Before we do that, let‚Äôs make sure that this model is even helpful. One standard we could use to determine¬† if the model is useful is if it performs better than the cheapest naive model that says:  Our predicted Berkshire return simply is mean return from sample.  This green arrows in this picture represent the error between this simple model and the actual returns.¬†  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/as1p2cjdzy8b1.png?width=708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e2b9cb1add48164c95ff5e3e6df447c339148d5     This naive model of summing the squared differences from the mean of Berkshire‚Äôs returns is exactly the same as variance. You are computing squared differences from a mean. If you take square root of the average of the squared differences you get a standard deviation. In, this simple model where our prediction is simply the mean our volatility is 16.5% or the volatility of Berkshire‚Äôs returns for 20 years.¬†  In the regression context, the total variance of the dependent variable from its mean is knows as the **Total Sum of Squares** or **TSS**.¬†  The point of using regression though is we can make a better prediction of Berkshire‚Äôs returns if we know the SP500‚Äôs returns. So we can compare the mean to the fitted line instead of the actual returns. The sum of those squared differences is known as the **Regression Sum Of Squares** or **RSS**. This is the sum of squared deviations between the mean and fitted predictions instead of the actual returns. If there is tremendous overlap between the RSS and TSS, than we think much of the variance in X explains the variance of Y.  The last quantity we can look at is the **Error Sum of Squares** or **ESS**. These are the deviations from the actual data to the predicted values represented by our fitted line. This represents the unexplained portion of Y‚Äôs variance.¬†  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/1rffmi3fzy8b1.png?width=707&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30b052be4c4675c1ed2b15eb13c0048adb100960     Let‚Äôs use 2008‚Äôs giant negative return to show how TSS, RSS, and ESS relate.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/qa0wf9hgzy8b1.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f243231dd10421f7ead8914e2536309ea0520cd0     The visual shows:  **TSS = RSS + ESS**  We can compute the sum of these squared deviations simply from their definitions:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/l4qfntajzy8b1.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5330715f05b291ae494034c65e747e19c43e0359     The only other quantities we need are variances and covariances to compute Œ≤ or slope of the regression line.¬†  In the table below:  ≈∑ = the predicted value of Berkshire‚Äôs return aka ‚Äúy-hat‚Äù  xÃÑ = mean SP500 return aka ‚Äúx-bar‚Äù  yÃÑ = mean Berkshire return aka ‚Äúy-bar‚Äù  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/hg9cedokzy8b1.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17001f458cb11098cb00ee07cf923e9a98678aa0  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/99jjjwhlzy8b1.png?width=181&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df7449fe7c2caa4cd87ad3b14993a1864b441b5b     ¬† **Œ≤ = .40 / .59 = .6814**  ¬† **Œ± = yÃÑ ‚Äì Œ≤ÃÑxÃÑ = 10.6% ‚Äì .6814 \* 11.1% = 3.07%**  This yields the same regression equation Excel spit out:  **y=Œ±+Œ≤x**  **≈∑ = 3.07% + .6814x**  ## R-Squaredüì∑  We walked through this slowly as a learning exercise, but the payoff is appreciating the R¬≤. Excel computed it as 52%. But we did everything we need to compute it by hand. Go back to our different sum of squares.  TSS or variance of Y = .52  ESS or sum of squared difference between actual data and the model = .25  Re-arranging TSS = RSS + ESS we can see that RSS = .27  Which brings us to:  **R¬≤ = RSS/TSS = .27/.52 = 52%**¬†  Same as Excel!  R¬≤ is the regression sum of squares divided by the total variance of Y. It is called the *coefficient of determination* and can be interpreted as:  **The variability in Y explained by X**  So based on this small sample, 52% of Berkshire‚Äôs variance is explained by the market, as proxied by the SP500.¬†  ## Correlationüì∑  Correlation, r (or if you prefer Greek, œÅ) can be computed in at least 2 ways. It‚Äôs the square root of R¬≤.  **r = ‚àöR¬≤ = ‚àö.52 = .72**  We can confirm this by computing correlation by hand according to its own formula:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/30x0p5dozy8b1.png?width=177&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1aaf9777579657db3fddc98882675a225a8b195   Substituting:   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/nj1smpmpzy8b1.png?width=346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72c8a205d29e0c6fac9a4dd92fbd1e11e46afda1     Looking at the table above we have all the inputs:  **r = .40 / sqrt(.59 x .52)**  **r = .72**  Variance is an unintuitive number. By taking the square root of variance, we arrive at a standard deviation which we can actually use.  Similarly, covariance is an intermediate computation lacking intuition. By normalizing it (ie dividing it) by the standard deviations of X and Y we arrive at correlation, a measure that holds meaning to us. It is bounded by -1 and +1. If the correlation is .72 then we can make the following statement:  ***If x is 1 standard deviation above its mean, I expect y to be .72 standard deviations above its own mean.***  It is a normalized measure of how one variable co-varies versus the other.¬†  ## How Beta And Correlation Relateüì∑  Beta, Œ≤, is the slope of the regression equation.  Correlation is the square root of R2 or coefficient of determination.  Beta actually embeds correlation within it.  Look closely at the formulas:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/p856tajrzy8b1.png?width=181&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55323785b1d75418a81117bf950309636bc70167  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/wylxthkszy8b1.png?width=177&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34028ed71ea1d95233a7fcb4a02e020d603432b9     Watch what happens when we divide **Œ≤ÃÑ by r.**  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/knp9i20uzy8b1.png?width=288&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef35e10ac15500ee5ceae8e3213705d1653fcb07     Whoa.  ***Beta equals correlation times the ratio of the standard deviations.***¬†  The significance of that insight is about to become clear as we move from our general use of regression to the familiar CAPM regression. From the CAPM formula we can derive the basis of hedge ratios and more!  We have done all the heavy lifting at this point. The reward will be a set of simple, handy formulas that have served me throughout my trading career.  Let‚Äôs continue.  ## From Regression To CAPM¬†üì∑  The famous CAPM pricing equation is a simple linear regression stipulating that the return of an asset is a function of the risk free rate, a beta to the broader market, plus an error term that represents the security‚Äôs own idiosyncratic risk.¬†  **R·µ¢ = R’¢ + Œ≤(R‚Çò ‚Äì R’¢) + E·µ¢**  where:  R·µ¢ = security total return  R’¢ = risk-free rate  Œ≤ = sensitivity of security‚Äôs return to the overall market‚Äôs excess return (ie the return above the risk-free rate)  E·µ¢ = the security‚Äôs unique return (aka the error or noise term)  Since the risk-free rate is a constant, let‚Äôs scrap it to clean the equation up.     This is the variance equation for this security:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/p15vxy1yzy8b1.png?width=297&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7077da159beb29c4c4ceb4f97430c1b2d9dd18ed     Recall that beta is the vol ratio \* correlation:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/sqvzjrlzzy8b1.png?width=230&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3925e6c866d014667c5ea5fe2a2683940b634a3f     We can use this to factor the ‚Äúmarket variance‚Äù term.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ri8tf2610z8b1.png?width=347&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4109cbe01562c41c239e5dc15b37301f125fec89     Plugging this form of ‚Äúvariance due to the market‚Äù back into the variance equation:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/i2p7qsn20z8b1.png?width=361&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=860604ff025999eca2a708eabbe01010faafec7d     This reduces to the prized equation: The ‚Äúrisk remaining‚Äù formula which is the proportion of a stock‚Äôs volatility due to its own idiosyncratic risk.¬†  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/92tpep840z8b1.png?width=366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b171be3eb8e57a3fbaf2fb8571031d8e066a12d9     This makes sense. R2 is the amount of variance in a dependant variable attributable to indepedent variable. If we subtract that proportion from 1 we arrive at the ‚Äúunexplained‚Äù or idiosyncratic variance. By taking the square root of that quantity, we are left with unexplained volatility or ‚Äúrisk remaining‚Äù.¬†  Let‚Äôs use what we‚Äôve learned in a concrete example.  ## From CAPM To Hedge Ratiosüì∑  Let‚Äôs return to Berkshire vs the SP500. Suppose we are long $10mm worth of BRK.B and want to hedge our exposure by going short SP500 futures.¬†  We want to compute:  1. How many dollars worth of SP500 to get short 2. The ‚Äúrisk remaining‚Äù on the hedged portfolio  **How many dollars of SP500 do we need to short?**     Before we answer this lets consider a few ways we can hedge with SP500.¬†  * *Dollar weighting*   We could simply sell $10mm worth of SP500 futures which corresponds to our $10mm long in BRK.B. Since Berkshire and the SP500 are a similar volatility this is a reasonable approach. But suppose we were long TSLA instead of BRK.B. Assuming TSLA was sufficiently correlated to the market (say .70 like BRK.B), the SP500 hedge would be ‚Äútoo light‚Äù.¬†   Why?¬†   Because TSLA is about 3x more volatile than the SP500. If the SP500 fell 1 standard deviation, we expect TSLA to fall .70 standard deviations. Since TSLA‚Äôs standard deviations are much larger than the SP500 we would be tragically underhedged. Our TSLA long would lose much more money than our short SP500 position because we are not short enough dollars of SP500.¬†    * *Vol weighting*   Dollar weighting is clearly naive if there are large differences in volatility between our long and short. Let‚Äôs stick with the TSLA example. If TSLA is 3x as volatile as the SP500 then if we are long $10mm TSLA, we need to short $30mm worth of SP500.   Uh oh.¬†   That‚Äôs going to be too much. Remember the correlation. It‚Äôs only .70. The pure vol weighted hedge only makes sense if the correlations are 1. If the SP500 drops one standard deviation, we expect TSLA to drop only .70 standard deviations, not a full standard deviation. In this case, we will have made too much money on our hedge, but if the market would have rallied 1 standard deviation our oversized short would have been ‚Äúheavy‚Äù. We would lose more money than we gained on our TSLA long. Again, only partially hedged.¬†    * *Beta weighting*   Alas, we arrive at the goldilocks solution. We use the beta or slope of the linear regression to weight our hedge. Since beta equals correlation \* vol ratio we are incorporating both vol and correlation weighting into our hedge!¬†   I made up numbers vols and correlations to complete the summary tables below. The key is seeing how much the prescribed hedge ratios can vary depending on how you weight the trades.¬†       https://preview.redd.it/p8ujhzo60z8b1.png?width=537&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf5cf8298fa8153b1fce52979fb8a762d44418e8     * Beta weighting accounts for both relative volatilies and the correlation between names. Beta has a one-to-many relationship to its construction. A beta of .5 can come from:       * A .50 correlation but equal vols    * A .90 correlation but vol ratio of .56    * A .25 correlation but vol ratio of 2  It‚Äôs important to decompose betas because the correlation portion is what determines the ‚Äúrisk remaining‚Äù on a hedge. Let‚Äôs take a look.¬†  **How much risk remains on our hedges?**  We are long $10,000,000 of TSLA  We sell $21,000,000 of SP500 futures as a beta-weighted hedge.¬†  Risk remaining is the volatility of TSLA that is unexplained by the market.  * R2 is the amount of variance in the TSLA position explained by the market.¬† * 1-R2 is the amount of variance that remains unexplained * The vol remaining is sqrt(1-R2)  Risk (or vol) remaining = sqrt (1-.72) = 51%  TSLA annual volatility is 45% so the risk remaining is 51% \* 45% = 22.95%  22.95% of $10,0000 of TSLA = $2,295,000  So if you ran a hedged position, within 1 standard deviation, you still expect $2,295,000 worth of noise!  Remember correlation is symmetrical. The correlation of A to B is the same as the correlation of B to A (you can confirm this by looking at the formula).¬†  **Beta is not symmetrical because it‚Äôs correlation \* œÉdependant /** **œÉindependent**¬†  Yet risk remaining only depends on correlation.¬†  So what happens if we flipped the problem and tried to hedge $10,000,000 worth of SP500 with a short TSLA position.  1. First, this is conceptually a more dangerous idea. Even though the correlation is .70, we are less likely to believe that TSLA‚Äôs variance explains the SP500‚Äôs variance. Math without judgement will impale you on a spear of overconfidence.¬†    2. I‚Äôll work through the example just to be complete.¬†   To compute beta we flip the vol ratio from 3 to 1/3 then multiply by the correlation of .7   Beta of SP500 to TSLA is .333 \* .7 = .233   If we are long $10,000,000 of SP500, we sell $2,333,000 of TSLA. The risk remaining is still 51% but it is applied to the SP500 volatility of 15%.¬†   51% x 15% = 7.65% so we expect 7.65% of $10,000,000 or $765,000 of the SP500 position to be unexplained by TSLA.¬†    3. I‚Äôm re-emphasizing: math without judgement is a recipe for disaster. The formulas are tools, not substitutes for reasoning.¬†  **Changes in Correlation Have Non-Linear Effects On Your Risk**  Hedging is tricky. You can see that risk remaining explodes rapidly as correlation falls.  ***If correlation is as high as .86, you already have 50% risk remaining!***     In practice, a market maker may:  1. group exposures to the most related index (they might have NDX, SPX, and IWM buckets for example) 2. offset deltas between exposures as they accumulate 3. and hedge the remaining deltas with futures.¬†  You might create risk tolerances that stop you from say being long $50mm worth of SPX and short $50mm of NDX leaving you exposed the underlying factors which differentiate these indices. Even though they might be tightly correlated intraday, the correlation change over time and your risk-remaining can begin to swamp your edge.¬†     The point of hedging is to neutralize the risks you are not paid to take. But hedging is costly. Traders must always balance these trade-offs in the context of their capital, risk tolerances, and changing correlations.¬†  ## Reviewüì∑  I walked slowly through topics that are familiar to many investors and traders. I did this because the grout in these ideas often trigger an insight or newfound clarity of something we thought we understood.¬†  This is a recap of important ideas in this post:  * Variance is a measure of dispersion for a single distribution. Covariance is a measure of dispersion for a joint distribution. * Just as we take the square root of variance to normalize it to something useful (standard deviation, or in a finance context ‚Äî volatility), we normalize covariance into correlation. * Intuition for a positive(negative) correlation: if X is N standard deviations above its mean, Y is r \* N standard deviations above(below) its mean.¬† * Beta is r \* the vol ratio of Y to X. In a finance context, it allows it allows us to convert a correlation from a standard deviation comparison to a simple elasticity. If beta = 1.5, then if X is up 2%, I expect Y to be up 3% * Correlation is symmetrical. Beta is not.¬† * R2¬†is the variance explained by the independent variable. Risk remaining is the volatility that remains unexplained. It is equal to¬†sqrt(1-R2).¬† * There is a surprising amount of risk remaining even if correlations are strong. At a correlation of .86, there is 50% unexplained variance! * Don‚Äôt compute robotically. Reason &gt; formulas.¬†  Beware.  Least squares linear regression is only one method for fitting a line. It only works for linear relationships. Its application is fraught with pitfalls. It‚Äôs important to understand the assumptions in any models you use before they become load-bearing beams in your process.¬†,;,; 2023-06-29 14:54:29]
[Expected moves today, Powell, SPY, VIX,;,; Futures are lower for a 3rd straight day as the market waits for Fed Chair Powell's testimony in front of Congress. Some of his prepared remarks were released before the bell. The 3 day losing streak hasn't added up to much of a sell-off as of yet. The SPY is lower by about 1.5% since an intra-week high last Thursday. Nor has it affected vol much, the VIX is even lower than it was during that Thursday high in stocks.   As mentioned alot recently, yes vol is low, but the moves in the market are also very muted. The realized vol in SPY over the past month now sits at 12. Options in SPY are about 11 vol for the upcoming few weeks. In other words, IV is currently reflective of how the market is moving. Therefore option buyers are still having to get direction correct and be very nimble, despite how "cheap" vol is. Short-term option trading is basically a battle between implied vol, and realized vol. The mean reversion of IV (buying low IV, selling high IV) typically needs more time to play out. Speaking of that, when vol is this low for this long it's sometimes helpful to begin to look out a few months and see how low IV has been dragged down by what's happening recently. A look at SPY vol out in November and December shows at-the-money vol around 15-16. To put that in perspective, that's both below historical averages for IV, but it's also much lower than the realized vol if SPY over the past year, which is around 20, even with the slow grind of the past few months.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Action:**  * Tesla Inc (TSLA) +0.54% * Marathon Digital Hldgs Inc (MARA) +5.38% * Riot Platforms Inc (RIOT) +3.82% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +0.96% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.66% * Coinbase Global Inc Cl A (COIN) +2.89% * Opendoor Technologies Inc (OPEN) +4.23% * Alibaba Group Holding ADR (BABA) -0.65% * Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) +0.24% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.33% * Carvana Company Cl A (CVNA) +0.55% * Li Auto Inc ADR (LI) +3.14% * C3.Ai Inc Cl A (AI) -0.76%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * KB Home (KBH) Expected Move: 7.97% * Winnebago Industries, Inc.

[1 Yolo strategy for my birthday?,;,; Saturday was my birthday and I got $150 from various grandmas and I wanna do a single yolo play. I'm thinking of buying a call option with 1 year to expiration, possibly ITM or close to it. Reasons being that those contracts are usually more affordable, 1 year to expiration gives the stock time to move my direction, and I'm not rich enough to be purchasing contracts on bigger named tickers (spy tsla, amd, etc).  This would just be for fun, if it hits i'll buy a nice steak dinner. if not, it was birthday money.

[Swinging Options on Individual Tickers - Questions on Liquidity,;,; Hello,  I am a futures trader and now looking into also swing trading based on price action on daily and weekly candle closes of individual stocks; but I have a few questions before I start.  I'm unsure about the liquidity of options when looking to exit any swing. How do I know if I will run into an issue finding a buyer for my option?      For example, I want to purchase an ATM call on VFC, because I think the price action is trying to reverse. I think we are in for a major retracement upward. But I'm only looking to trade it, not to exercise the contract. Will it be easy for me to sell my option days or weeks later if the option is in the money? Or should I only look to trade options on very high liquid tickers like TSLA, SPY, SPX, FB, etc.  Thanks!  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-12-17 20:45:07]
[IV and HV relationship,;,; Hi,  I am trying to learn more about IV and HV percentile before making my trades. Can someone explain this better ? My understanding is that IV is future looking and HV is past looking.

[Expected moves, SPY QQQ Tesla, yields.,;,; Stock futures are again lower, continuing on a theme since last Thursday. This is the 4th straight day starting in the red. Central banks are the focus this week with Jerome Powel on Capitol Hill again today while earlier, the Bank of England announced a 50 basis point raise. You're probably used to hearing the word "stubborn" inflation by now but the "stubborn" part is clearly something central banks are still trying to figure out. With other central banks taking the lead (or catching up) even while the FOMC is "pausing" treasury yields remain bid. 1-year treasury yields are now the highest they've been during this cycle. However, the 2-year yield is still lower than the level it reached prior to the Silicon Valley Bank mess (that sent yields plummeting.) Yields bottomed around the first week of May. But stocks have managed to climb alongside yields, with the SPY up 8% while the 2-year yield has climbed a full point over the past month and a half. In other words, stocks have largely shrugged off the bond market recently and don't seem overly concerned with the FOMC picking up where it left off, or keeping rates higher for longer. So far.

[Hold or Roll?,;,; Strategy question.  I have several long calls \[AAPL, NVDA, TSLA\] that are now ITM, with 60-80 DTE.  I remain bullish on all three in the short term and my expectation is that they will continue to rise as expiration approaches.   On that assumption, how do I determine whether I'm better off holding, or rolling to a longer expiration/higher strike?  I realize that rolling locks in my profits, and that a longer expiration pushes the worst of theta decay into the future.  But is it really that simple?  Is there no scenario where I'm better off, e.g., sitting tight, waiting for my exit return percentage, and cashing out, as opposed to rolling up and out?  Again, assuming the underlying securities still have some room to rise in the near term.  Delta for these options range from .51 to .72, in case that's of interest.

[SPY PUTS AFTER THOUGHT,;,; Hey guys,  After learning from my mistake of going into TSLA 270P JUL 21 right before market close ($1 to $8), I went into SPY puts today to fulfill my destiny. I went for Aug18 avoiding weeklies and strike was 440. Was expecting more move today, so I had to close by end of day to lock in 22% gain.   I used volatility tools on interactive brokers to compare historical vol with implied vol. For this maturity, both were on the low-end (~10% annually),  so as earnings come in we might expect these numbers to increase. So it‚Äôs still an early play and can get back in for a better setup right? I‚Äôd target 440 again, but not sure if 30 days is a good setup.  I know some folks suggested optiontools to estimate the option values, just thinking how reliable are comparing implied vol vs historical vol, or any other tools that exist on brokers? I want to be become better at executing + finding the right option, would like to have feedback on how to use these option/volatility tools to perfect the art.

[Tesla options mispricing or am I overlooking something important,;,; Hey All,  I'm seeing this in the tesla options.  Tesla Stock Price: 252.08 as of 12/18/2023  JAN 2025 PUT OPTION with a 250 STRIKE is 43 dollars  JAN 2025 CALL OPTION with 290 STRIKE is 43 dollars  To keep it simple, lets say I buy a 100 shares of Tesla for 25K.  I could collar it by buying the 250 put and selling a covered call at 290 with net cost of zero.  My overall downside is zero. The stock could drop 50 percent and I could still sell it for 250 in JAN 2025. My upside would be limited to (290 - 250) = \~15 percent, but getting this upside with zero downside seems almost too good to be true. Am I missing something here?,;,; 2023-12-19 03:13:23]
[Cvna Greeks and IV are awol,;,; I use td Ameritrade and for some reason all the information about my cvna options is just gone.  It happened suddenly this past week.  I've patiently waited a few days and it isn't coming back.  I'm talking about basic stuff like iv, delta, theta for popular aug strikes on puts and calls -30, 40, 50, 60.  It isn't the first time.  Earlier this year I lost all the same info for tsla.  It eventually came back but it took weeks.  It's not like this stuff is hard to get, and there is plenty of liquidity - 100s or 1000s of contracts a day.  Why am I having this problem?  How is this acceptable? Do other traders not rely on these things?  Is cvna unique in some way?  My other tickers aren't affected.  I feel like I'm totally in the dark with cvna and it makes me want to close all my positions, despite my previous plans or profitably.  This really upsets me.  I use mobile and web.   The info is not shown on either.  Time to find a better broker platform???  Do others have this issue with td Ameritrade?  Is there regulation that they are breaking here by presenting traders with missing and incorrect data?,;,; 2023-07-30 16:32:13]
[Daily 0 DTE Long Straddles With /ES Futures Options. The quickest way to rags or riches?,;,; The idea: open (buy) a long straddle that is 0 DTE, every single day of the week.  BUT use /ES futures options instead of SPX, SPY, AAPL, TSLA, etc.  Example ‚Äì /ES is currently at 4000:  -	Buy an /ES futures option call @4000. 0 DTE. -	Buy an /ES futures option put @4000. 0 DTE.

[Expected moves this week. Tesla, Netflix, Schwab and more.,;,; The VIX closed 19.30 on Friday and was bid most of the day. It was higher the first two hours even while the market was up on the day, an unusual occurrence, especially on a Friday. Some of that can probably be attributed to worries about the Middle East into the weekend but out-of-the-money puts are certainly being bought as hedges, with vol below the 20 delta level now above 20IV in the next two months. Keep an eye on the VIX as it's been asleep for so long it wouldn't take much for people short vol to get caught offsides. (they also could be completely correct and the market slow grinds higher into year-end, but the point is the VIX is not "broken" and still tells a story when it gets above 20).  The expected move for this week in SPY is a bit more than 1.5%. QQQ is about 2%. 0DTE expected moves in SPY has been pretty consistently near the 0.7% range, and QQQ 0DTE expected moves have been closing in on 1% a day. That's alot more than over the Summer when SPY 0DTE expected moves were consistently below a half a percent a day.  The big story on the stock front this week is earnings, with the regional banks starting to report (as well as the rest of the big Wall Street banks, and then tech reports start to heat up, led by Netflix and Tesla this week.

[Barron's projections of earnings reports,;,; Hi all, I am a Barron's daily reader (since last year only) as many in this community (I assume). I use it for general financial trends and analysis. Recently I observed their projections are proving to be right ahead of earnings reports as below.  1) AMZN Q3 22: they predicted stock will drop and it dropped from \~110 to \~90.  2) TSLA Q4 22: predicted stock will beat estimates and it went from \~145 to \~175  3) UPST Q1 23 (2 days back): predicted stock will perform above estimates and it sky rocketed \~40% yesterday (though it is dropping today). I was brave enough and sold puts on UPST and they printed money.  What you guys experience with Barron's projections going into earnings. Do you take these cues to place contracts ? I just want to make sure am not just lucky but want to find the correlation. Thanks!,;,; 2023-05-11 18:17:13]
[Deep OTM Options as a Strategic Investment,;,; Having read a good chunk of Options as a Strategic Investment awhile back, I throughly it prudent to get around to doing the exact opposite and consider deep OTM options.   It‚Äôs lead to me serious perusement, do any investors here employ deep OTM options. People rant about them being long shots, gambles, the moonballs for clueless wsb plays, but I don‚Äôt understand the view of their lack of value.   Last week I felt quite uneasy of where the market was going this week, obviously it‚Äôs been dropping off but the idea of a correction rally seemed probable too, so I didn‚Äôt want to risk more expensive positions.  So as an experiment, I scrolled up and down the the options chain for this weeks expiration (last week) and looked at options around the 5-10 mark. More out of curiosity I bought a few calls and puts. $20 was my capital at risk, meh. I didn‚Äôt expect the options to become ITM, but I knew they would increase in value if the price approached the strikes in the first half of the week.   Today, I closed off my NVDA call (480 strike) and TSLA put for about 80 and 65. That‚Äôs a substantial return on investment. I understand a luckly bull/bear run doesn‚Äôt equate to a winning strategy, but I am curious if people employ deep OTMs as part of their trading/investment strategy.   Cheers all, good luck.,;,; 2023-08-15 16:40:41]

[Expected moves: SPY, QQQ, Tesla, fed minutes and more.,;,; Stock futures are lower this morning, a slight pullback following the past week's gains. The FOMC minutes (from the June meeting) highlight the economic calendar. The market is pricing a more than 80% chance of a rate hike at the upcoming (July 25-26) meeting. There are also expectations of another hike before year-end. These minutes are closely followed by a jobs number on Friday, and a CPI release next week so some clarity on future hikes may be realized in the next week. Meanwhile, option prices are likely to see a bit of a pop this morning, both out of the quasi long holiday weekend, but also with stock futures pointing lower. The VIX printed below 13 on Friday, its lowest level in years, but it is already higher this morning, around 14.50. Again, around 19 is the historical mean so anything in this current range is historically low. However, as has been mentioned in this space before, the realized, or actual volatility of the market is in fact even lower. The SPY realized vol for the past 30 days is 10. That compares to realized vol in SPY over the past year of 19. So the low IV has been justified and will remain until something either spooks the market lower or a FOMO situation develops to the upside. SPY weekly at the money IV is about 10 (as of Friday's close) but should tick up a little bit on the down open and with FOMC minutes and NFP jobs number on Friday.   The earnings calendar remains light today but does begin to pick up after next week, when we're smack dab in earnings season again.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Movers:**   Some notable stocks making moves this morning.     * **Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +6.29%** * **Tesla Inc (TSLA) -0.79%** * **Marathon Digital Hldgs Inc (MARA) -3.13%** * **Riot Platforms Inc (RIOT) -3.75%** * **Xpeng Inc ADR (XPEV) -1.93%** * **Coinbase Global Inc Cl A (COIN) -2.84%** * **Astrazeneca Plc ADR (AZN) +2.57%** * **Wolfspeed Inc (WOLF) +18.06%** * **Mp Materials Corp (MP) +9.24%** * **Transocean Inc (RIG) +4.30%** * **Advanced Health Intelligence Ltd ADR (AHI) -8.77%** * **Hut 8 Mining Corp (HUT) -1.42%**  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**   none     Full list here: [Options AI Earnings Calendar](http://url5578.options.ai/ls/click?upn=WHju0C1BRPoBuTdL0xEcqZNWu421ak771SLA5jzpsv-2BU8w7tMzcR-2B7I-2FswbV9O3IjjJgP1PQKL9ll-2BR2phXTZw-3D-3Dg_w-_yIbKbwLGaUiHkJ2rj-2FVSLO9FkCqgwrqJUZFsR-2FM-2BW6g1NUq5hkNfzxZGFziJBIqnJxtsA-2B6Nrh8CHL3OufU5QY5TkfelaO1-2BVX2-2BiE-2FOZYaESMPanMchodgzcuMV0SgXO0AWKQd0mPpCRbCJDvN9WyFaHeFa6ySpBNBW7kreckhGxf55VjVHwQpiTeiiIfN1u3OTX-2FsJMZERz24RxbyvgDUrkLxOEN4r7l24q6GYqBSB18npoE5CJUKakp9HVfJOTWKOd28Dst9mVWdVW8ps2md2cMgJ-2FAV4iqi2rCRuaO4B7EVHHUBrDO8MX3G-2BOfRSXZXXmBWysU2QTt1RIFs18g-3D-3D)  &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar:**     * **At 10:00 AM (EST) Factory Orders MoM (May) Estimates: 0.8%, Prior: 0.4%** * **At 02:00 PM (EST) FOMC Minutes Impact: High** * **At 04:00 PM (EST) Fed Williams Speech Impact: Medium**  &amp;#x200B;  **Scanner Highlights:**   Based on the prior day's trading action.     * **Overbought (RSI):** DAL (87), LUV (83), AAL (82), JBLU (80), JETS (80), HUT (80) * **Oversold (RSI):** AZN (24), PFE (38), MU (43), MRNA (43), PENN (44), SBUX (44) * **High IV:** NKLA (+257%), RAD (+242%), LUMN (+156%), LCID (+109%), HOOD (+106%), PENN (+102%), PFE (+101%), GE (+101%), SPOT (+101%) * **Unusual Options Volume:** HOOD (+632%), CGC (+610%), RIOT (+589%), AZN (+552%), JPM (+540%), MSTR (+513%), CSCO (+500%), COIN (+461%), XPEV (+460%)  Full lists here: [Options AI Free Tools](http://url5578.options.ai/ls/click?upn=WHju0C1BRPoBuTdL0xEcqZNWu421ak771SLA5jzpsv8cedLq-2BOIzmLf53JNdlOJz0sws_yIbKbwLGaUiHkJ2rj-2FVSLO9FkCqgwrqJUZFsR-2FM-2BW6g1NUq5hkNfzxZGFziJBIqnJxtsA-2B6Nrh8CHL3OufU5QY5TkfelaO1-2BVX2-2BiE-2FOZYaESMPanMchodgzcuMV0SgXO0AWKQd0mPpCRbCJDvN9WyFaHeFa6ySpBNBW7kreckhGxf55VjVHwQpiTeiiIfN1VyDKjijw1BPB7CTozLtaRyQKXemk06YCuISpLhX25XqEyeLrvfxxSnBsRssdNgeH-2FsYXq6BQHx8Fsrv-2BzAJuifwV12lW6n25Qe-2F5YWNtC6cp3F-2FPuhYEL1-2FeI9gLsPUTgk1YohUzGqbRva7DwoiDbA-3D-3D).  &amp;#x200B;  **Chart of the Day:**  Tesla stock is up 18% in July (one trading day).

[Help understanding the risk of early assignment.,;,; I am looking at a possible trade. TSLA put credit spread. But it would be deep in the money.   Buy 25 contracts of Jan 21 24 450p. ($200) Sell 25 contracts of Jan 21 24 483.33p. ($230)   Credit of $75,000.  Max risk $8,325.  Now I'm just learning so be gentle.   First is I get the credit immediately, right?   Second, that risk means if it's below 450 on Jan 21, I will owe the difference between the two strikes of 33.33, times 100 shares, times the 25 contracts. $83,325? The one I sold will get assigned, so I will have to buy shares at 483.33, but I can sell shares at 450 because of my bought put. Right?   If it's between the two strikes, I can sell the shares at the current price, lets say 465, so I lose the difference between 465 and 483.33, or 18.33 times 2500 = $45,825, but this comes out of my original credit of $75,000, so I still profit nearly 30k?   Above 483.33 doesn't matter to me as both contracts will expire worthless and I just keep the original 75k?  Now with all that being said, what is the likelihood of getting assigned early on this trade? If that happens say in 2 months and the price is at 350, does that guarantee max risk instantly? Would I need enough to cover that amount of shares in my account (2500 x 483.33 or 1.2 million) before I could even pull off this trade?   Thanks in advance for reading all this. Not sure where to start with help like this.,;,; 2023-08-08 04:39:04]

[Unique Tool for Finding Options,;,; I recently built a free tool for finding options. [https://options-alpha-finder.com/](https://options-alpha-finder.com/)  I'd like to see if people in this community can get value from it and maybe help provide feedback on the tool. There are really 2 different tools inside;  First Tool: "Compare Options"  Choose a stock (e.g. TSLA), an expiry (e.g. 17/01/2025), and an estimated future stock price (e.g. 420) and compare all option returns visually (blue line).  https://preview.redd.it/ufhvf60xgwhb1.png?width=1083&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c90dd871aa4dbbaf973ab68427920eb98c3e5696  Second Tool: " Portfolio Analysis";  There are many use cases to this tool. You can input a list of option positions and stock long/short positions and value your portfolio at any point in the future (given your expectations about the underlying stock prices min/expected/max).  If you want to focus on just one underlying stock, this allows you to visualise classic option strategies as you get close to expiry like the "bull call spread" below.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/589tysbffwhb1.png?width=1114&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9b2bb681012e0e2558305bf9800667ce89ee92c  It would genuinely mean a lot to get any feedback, thanks!  Feel free to add questions or suggestions in the comments or forward to the email on the site.  Note that it can work on mobile but is much better suited to desktop;  [https://options-alpha-finder.com/](https://options-alpha-finder.com/)  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-08-13 16:03:53]
[Looking for your favorite high volatility stocks for options trading,;,; Ive had a pretty good run this year trading the wheel strategy on AMD and COIN (covered calls, Cash secured puts).

[Gains from Anomaly Detection as a Swing Trader,;,;   I just vehemently disagree with day trading.   I do not think it works well when you consider the time investment and the competition.   Once I made the switch to anomaly detection with heavy focus on non-standard data points - I finally started making real money.  The biggest difference is my patience. I use to try and force the market to give my profits each week. Now I stay patient, listen and observe all the data.   I‚Äôve blown my account up 5 times, which helped me refine my strategy again and again.   I still have losses but when I win, I win big.  Patience is key.   Don‚Äôt fall for all these brokers and data points which are the same recycled garbage. It‚Äôs a waste of your time. Think about it - every brokers trading platform is a consolation prize. They make money on PFO, they don‚Äôt make money from your analysis, so they don‚Äôt prioritize their platforms and data.

[Buying Options Smarter,;,; Tl;Dr: buying OTM near DTE options generally is a losing approach to buying options. I prefer to buy options that: are at least 60DTE, typically 90+ &amp; deep ITM (&gt;0.80 delta). This is a more expensive approach that sacrifices compounding potential, however we greatly reduce our theta decay &amp; price sensitivity to smaller price movements.   The goal of this post is to encourage newer traders to more carefully consider their approach to buying options, specifically for a directional hypothesis. For many, they'll prefer further OTM &amp; nearer DTE options because they're cheaper. However, more often than not, this will lead to losing the investment. The primary situation I'd buy options is when trading a Ratio Diagonal (call for bullish thesis, put for bearish). I will focus on the long-option aspect of this strategy.  Let's take a look at the chart below for an idea of the pros and cons of each. I will use TSLA (at $234) for the example:  |Option|Cost|Theta &amp; Gamma|Value @ 5% move|Value at 10% move| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Long 8Dec 220P (0.26 delta) for 4.50 |$450/lot (100% extrinsic)|\-Theta: -.20        \-Gamma: 0.01|\+5%:          \-$239 today (-53% ROIC)      \-$450 at expiry               \-5%               +$408 today (91% ROIC)      \-$450 at expiry  |\+10%:          \-$357 today       \-$450 at expiry               \-10%               +$1,017 today       \+$503 at expiry | |Long 16Feb 290P (0.81 delta) for 60.50|$6,050/lot (7% extrinsic value)|\-Theta: -.06           \-Gamma: 0.01|\+5%:          \-$1,084 today (-18% ROIC)      \-$1,704 at expiry               \-5%               +$863 today (14% ROIC)      \+$777 at expiry |\+10%:          \-$1,832 today       \-$2,228 at expiry               \-10%               +$1,906 today       \+$1,885 at expiry | ||Deep ITM, Far Expiration = 13x more expensive, however, the majority is intrinsic value - which does not decay out.|Theta decays 3x faster for the OTM variant|Far OTM variant will have lower gross returns (+/-) but much higher ROIC (+/-)||  **Takeaways.**  * OTM options are cheaper and decay faster. They compound more quickly and have a lower gross $ gain (and loss) * Deep ITM options are more expensive and decay more slowly. They don't compound as quickly and have a higher gross $ return (and loss) * I tend to trade Deep ITM &gt; 90DTE for most of my directional plays, and based on my conviction, I might add some OTM options as "kickers" that are lower risk but will need a large move to show a strong return.   As always, if there are any questions, I'm happy to help however I can. ,;,; 2023-11-18 02:37:38]
[Tesla options,;,; Has anyone noticed the cheap prices on NTM calls and puts on feb 9 contracts?,;,; 2024-02-02 10:39:36]
[Best way to hedge against a large single stock position?,;,; I used to work for a big tech company, and have a large portion of my portfolio in this one stock.  I currently take the dividends I receive and use it to buy index funds (primary VTI, SCHD).  But, I want a better way to hedge against a drop.  I have a line of credit against the position, but it's pretty low compared to the total value, so don't have to worry about being margin called.  So far...I've bought cheap wayyy OTM puts, as a way to protect, but generally lose money on the put.  I realize that is to be expected since I'm trying to protect against tail risk.  I also did covered calls once, but ended up unwinding the position because I got ITM and the capital gains hit would've been too high.  Are there strategies I should be employed to protect my position against a drop and give me some cash to use to put back into the market?  The few times I've done OTM puts, I just pick a strike that I think could happen based on the recent lows of the stock.  But I'm sure there is a better way using greeks to pick the strike and date.    TIA,;,; 2023-05-03 17:33:52]

[Market Outlook: Bounce about to reverse?,;,; I've been holding cash for a while now, and I'm starting to get the feeling that this bounce is nearing its end. The economic headwinds seem very strong, and to me the path to soft landing seems to be narrowing. The media bought into the Fed crushing inflation with the last few CPI reports, but it's clear that this was mostly attributable to energy and food prices dropping. Core CPI is getting sticky and will only continue to be more of a nuisance as we drop into 5 and 4 percent territory. At the same time, people are feeling the effects of the tightening with credit card debt skyrocketing.  I plan to go short at some point in the next six months or even sooner if reports come out bad. I was just wondering if anyone who invested through dot com or 2008 is seeing parallels with our current economy. I feel like the perfect window to short tech is coming since the market ran up so hard on inflation news and AI speculation. I'm planning to buy long OTM puts expiring later in the year. Note I am limited by the premiums that I can afford which is less than $1000.  I was looking at the 9/15 $120 put on TSLA and the 9/15 $145 put on NVDA. Sound like a plan or no?,;,; 2023-02-20 21:56:39]
[Expected Moves this week, SPY, VIX, QQQ, MU and more.,;,; SPY was lower last week by about 0.6%, again, inside what options were pricing. Implied vol closed extremely low into the weekend, with SPY some at-the-money SPY weekly options sporting single-digit handles. That IV should reset a bit higher out of the weekend but overall vol remains historically below average and at multi-year lows. The VIX closed last week below 13.50. Of course, vol could always go lower, but it's getting to the point where those lower moves would be quite small. In general the 12-13 range in the VIX floor over the past 5 years and only on rare occasions over longer time horizons do you see it closer to 10. That's not to say it can't remain this low for a long time, but it can't get much lower. One thing to note from the past 2 weeks, the daily realized moves of the market versus what 0DTE options had been pricing has started to tip a bit in the favor of the market moves over the expected moves, particularly in the QQQ. That kind of action tends to put a floor on IV as well as option trading in same-day expiry is heavy volume and being more or less re-priced each day based on the prior day's result. Futures are flat to lower to start off the week.  This past weekend included some political chaos in Russia but markets this week will most likely concentrate on a combo of economic data like GDP &amp; Durable Goods and speeches by Lagarde (tues) and Powell (wed, thurs). SPY options are pricing about a 1.1% move for the week at 10 vol (at the money) although that could get a lift on the open.

[Stocks for Selling Puts,;,; Hey guys I'm pretty well versed on selling cash secured puts, and covered calls. I just wanted to see if anyone else has any stock recommendeds outside the ones I usually do on a weekly basis. (AMD, NIO,MARA, RIOT, AMC, PLTR). I have a stock screener I made myself with different filters but after I search a few new ones the premiums are never as good as the ones I usually do,;,; 2023-08-12 18:02:08]
[Infinite Passive Income on PMCC?,;,; All values here are drawn from the brokerage I personally use.  Lets say hypothetically after a few years of hard work, I accumulate a sum of 100 000 USD and decide to trade Poor Man's Covered Calls with it.  Current date of the hypothetical: Sep 11, 23.  For instance, AAPL stocks @ 178.180  Buy Feb 16, 24 159DTE 170.00C (Delta - 0.6912, Theta -0.0489) @ 18.70  Sell Oct 13, 23 33DTE 185.00C (Delta - 0.03149, Theta -0.0682)  @ 2.24  Net Debit = 16.46  Following the general guideline of 3-12month Deep ITM Call and 30-45days OTM Call with 70-80 Delta and 20-30Delta respectively.  Lets say for simplicity sake, I invest the 100 000USD into AAPL, buying and selling (100 000/1646 = 60.753(3d.p.) ) 60 ITM and OTM calls respectively.  When I sell calls every month once the written calls expire, would I not make 13440 USD (224\*60) per month on premium? Assuming that AAPL stocks do not crash out of nowhere and my Deep ITM returns breakeven. Of course this would be mitigated by spreading out the portfolio on many different stable companies working in different sectors to diversify the portfolio. After wrapping my head around this for a few hours I can't seem to find anything wrong with this line of thought, it however seems too good to be true. What is the risk or danger that I am missing out on? I understand that there is a risk of losing everything if the stock market crashes but as long as the portfolio is managed wisely wouldn't anyone who managed to accumulate 6 figures be able to retire with this plan?  &amp;#x200B;  Follow on question:  When considering choices for selling calls, why is 30-45 day call options recommended, I believe reading somewhere that time decay on option premium is exponential as time to expiry is nearer wouldn't shorting 1 week/2week call options be more profitable?  e.g.  Sell Sep 15, 23 5DTE 185.00C (Delta - 0.1391, Theta - -0.1212) @ 0.41  Sell Oct 13, 23 33DTE 185.00C (Delta - 0.3149, Theta - -0.0682)  @ 2.24  Taking a 5DTE vs 33DTE to compare, the Sep 15 call option makes 0.41 in 5 days which is 0.082 per day while the Oct 13 call option makes 2.24 in 33 days which is 0.0679 (3sf) per day. With this in mind isn't it wiser to sell call options every week leading to more profits? The theta seems to suggest that too, since Theta of Sep 15 call option &gt; Oct 13 call option. Does that mean that we make more money as time goes by?  &amp;#x200B;  EDIT: It appears some of you guys might have slightly misunderstood what I meant in my hypothetical, I do not intend on solely investing on one stock as I mentioned and I quote "Of course this would be mitigated by spreading out the portfolio on many different stable companies working in different sectors to diversify the portfolio." the idea of investing all in AAPL is for the sake of a simpler narrative. Instead by diversifying the 100 000K into stocks in many different sectors, tech, healthcare, energy etc. would this not be feasible?,;,; 2023-09-10 17:40:22]

[Questions on Exercise,;,; Starting on options, and have couple of questions.  1. When does options get exercise? Mainly selling covered options for Magninficant 7. Say, I sold a put options at 100USD with expiration date 10 days from now. Currently stock is trading 105USD. Let say on day 3, the stock dropped to 99USD. Would that get exercised immediately?  2. If the stock at expiration date is above 100USD, would it still get exercised, since it was below the strike price "sometime during the past 10 days".   3. If I bought an option, can I initiate a manual exercise, or would the be auto done by the brokerage? I'm using Interactive Brokers.   Thanks.,;,; 2024-02-06 00:02:32]

[sell underwater covered call options?,;,; I have several hundred stock in a company, and thought I'd sell 2 call options on it as I expected the price would stay flat or drop. As luck would have it the price of the stock has spiked, and has a call date of 1/19/24.   I wanted to check with you experts on my options. It seems I can either:   1) Let the option expire 1/19. I still make $ because the strike price is higher than my cost basis, but lose out on the increase in the stock price since then (\~30% higher). Also, I will have to pay long-term capital gains tax on this when it's called.   2) Buy my call option back, perhaps closer to 1/19. Take the \~40% hit, assuming the price will not fall. Take a tax loss.   3) Some other option?   Is there anything else I should consider or is this about it? I'm inclined to go with (1), as I think the stock is highly overpriced right now. ,;,; 2023-12-23 01:20:48]

[You guys ever have a position where the underlying slowly grinds against you? Just painful,;,; Got July 21 100 puts last Wednesday on Oracle. Think it was around 105.17.  Honestly I'm not too upside down on the position, since it's barely up 1.6%. Multiple reasons...but short term technical I thought I saw a double top with a topping tail on the Friday close of May 26th. Thought it was ripe for a downturn. Just painful watching it chop, until yesterday where it finally made a 1% move that really took a hit on. Had a chance this morning to cut losses at 20% during that pullback but of course I held on.  I thought their earnings was June 20th, but they just announced it was for the 12th. Debating on cutting now even if I got time on my puts, since I hate holding through earnings. Oracle isn't exactly a huge mover during earnings, but even a 5% pump can kill me. On the other hand, I still have FOMC and I'm betting on a hawkish and angry J-Pow. ,;,; 2023-06-06 17:32:24]

Whether that gets resolved with a VIX spike closer to 30 soon or not remains to be seen but traders should be watching that for any sort or capitulation indication of at least this recent selling causing a little panic selling of stocks. 0DTE and weekly IV is certainly higher now with daily expected moves now regularly over 1%. (compare that to 0.5% over the Summer).  This week has the potential for some resolution on some of these questions as we get to hear from the FOMC / Powell on Wednesday and the Payrolls number on Friday as well as another jam packed earnings week highlighted by names like AMD and Apple.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/oqdfp2a5f7xb1.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf20b64962c4d2a60e8662d635ba25f0ceb76a94  **SPY**  * Weekly Expected Move: **2%** * Weekly Range (roughly) **$402.50 - $419** * 0DTE/Daily Expected move:  **0.9%**  **QQQ**  * Weekly Expected Move: **2.5%** * Weekly Range (roughly): **$337-$354** * 0DTE/Daily Expected Moves: **1.2%**  &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar**  * Wednesday - ADP Employment, ISM Maufacturing, FOMC Rate Decision, FOMC Press Conference * Friday - NFP Payrolls, ISM Services  &amp;#x200B;  **Earnings of Note**  **Monday**  * **MCD** McDonald's Corporation **3.1%** * **AMGN** Amgen Inc. **3.4%** * **ANET** Arista Networks, Inc. **8.2%** * **ON** ON Semiconductor Corporation **7.1%**  **Tuesday**  * **PFE** Pfizer Inc .**3.9%** * **AMD** Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.**7.0%** * **BUD** Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV **3.7%** * **MPC** Marathon Petroleum Corporation **4.0%** * **SIRI** Sirius XM Holdings Inc. **10.0%** * **FSLR** First Solar, Inc. **8.6%** * **PAYC** Paycom Software, Inc. **10.4%**  **Wednesday**  * **NVO** Novo Nordisk A/S **4.6%** * **ABNB** Airbnb, Inc. **8.1%** * **HUM** Humana Inc. **3.8%** * **PYPL** PayPal Holdings, Inc. **8.7%** * **MNST** Monster Beverage Corporation **5.6%** * **ET** Energy Transfer LP **2.8%** * **MCHP** Microchip Technology Incorporated **8.3%** * **YUM** Yum!

[Expected moves today, GDP, Powell, Nike, SPY and QQQ,;,; Futures are higher this morning, with the market trying to end the quarter/first half of the year on a high note. SPY is up about 0.75% on the week as of yesterday's close. On the year the SPY is up about 14%, with the QQQ up an impressive 37%. Today, Jay Powell again speaks in Europe. On the economic front, we get the GDP number with the important PCE inflation data on Friday giving us a sense of the mood of the Fed, as well as growth and preferred inflation data they're trying to navigate. Vol remains low, with very few expectations of large market swings anytime in the near future. The VIX futures term structure remains steep, but December is now 19.5, very near the VIX's historical mean. In other words, vol is inexpensive near term, with the market's actual day-to-day vol muted, but longer-term options are also getting to some of the lowest levels we've seen in the past few years. After the bell we get results from Nike. Options are pricing about a 5.5% move.   **Expected move today (0DTE)**   SPY: 0.5%   QQQ: 0.7%  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Movers:**  * Joby Aviation Inc (JOBY) +8.71% * Eco Wave Power Global Ab ADR (WAVE) +75.62% * Tesla Inc (TSLA) +1.73% * Blackberry Ltd (BB) +14.97% * Jd.com Inc ADR (JD) -2.59% * Alibaba Group Holding ADR (BABA) -1.00% * Cormedix Inc (CRMD) -20.71%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * NIKE, Inc.

[I have a problem and would like to know good thinking strategies that you‚Äôve used to break the habit,;,; I have no idea how common this is but I‚Äôm assuming fairly, I buy and sell call and puts, have had good times and bad. My biggest problem that has persisted throughout my losses has been my inability to sell. I will be up 50-500% but with the options I look for I usually have about a 5-10 minute window to secure my profits. In those short moments watching the bid and ask rise I either put in a sell order that‚Äôs greedy af or I sit in the euphoria of having an unrealized gain. I have been able to break this and secure profits my win loss is about getting into the 40% (which is a massive improvement over losing 95% of my trades a year ago) if I were to be able to have slightly better price targeting I could start seeing some fairly decent gains.   What are some tools that you have used or rules you have set and how have you maintained the integrity of those rules?  Im not asking people who come on here and pretend to trade im asking the people who are in that shit everyday scraping those contracts.,;,; 2023-07-14 17:14:46]

[Expected moves: SPY, QQQ, 0DTE, American Express, Intuitive Surgical and more.,;,; With the futures slightly higher this morning SPY is unchanged on the week and up about 1% in October. It doesn't feel like it, right? The intraday swings have been swift and it hasn't been uncommon for the morning to look completely different from the afternoon. In fact, on Tuesday, the SPY hit the 0DTE expected move in both directions before ending up exactly unched. Sometimes it's helpful to get your bearings during two-way movement in the market. For instance, here's the SPY expected move chart for the next month or so. There's not a ton of panic yet in stocks and the expected move over the next month is just 3.5% or so:  https://preview.redd.it/kgjk5n92s5vb1.png?width=1253&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96063cbdb074490b43c0021c92484a6a19e610d6  If we were to see real panic of an acceleration of selling set in look for that expected move to get closer to 5%. The big macro news of the day is Fed Chair Powell will speak at noon (eastern) at the Economic Club of New York which will possibly be market moving. 0DTe expected moves have been higher recently, with QQQ often around 1%. Here's today's:  &amp;#x200B;  **0DTE Expected Move**  * SPY 0.7% (roughly $427-434) * QQQ 1.0% (roughly  $360-$367)  **Earnings After the Close:**  * Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

[Expected moves, Tesla, Netflix, Intuitive Surgical, Capital One and more.,;,; * Futures lower.  * QQQ -0.70%, SPY -0.25%  * Tesla and Netflix are both lower, but both within the expected move (thus far)  One of the things to look for as earnings season heats up is whether companies that miss see buyers below. We're about to get a test of underlying strength in the market with both Netflix and Tesla are lower on earnings. The two companies were the first mega-cap tech stocks to report this cycle. And most mega-cap stocks rallied into earnings season. If these companies miss, and find buyers below, the stocks will stay above their expected move levels, indicating an underlying bid in these stocks, folks that may have missed some of this rally, and now see a chance to get in. Obviously support levels are interesting spots to watch, but the options market provides another consistent one, the expected move. If the stocks continue lower, and close the day below their expected move (into earnings) it may indicate some buyer exhaustion, with buyers unwilling to step in or defend levels that were expected on a miss.  &amp;#x200B;  **Chart of the Day:**  Often, expected moves line up with recent resistance and support.

[Advice on my trading strategy,;,; Hello all.  I am looking to build a short term neutral portfolio that would edge long term bullish in some cases.  I am trying to hash out a definite strategy and trading plan that I can stick with to see consistent growth over time.  Currently I am looking at trading a 25k account. My current plan is as follows:  Utilize 30% ($7500) spread across 5-8 trades at approximately 45 DTE. Among these I would look to set up strangles and iron condors on certain ETFs/Equities.  I was considering using an ETF and it‚Äôs inverse with these positions for a truly ‚Äúneutral‚Äù position. Has anyone experimented with this? or a 3x fund it‚Äôs respective inverse.   On more volatile stocks such as TSLA I was considering selling debit put spreads or iron condors with premium collection around 1:3 the width of my spread.  I would look to take money off the table at 30-50% max profit. If I was to reach 40% I may would set a stop loss for 30-35% max profit and see if I could approach the 50% mark.  I would look to plan these trades at 45 DTE and hope to manage by 21 DTE.  Some of these rules are derived from Tastytrade recommendations.  My goal would be to have approximately 8 trades on at any given time with a total risk of 7500.  I am considering a stop loss of 20-50% to effectively only be risking $1500-$3750 in a max loss situation at any given time.  For those who are experienced and consistent with profitability can you evaluate this strategy and give recommendations on the strategy and/or tickers for trading?  I have been trading options for around 2 years and at one time made very nice profits. I scaled too fast, too soon and ultimately risked too much and gambled profits. I didn‚Äôt re-evaluate or restructure my trading habits and took a few more losses. Nothing that blew my account, but substantial enough to take extended time away from trading and margin.  I am now looking to get back into disciplined trading and would greatly appreciate honest and constructive feedback.  Thanks!   TLDR: Utilizing 30% of a 25k account at all times. ($7500) Looking for 5-8+ trades open at a time spread across different sectors and ETFs and it‚Äôs inverse Looking for 1:3 width of strike premium collection with a 50% profit target.

[Expected Moves this Week: FOMC, Autozone, FedEx and more,;,; This week is fairly quiet on the earnings front apart from Autozone and FedEx. On the economic news front a slew of interest rate decisions and global CPI and PMI reports. The FOMC announces Wednesday. The market is all but certain (99%) the Fed stays put this month but the focus will be on any hawkish language in the statement. SPY options are pricing about a 1.1% move for the week at about 14 IV. That IV drops the next week to 12, so options markets are trying to price a bit of volatility for this week, however, it's from a very low level of overall option prices. On that front, the VIX is now about 15, but got under 13 last week (pre-pandemic levels).  IV is historically low across the board but this past Friday's expiration saw a significant amount of option premium expire. Traders will be keeping an eye on whether there was a shift in the vol regime following that expiry. It is possible that the gamma in the market into this past Friday's expiry had a dampening effect on moves. Whether traders become option buyers or remain rolling sellers is yet to be seen. Keep an eye on both 0DTE/Weekly IV as well as the VIX to get a sense of which way that bias is trending.  &amp;#x200B;  **Expected Moves This Week:**  * SPY: 1.1% * QQQ: 1.6% * IWM: 1.5%  &amp;#x200B;  **Earnings of Note**  Monday  * **SFIX** Stitch Fix, Inc. **16.4%**  Tuesday  * **AZO** Autozone **5.3%** * **APOG** Apogee Enterprises, Inc. **8.8%**  Wednesday  * **FDX** FedEx Corporation **4.6%** * **GIS** General Mills, Inc. **4.8%** * **KBH** KB Home **6.2%**  Thursday  * **FDS** FactSet Research Systems Inc. **5.1%** * **DRI** Darden Restaurantsts **5.1%**  &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar**  * Tuesday: Canada CPI * Wednesday: UK CPI, FOMC Rate Decision * Thursday: Japan Rate Decision * Friday: S&amp;P PMI  &amp;#x200B;  **Scanner Highlights:**  * Overbought (RSI): GOOGL (63), INTC (62), TSLA (62) * Oversold (RSI): CHWY (16), DG (18), M (19), AAL (22), LVS (26), JETS (27) * High IV: MMAT NVAX (+121%), JBLU (+109%), DNA (+101%), UAL (+98%), DAL (+98%), PENN (+97%) * Unusual Options Volume: BEKE (+1687%), QQQ (+481%), AMAT (+445%), CHPT (+414%), OPEN (+397%), EBAY (+370%), JETS (+365%), FDX (+360%), LUV (+357%), WYNN (+291%), DG (+278%)  Full lists here: [Options AI Free Tools](http://url5578.options.ai/ls/click?upn=WHju0C1BRPoBuTdL0xEcqZNWu421ak771SLA5jzpsv95uGEO0ajLP5akEsRW2y6pDZX4QFJa1v3fzfaO9A8yOz0yTeY6cCr88OnTS9pQEP5ZHg20lFbWP5WN5WCScJeUxRNSUM-2BQca-2FYsl6GKpuIew-3D-3Dvu95_yIbKbwLGaUiHkJ2rj-2FVSLO9FkCqgwrqJUZFsR-2FM-2BW6g1NUq5hkNfzxZGFziJBIqnJxtsA-2B6Nrh8CHL3OufU5QY5TkfelaO1-2BVX2-2BiE-2FOZYaESMPanMchodgzcuMV0SgXO0AWKQd0mPpCRbCJDvN9W7GK4SpxLMZ6s3-2BqhfsoD-2FT5qCaSr-2Bx6ivX-2B3L-2BLJKhVnvq7fGiPbyUhS6gr9anv9BN-2FQPOA8tHsEz8rQFhEbz2wttROC7p6PA9Wtaoce9iaR0xysGNWg7CcS5AumUuye35WEh6apMAyKOWlUO-2F6wVRLgjFkFZGxvbT1u-2BLXmMquS5EOj5XIF0lIeksne4FX7w-3D-3D).  &amp;#x200B;  **SPY Expected Move:**  https://preview.redd.it/uhocmgrtp0pb1.png?width=806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47d7885f8fded6e99d2f9e424ce411c4e90eacda  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-09-18 13:43:46]
[Intriguing action,;,; Top options activity this morning shows a a single purchase of 90k+ contracts of $2.50 strike call options expiring 4/19. I've yet to dig in to do any DD yet, but was seeing if anyone else had insight as to this large transaction, or potential catalysts for INVZ?  https://preview.redd.it/qmup4dcwp5hc1.png?width=1113&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69aa0ea868accfb03e3cbfb5cef163c81e6f561d  [Update 2\/8\/24](https://preview.redd.it/28yjcecwp5hc1.png?width=1525&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d91e97264c006611fd1864b60abdd43260e9f88)  Call volume is up 1000% (+/-) from the running average, with 10K calls yesterday, and only 6 put contracts. Of interest, the volume yesterday was for the same strike price and DTE as the original post (See pic). Coincidence, perhaps... Still, I find nothing that tells me an upside/downside catalyst is on the horizon. INVZ did file a Form 6k about a week ago, informing the SEC of a 13% reduction in workforce to better focus capital on it's 2nd iteration of their LiDAR systems, and reduce cash investments on long-term initiative to focus on increasing production of it's current systems. Perhaps a big contract for their systems is in the works, where they have to focus on delivery now v. new initiatives? Purely speculative on my part.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/6yvv18abnchc1.png?width=1553&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=36bca2cf3872763db76684e0fd588e96302287da  Correction to a point above, options trade only in $.05 increments, so I set the limit at $.10, which did fill early this morning, then bounced right back to $.13, or 30% gain. Similar action I observed yesterday. I'm out of day trades for the week, so I'll just sit on this till next week, or longer.   https://preview.redd.it/l60ox3vx4ehc1.png?width=1246&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef6a3dec66f853f6c657c2bd23af23fa3d283fa4,;,; 2024-02-07 12:28:54]

[Expected moves: Microsoft and Alphabet,;,; Alphabet and Microsoft highlight a busy earnings day, both reporting after the close.  Microsoft options are pricing about a 4% move. Prior earnings saw actual moves of -4%, +7%, -1%, -8%. At 60 IV, the options expiring this week are about twice the 30-day IV. The stock itslef has not been that volatile into the event, having essentially flatlined since the first week of October. 30 day realized vol (how much the stock has been actually moving) is just 20, compared to its realized vol over the past year of 29. Sometimes it's interesting to look at trade breakevens zoomed really far out, here's an Iron Condor with strikes based on the expected move, expiring this Friday, on the one-year chart. The levels  are pretty closely aligned with the highs and lows over the past 2 and a half months or so:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/c3164sk8k5wb1.png?width=1128&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a39bb6d6b98642a882e8a6406ffc47b333408450  Alphabet options are pricing about a 4.5% move. Recent earnings have seen moves of +6%, 0%, -3% and -9%. Like MSFT the stock has been flatlining the past few weeks (albeit like everything in the market it's been moving intraday and day to day, just not ending up anywhere new). It's realized vol of 22 over the past 30 days compares to the stock's 34 vol over the past year. Its weekly expiry IV of 70 is about twice its 30 day of 35, a similar 2x to MSFT.  &amp;#x200B;  **Early Movers:**  * Coca-Cola Company (KO) +3.01% * Spotify Technology S.A.

[Married put strike selection?,;,; I was recently looking at the CBOE margin manual regarding rules around married puts and did some analysis on what prices for put strikes and underlyings might be most efficient for margin purposes.  It was not what I expected.  &amp;#x200B;  First an excerpt from the CBOE margin manual:  Initial requirement:  * Pay for put in full. 50% requirement on long underlying position  Maintenance requirement:  * None required on put (no loan value). Provided long put is American style exercise, long underlying position requirement is the lower of: 1) 10% of the put exercise price plus 100% of any out-of-the-money amount, or 2) 25% of long underlying position market value.  &amp;#x200B;  Examples with relatively market-neutral positions (ie, put near delta -1.00) at about 40 DTE:  Example: SPY @$400/sh + 600 strike put  * initial requirement: $200/sh for put + $200/sh for shares * maintenance: lower of $60/sh (10% \* $600/sh +$0/sh OTM) or $100/sh (25%) * stats:    * **put ITM per underlying price: 50% (200/400)**    * **put maintenance margin ratio: 60% ($60/sh versus $100/sh)**  Example: SPY @$400/sh + 450 strike put  * initial requirement: $50.20/sh for put + $200/sh for shares * maintenance: lower of $45/sh (10% \* $450/sh + $0/sh OTM) or $100/sh (25%) * stats:    * **put ITM per underlying price: 25% (50/400)**    * **put maintenance margin ratio: 45% ($45/sh versus $100/sh)** * Note: the put includes a more nontrivial extrinsic value  Example: TSLA @$200/sh + 400 strike put  * initial requirement: $200/sh for put + $100/sh for shares * maintenance: lower of $40/sh (10% \* $400/sh + $0/sh OTM) or $50/sh (25%) * stats:    * **put ITM per underlying price: 100% ($200/sh versus $200/sh)**    * **put maintenance margin ratio: 80% (40/50)**  Example: UNG @$6/sh + 17 strike put  * initial requirement: $11/sh for put + $3/sh for shares * maintenance: lower of $1.70/sh (10% \* $17/sh + $0 OTM) or $1.50/sh (25%) * stats:    * **put ITM per underlying price: 183% ($11/$6)**    * **put maintenance margin ratio: 113% (1.70/1.50)**  &amp;#x200B;  Thoughts on these examples:  * They suggest that the 10% put maintenance margin rule may offer the most margin relief with a *less ITM* put.    * The additional extrinsic value in these contracts might raise the questions about:       * the cost/benefit of having that additional volatility exposure outright       * the cost/benefit of alternative positions such as selling the corresponding call (which eliminates the availability of the 25% stock maintenance margin rule per the CBOE margin manual) * Not all participants may want a deep ITM put.  But if the goal is, eg, an ATM or OTM married put, the analysis should include various ways to achieve the desired combination of delta and volatility exposure (eg, also considering selling stock plus a long call), which is a much broader scope discussion    * Ie, it doesn't make sense to optimize margin only at the expense of expected returns  &amp;#x200B;  [https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/membership/Margin\_Manual.pdf](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/membership/Margin_Manual.pdf),;,; 2023-04-09 13:50:12]
[Expected moves, Carvana, Goldman, Tesla, Netflix,;,; * CARVANA SOARS * GOLDMAN DOWN  * NETFLIX, TESLA AFTER THE CLOSE  Carvana is up an unreal 35%+ this morning after surprising the market with an early earnings report and a debt restructuring plan. This obviously caught the option market completely off guard. Options were only pricing about a 10% move for the rest of this week. But this move is even way beyond what options were pricing for Carvana's assumed reporting date, where they had the expected move at about 27%. Either way, it's difficult for options traders to properly price something moving like CVNA has been lately. It's been having regular 10% type gaps/moves and on past earnings, it's regularly moved 30%+. Options can only pump up so much to account for moves like that as traders and market makers are very wary of properly pricing them (compared to how the stock is moving) and then getting stuck with all that premium when the music stops. Here's how options were priced before the surprise:  https://preview.redd.it/ikdympuvbxcb1.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a938d9c5a583e16395d56e787be0fc8f8820fbe8  &amp;#x200B;  Now attention turns to Netflix and Tesla who report after the close.

This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility). * **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks. * **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move. * **Expiration:** 2023-08-18. * **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are "cheaper." High numbers mean options are "expensive." * **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers. * **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.

[Expected Moves, Docusign, Apple and more,;,; First, a couple of earnings moves from last night, GameStop is slightly higher well off its after-hours highs, and now well inside its expected move. UiPath in a very similar situation, slightly higher but off its post-earnings highs outside market hours and now well inside what options were pricing. On the flipside C3.ai Inc (AI)is down about 14%, slightly more than the 12.5% move options were pricing. The big story since late yesterday is AAPL's quick plunge following reports that the Chinese government is extending the prohibition of Apple‚Äôs iPhones. Apple is down more than 7% since yesterday afternoon.  To put that move in perspective, Apple options were not pricing a 7%+ move until late November. In fact, the recent chart in Apple looks a bit detached from current low IV in the options in general, with the stock having just made 7%+ moves several times since late July:  &amp;#x200B;  https://i.redd.it/2s3cuvpb7umb1.gif  Apple vol is low historically, with 30-day IV about 23, while the past year's realized vol has been 29. The assumption often with a mega-cap stock like AAPL is that while bouts of volatility happen, the stock will reset to a grind higher at some point with low realized and implied vol. But AAPL has been moving for the past month and change in ways that options continue to underprice.  Docusign is the big earnings after the bell. Options are pricing about a 9% move at the moment.

[Expected moves and more: Salesforce, Okta, Chewy and Crowdstrike,;,; The indices are flat to start this Wednesday. Some important economic data just dropped but it doesn't seem to be moving markets too much. GDP was revised lower and ADP jobs was lower than expected. The US 1 and 2-year yields are down slightly.  Today we have a slew of earnings after the bell, with Salesforce and Crowdstrike headlining, but also Okta, Chewy, Five Below and more. See below for current expected moves. We looked at CRM yesterday so let's cover CRWD today. Here's the current expected move chart:   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/l1kkyq5339lb1.png?width=796&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cd94ea845432412c82053680e96b56f1786cf3b3  The expected move of 7% compares to recent actual moves of -2%,    \+3%, -15% and -6%. Of the past 10 earnings, CRWD has only moved more that 7% (today's expected move) twice. Those two moves were 15% and 12%. So most of the time the stock has moved less than 7%, but in the few cases where it didn't it was about twice that. Weekly option IV is about 100, with 30 day out IV half that, around 50.  The stock's actual vol over the past month has been about 50, which matches its 30 day IV, but also its past year's realized vol as well. So 30 day options are priced to exactly how the stock has been trading and this week's are priced for twice that.

[Expected moves this week: SPY, FedEx, Carmax and more,;,; Stock futures are slightly lower this morning, following Friday's slight pullback. Despite Friday's selling SPY finished up 2.2% last week, continuing a strong June that has already seen SPY higher by more than 5%. It's been a pretty textbook Summer grind higher thus far, with very low IV and tight intra-week ranges. As mentioned before, a slow grind higher usually results in low IV, but at the same time, low IV helps set up the conditions for a slow grind, as long gamma in the market prevents the market from rocketing to the upside, and on sell-offs there are usually buyers waiting below. For the market to break from that trend usually takes some sort of fear or FOMO that turns options sellers into buyers, freeing the market up from long gamma and allowing larger moves. Options aren't anticipating that those conditions change anytime soon, with SPY IV just 11 for this week. The expected move for SPY for the week is around 1%.  The biggest thing happening on the economic front this week is Fed Chairman Powell's congressional testimony on Wednesday (during market hours). On the earnings front, we hear from FedEx today, and Carmax on Friday. Options are pricing about a 5% move in FedEx today.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Movers:**  * Innovative Eyewear Inc (LUCY) +24.66% * Vci Global Limited Ordinary Share (VCIG) +34.63% * Nio Inc ADR (NIO) -2.98% * Dragonfly Energy Hldgs Corp (DFLI) -22.22% * Dice Therapeutics Inc (DICE) +37.67% * Xpeng Inc ADR (XPEV) -4.39% * Grab Holdings Ltd Cl A (GRAB) +5.26% * Jd.com Inc ADR (JD) -4.07%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * FedEx Corporation (FDX) Expected Move: 5.55% * La-Z-Boy Incorporated (LZB) Expected Move: 10.65%  Full list here: [Options AI Earnings Calendar](http://url5578.options.ai/ls/click?upn=WHju0C1BRPoBuTdL0xEcqZNWu421ak771SLA5jzpsv-2BU8w7tMzcR-2B7I-2FswbV9O3IjjJgP1PQKL9ll-2BR2phXTZw-3D-3DgEok_yIbKbwLGaUiHkJ2rj-2FVSLO9FkCqgwrqJUZFsR-2FM-2BW6g1NUq5hkNfzxZGFziJBIqnJxtsA-2B6Nrh8CHL3OufU5QY5TkfelaO1-2BVX2-2BiE-2FOZYaESMPanMchodgzcuMV0SgXO0AWKQd0mPpCRbCJDvN9W2oKrLWQgbKd-2BD2jcyiPpkicL-2FJUuo63-2FveixC-2BJhHYJSxTe0Ly08-2B9eNxxMVuSKLZBckHdwcpJQdDgo1chwwQ-2BM1qvZAXzFHF90HjaJulbNzXao-2FUK1a-2F3YRoofWkk5f9cibfVzzPmTfA7kiYw0aRT4xbTHjnny7XLOQ8k0cc-2FN7MzBqTcqBbUrzEJo300rTg-3D-3D) (free)  &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar:**  * At 08:30 AM (EST) Housing Starts MoM (May) Estimates: -1.2, Prior: 2.2 * At 08:30 AM (EST) Building Permits MoM (May) Estimates: 0.6, Prior: -1.4 * At 08:30 AM (EST) Housing Starts (May) Estimates: 1.4, Prior: 1.401 * At 08:30 AM (EST) Building Permits (May) Estimates: 1.42, Prior: 1.417  &amp;#x200B;  **Scanner Highlights:**  *Overbought (RSI):* TSLA (86), ORCL (84), DAL (84), ADBE (82), JETS (80)  *Oversold (RSI)*: CGC (6), SQQQ (26), SPXS (27), ZIM (34), UNH (35)  *High IV:* NKLA (+239%), SPCE (+176%), AMC (+162%), UVXY (+145%), BYND (+140%)  *Unusual Options Volume:* ASHR (+1627%), SPCE (+1449%), FXI (+985%), GLW (+772%), FFIE (+688%), ADBE (+656%), RBLX (+506%), FDX (+500%)  Full lists here: [Options AI Free Tools](http://url5578.options.ai/ls/click?upn=WHju0C1BRPoBuTdL0xEcqZNWu421ak771SLA5jzpsv8cedLq-2BOIzmLf53JNdlOJzPwbR_yIbKbwLGaUiHkJ2rj-2FVSLO9FkCqgwrqJUZFsR-2FM-2BW6g1NUq5hkNfzxZGFziJBIqnJxtsA-2B6Nrh8CHL3OufU5QY5TkfelaO1-2BVX2-2BiE-2FOZYaESMPanMchodgzcuMV0SgXO0AWKQd0mPpCRbCJDvN9W2oKrLWQgbKd-2BD2jcyiPpkicL-2FJUuo63-2FveixC-2BJhHYJBVcNzuCs-2FDGLYrDlM9gDZkaUKavep8QhTuv0AJoeDRfYqXOAbFxtRxn4dcXe0rbnVZ0qRi-2BG4e5vEkvy7dqW4gTd26ooweI21a5aaLucO0ShAlg-2FdhqFWsCXCcLIjAReClAP6vZM2FadeArSvjv-2Fhw-3D-3D).  &amp;#x200B;  **Chart of the Day:**  FedEx options are pricing in about a 5.5% move for earnings.  https://preview.redd.it/bz8mh1i3867b1.png?width=870&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=671c1ee10c8c0f67761f4e79a2314f2b125dabdd,;,; 2023-06-20 13:00:52]
[Expected Moves: Meta, IBM, Servicenow and more.,;,; The indices are getting pulled in a couple different directions this morning due to some big-cap stocks going in different directions on earnings. Microsoft and Boeing are both higher, both slightly inside the expected move at this point. Alphabet is lower and by slightly more than what options were pricing. That mix has the DJIA going one way and the QQQ's going the other. And the SPY/SPX is saying "Waddya want from me?" (bonus points if you got that).  This afternoon we have Meta earnings. Currently, META options are pricing an almost 7.5% move. That's more than the +4.5% the stock moved last earnings but oh boy, the ones before that? +14%, +23%, and -25%. Massive moves for a company of that size/market cap.   The stock itself has been volatile over the past few months but finds itself in essentially the same place it was in early August. The stock is down about 4% from its mid-Summer highs and up about 10% from its mid-August lows.  One particular thing of note, the weekly options (expiring Friday) are 135 IV or so. The 30day IV is 50. That's a pretty big difference and it results in an expected move chart that is much straighter/flatter than normal meaning a breakeven 30-45 days on a spread trade may only be a small difference in the stock. Here's an example. A call spread expiring this week, targeting the expected move to the upside. It is 25 wide and maxes out at 337.50 to the upside. Its breakeven is 322.60 in the stock:  https://preview.redd.it/y1alrkrtqcwb1.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c6f86b1f1c49dd164f06caa468c5e878e3f42cb  Compare that to a call spread targeting a level $10 higher in the stock on Dec 1st expiry:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/54t2u4nyqcwb1.png?width=902&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d099fd456c1f0dea564c030b1786f46584e8fcfb  The breakeven is less than $4 higher (about 1.2% in the stock), has more room to run to the upside, and an additional 35 days or so to do it. This is just a bullish example, the same would be true looking to the downside. This set-up is very similar to Netflix last week, where the earnings expiry was nearly 3x 30-day IV. As a comparison, MSFT and GOOGL yesterday were 2x. This is just one thing to look out for when choosing expiry, those IV differences can be informative, and one way to compare is via expected move levels and trade breakevens.  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Expected Moves:**  * Meta Platforms, Inc.

[Nvidia Expected Move / Earnings Preview,;,; Stocks begin the day slightly in the green but there are some wild swings in companies that just reported. With PTON down 30%, Foot Locker down 30%, and Abercrombie up 15%. Those were all significantly larger moves than options were pricing.  Of course, the big event of the day is Nvidia NVDA earnings after the close. At the moment, options are pricing about a 9.5% move. Recent earnings have seen actual moves of +25%, +14%, -1%, and +4%. In other words, options are pricing a smaller move than the past two events, which have both seen significantly larger moves. Options expiring Friday have implied vol of about 134, while 30-day IV is around 66.  Since that +25% earnings move in May the stock has remained volatile, but with a 16-17% range since early June. The stock is just shy of its all-time high, with the upper expected move around the big round number of $500, while the lower expected move sits at levels where the stock has bounced twice this summer:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/97hfkzpy4vjb1.png?width=813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ead1c5ab30f70c6dff2decb0653b065f7819c3a6  In other words, options sellers would be hoping the stock held that support if the company disappoints, and found sellers at a big fat number of $500, which would be a new all-time high. One thing to look for in situations like that is if there's open the interest around a round number like $500. And in this case, there is, with the 500 line having significantly more open interest than anything around it, with similar open interest as the near-the-money 450 strike:  https://preview.redd.it/tu1g15xd6vjb1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daf65faf582d3d0429219727507cdb0f1db4feee  That's not a ton to rest your hat on as resistance, but it's something, potential gamma. Therefore, the expected move levels have some reasoning behind them at the moment and may help explain why the expected move is so much less than the past two events. Option buyers of course should be aware of those levels and perhaps look to debit spread to those levels.  As far as how the stock has been moving recently, it's been volatile, but the 30 day actual vol of 49 is in line with how the stock has moved the past year. So it's NVDA being NVDA.  **Early Movers:**  * AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) -21.96% * Peloton Interactive Inc (PTON) -29.90% * Footlocker Inc (FL) -30.04% * Tesla Inc (TSLA) -2.31% * Vci Global Limited Ordinary Share (VCIG) +50.67% * Grab Holdings Ltd Cl A (GRAB) +7.78% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) +0.64% * Apellis Pharmaceuticals Inc (APLS) +26.69% * Iteos Therapeutics Inc (ITOS) +36.85% * Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Company (ANF) +15.35% * Analog Devices (ADI) -4.91% * Nike Inc (NKE) -3.78%  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * **NVIDIA** Corporation (NVDA) Expected Move: **9.31%** * **Snowflake Inc.** (SNOW) Expected Move\*\*: 9.44%\*\* * **Autodesk, Inc.** (ADSK) Expected Move: **5.50%** * **Splunk Inc.** (SPLK) Expected Move: **7.40%** * **NetApp, Inc.** (NTAP) Expected Move: **5.70%** * **Ooma, Inc.** (OOMA) Expected Move: **12.27%**  Full list here: [Options AI Earnings Calendar](http://url5578.options.ai/ls/click?upn=WHju0C1BRPoBuTdL0xEcqZNWu421ak771SLA5jzpsv-2BU8w7tMzcR-2B7I-2FswbV9O3IYMqc0knxD4ENs73FR4K1Rr1Fgo-2FwqDyknm-2B4c-2BQ3V4z9wDW6qmNOwlJCZ6dYTvPyTvoqTC1ZPUKTebNvybVjcp-2BFmPfz2l3b0-2FKclxDdYL4-3D3e6L_yIbKbwLGaUiHkJ2rj-2FVSLO9FkCqgwrqJUZFsR-2FM-2BW6g1NUq5hkNfzxZGFziJBIqnJxtsA-2B6Nrh8CHL3OufU5QY5TkfelaO1-2BVX2-2BiE-2FOZYaESMPanMchodgzcuMV0SgXO0AWKQd0mPpCRbCJDvN9W0Trhd5va2JQLYW2hN32pQ2-2BO5xRqnabuTXsdJ5nBsD9PcFHvPn2oIo6tLZ7Hdc0KItR4DlJVGilbSUkQi4vXiMAxQNZ2f1UzEXyfuukq28-2FIvYVt2ujM8tFJSHheWNpVDkV07v-2FV5lhL0nJINjlnhCFdmev-2BbDDobkTCZysOhDBMr8Xp2z9bvuD-2FE9QP0JCOA-3D-3D)  **Today's Economic Data:**  * At 09:45 AM (EST) S&amp;P Global Manufacturing PMI (Aug) Estimates: 49.%, Prior: 49 * At 09:45 AM (EST) S&amp;P Global Services PMI (Aug) Estimates: 52.2, Prior: 52.3 * At 09:45 AM (EST) S&amp;P Global Composite PMI (Aug) Estimates: 52, Prior: 52 * At 10:00 AM (EST) New Home Sales MoM (Jul) Impact: Medium * Jackson Hole Symposium Impact: High  &amp;#x200B;  **On the Scanner**  * **Overbought (RSI):** LLY (78), X (74), TEVA (67), TJX (64), NVAX (63) * **Oversold (RSI):** HE (13), SE (17), M (18), C (20), JWN (23), UPS (25) * **High IV:** FL (+178%), ORCL (+148%), GPS (+135%), KSS (+125%) * **Unusual Options Volume:** M (+1090%), FL (+1083%), NVAX (+1034%), KSS (+1030%), WYNN (+957%), JWN (+862%), PTON (+797%), ZM (+529%)  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-08-23 13:49:56]
[OTM Call Optimal Strike Price,;,; This is a simulated trade only.   However, I noticed that the leverage effect for the strike price at 250 is the greatest.   I bought calls when the share is around $120. Why didn't the far out OTM call give the highest leverage in this case? Is it to assume that the return is the highest, if the share price is closest to the strike price of the call, in this case 250? I always thought the deep OTM call could give the highest return if the stock goes in the right direction. It doesn't look like that though. What am I missing here?  Same question maybe ask differently, if you knew where the stock is heading, which call would you buy then to achieve the max return?  https://preview.redd.it/jd6l5r4e2ila1.png?width=1008&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e1ab3945955ea65eb9af86abd229088c9c20023,;,; 2023-03-03 10:25:02]
[Expected moves: Pepsi, Delta, JP Morgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, Amazon and more.,;,; Futures are once again bid higher. Stocks were green pre-market even before the PPI release which followed up well to yesterday's CPI, and was also cooler than expected. Both are encouraging signs about inflation. Earnings season started this morning for all intents and purposes with Pepsi and Delta Airlines being the most interesting names reporting so far. Both stocks are higher, and both have beaten their expected move slightly (so far). This is something to keep an eye on as earnings season kicks off. As mentioned yesterday, IV and expected moves in individual stocks are the lowest they've been in years. That does not mean options are completely wrong per se, vol is low for a reason across the market... But what it does mean is that individual stocks are more likely to move beyond their expected move on earnings than on average. Simply because the moves are that much smaller than typical. It also means the vol crushes after earnings are less, which may be helpful in deciding whether or not to hold positions through the event.   It's also entirely possible that any outsized moves happen more often in one direction than the other, which has more to do with the overall trend in the market. right now that trend is higher as we enter earnings so keep an eye on whether stocks beat expected moves to the upside more than the downside, or vice versa. Tomorrow morning we hear from the first batch of big banks, including JP Morgan and Wells Fargo.

[Expected moves, NFP jobs, SPY, VIX Apple and more.,;,; Non Farm Payrolls drop at 8:30 ET and suddenly take on new significance after the market reaction yesterday to ADP employment data. As pointed out in this space a few times recently, stocks have largely ignored rising treasury yields (higher interest rate assumptions) over the past few months as the fears of a bad recession faded a little. But with recent strong data and hawkish words from the Fed, yields have plowed higher and traders showed some concern for the first time in a while the past 2 days. The 1-year yield is now at its highest level since 2000, the 2yr traded yesterday at its highest level since 2006 and the 10yr is at its highest level since 2007. Where yields go next are likely to affect the market's next moves and the NFP this morning will be the last data point in a slew of news we received in the second part of this week. The VIX got as high as 17 yesterday, indicating some renewed interest in option buying. It pulled back a bit late and is now 15.80. But this is the first bit of life option buyers have shown in months. Futures are basically unchanged into the NFP print. The expected move for SPY today is about 0.5% with the QQQ about 0.8%.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Movers:**     * Gorilla Technology Group Inc (GRRR) +59.33% * Prestige Wealth Inc (PWM) +116.67% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +3.38% * Zhong Yang Financial Group Limited (TOP) +13.64% * Tesla Inc (TSLA) -0.30% * Alibaba Group Holding ADR (BABA) +2.81% * Xpeng Inc ADR (XPEV) -2.69% * Nio Inc ADR (NIO) -0.42% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.03% * Levi Strauss &amp; Company Cl A (LEVI) -7.17% * Alphabet Cl A (GOOGL) -0.17%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**     * ImmunoPrecise Antibodies Ltd.

[Expected Moves this Week: Low IV into NFP and an Earnings Lull, SPY, QQQ, IWM and more.,;,; ## Market View  **Last Week ‚Äì Another positive week and an IV collapse.**  SPY was up 3.5% last week, a move much larger than options were pricing. But because the move was to the upside, and came on the heels of some relieving bank headlines, implied vol collapsed. The VIX is now within a point of its lowest levels of 2023 and is down from 26 to 18.70 since the SVB drama, and actually at or below its historical mean. IV for SPY options expiring this week are in the 10-13 IV range, down significantly from the weekly IV near 30 we saw into the CPI and FOMC in March. There is a slight uptick in SPY IV into the next CPI April 12th, but only to 16 IV at the moment.  **This Week ‚Äì A Jobs Report, but on a holiday.**  SPY options are pricing about a 1.2% move for the 4 day week. This is a holiday week in the second half with Passover beginning Wednesday night and then markets closed for Good Friday. There will be some focus on the NFP release on Friday as market participants are now on the lookout for any signs of recession but the reaction will not come until the following Monday. Stock valuations are on the high side historically after the recent recovery in the market and the set-up into earnings season later this month isn‚Äôt necessarily pricing in the effects of a possible recession. So any signs of cracks on the economic front will be a focus. However, the bull case is that if the Fed is indeed winding down rate hikes and if inflation continues to moderate, the economy may have escaped the worst possible scenario. The NFP this week, CPI on the 12th, and the first 2 weeks of earnings reports in late April should give some clues.  Last week we highlighted the rapid IV decline in The Russell 2000. Options in IWM were pricing in a 5-day move of 4% two weeks ago, 2.7% last week, and this week just 1.8% (4 day week). So the options market is now pricing in much more typical moves in small-cap stocks than in the midst of the banking turmoil. Below is the IWM chart showing the large recent moves and the much smaller expected move now as a result of a collapse in IV (with this Friday highlighted):  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/s7q87qrr1jra1.png?width=1249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aed5a3b6ca504ed477a72f0d38d8a9dc68113bed  **Expected Moves for This Week**¬†([via Options AI‚Äôs free tools](https://tools.optionsai.com/))  * SPY¬†**1.2%** * QQQ **1.6%**¬† * IWM¬†**1.8%**  * DIA¬†**1.1%**   &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar**  * Monday ‚Äì **ISM Manufacturing** * Tuesday ‚Äì **ADP Employment, ISM Services** * Friday ‚Äì **Non-Farm Payrolls (markets closed)**  &amp;#x200B;  **Unusual Option Volume Friday**  * **HAS, AI, BB, SNOW, TSLA, UPST, UBS, ARKK, CLOV, DDOG, QQQ, SPY**  &amp;#x200B;  ## Earnings This Week  Via the Expected move, weekly IV, and prior earnings moves (starting with most recent).  Earnings are really light this week but pick up in the second half of April. Next week some of the banks report, with Citi and Wells Fargo late in the week, then things really heat up the week of April 17th with Schwab, Goldman and Bank of America followed by Netflix and Tesla. The week of April 24th sees the big tech names like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet etc.  You can take a peek ahead on the [Options AI Earnings Calendar](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings-calendar) (free to use) showing expected moves as currently priced and past moves for comparison.

[Expected moves, Core PCE, SPY, QQQ,;,; Futures are higher this morning. The market still has to digest the Fed's preferred inflation measure of core PCE which drops before the open. It's been a positive week for SPY, up about 1.1% coming into this morning (not counting the futures being higher). That's about in line with the move options were pricing for the week, so a positive day today would take stocks beyond what options had priced. That slow grind in a low-vol environment can be frustrating for option sellers as upside calls are really cheap and really close to the money when a trade is entered... so trade management on a slow creep higher is important. Option vol remains low and may get lower into the close preceding what is a quasi 3-and-a-half day weekend that market makers will not want to be owning a ton of premium into.  **Today's (0DTE) expected moves:**  * SPY: 0.5% * QQQ: 0.7%  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market:**  * Renalytix Ai Plc ADR (RNLX) +41.06% * Genfit S.A.

[Expected moves: VIX pickup, SPY, QQQ Grind lower. Rare Friday Earns from Palo Alto,;,; Stocks are lower again to start Friday. It's been a rough week overall, with the SPY down about 2.5% or so. That's more than double the move options were pricing, and the moves have been a bit more than 0DTE options have been pricing each day. Near-term options are waking up a bit, with 0DTE pricing in expected moves for SPY now out at about 0.7% or so each day, that's up from just 0.4% a few weeks ago. The VIX is now near 19 meaning 30-day vol is back to about its historical average. One interesting data point to add to this is that the SPY itself has not been THAT volatile. It's off a bit more than 5% from its highs, and the recent selling has been a grind lower, not much panic selling. That's not just a *vibe*, the realized vol in SPY for the past 30 days is still just 10. That will likely begin to increase a bit with the past week seeing moves in excess of what options were pricing, but again, the selling has been orderly in the major indices thus far.  Nothing on the economic data front today but next week is the Jackson Hole Conference which takes on some additional significance after this week's more hawkish than expected FOMC minutes as well as what's going on in China's markets.  A rare after-hours on Friday earnings report today from Palo Alto Networks. That may have some traders spooked a bit as it does feel like a Friday news dump (where you'd try to bury bad news when everyone is already away from their desks). However, the last SP 500 company to do the same was Nike in 2020 and that report was good. So who knows. Here's how options are trying to price the event, an odd one as you have to go out to next Friday's options, not today's, to trade options that capture the event:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/54a32hdvevib1.png?width=823&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5971ace74cf257bca6c1e2c9d0c4d9f6196a213  The 8% move matches that prior reports actual move of +8%.

This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move. * **Expiration:** 2023-06-16. * **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are "cheaper." High numbers mean options are "expensive." * **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers. * **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.

[Highest Earnings Volatility for the Week of October 16, 2023,;,; ,;,; 2023-10-13 13:27:45]
[Expected moves this week: SPY, QQQ, FOMC minutes, Jobs number.,;,; Futures are basically flat this morning into a holiday-shortened session. On the economic data front, the ISM PMI number will drop shortly after the open. Earnings reports are super light this week with nothing really of note today. Last week was a very positive one for stocks with the SPY up 2.3% on the week, a move more than double what options were pricing. With the move higher, IV was even lower, with the VIX actually putting in an intraday print below 13 on Friday. Once again, that's low levels of IV that the market hasn't seen since Covid dropped. Considering this is a holiday-shortened week those low levels are likely warranted, or at least understandable as traders do not want to be sitting on long premium during the dog days of Summer trading. But as has been mentioned in this space, it doesn't take much for stocks to move beyond those small expected moves, particularly on weeks like last week where there's a persistent bid in the market on a slow grind higher. Traders should be very very aware of both the risk of long premium, but also of how tight the breakeven levels of short premium trades can be with IV this low. Active trade management with small-win mentalities is how many traders approach these conditions.   For this week, SPY options are pricing just under a 1% move for what amounts to a 3-and-a-half-day week. That could change coming out of the holiday for the final 3 days as traders may re-adjust to more regular market hours. That's particularly true this week as the economic calendar picks up on Wednesday with FOMC minutes, then Thursday ISM services PMI, ADP jobs, and of course the non-farm payrolls on Friday. The earnings calendar is light this week but picks up in the second half of the month with banks and airlines beginning to report mid-month with big tech rolling in late month.   &amp;#x200B;  **Today's expected move (0DTE)**   * SPY 0.4%  * QQQ 0.5%  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market:**     * Tesla Inc (TSLA) +6.13% * Nio Inc ADR (NIO) +4.44% * Micron Technology (MU) +0.19% * Xpeng Inc ADR (XPEV) +7.53% * Lucid Group Inc (LCID) +1.60% * Alphabet Cl C (GOOG) -0.32% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +2.16% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.32% * Unitedhealth Group Inc (UNH) -0.48% * Astrazeneca Plc ADR (AZN) -6.62% * Li Auto Inc ADR (LI) +5.84% * Zhong Yang Financial Group Limited (TOP) -5.22%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**   none of note  Full list here: [Options AI Earnings Calendar](http://url5578.options.ai/ls/click?upn=WHju0C1BRPoBuTdL0xEcqZNWu421ak771SLA5jzpsv-2BU8w7tMzcR-2B7I-2FswbV9O3IjjJgP1PQKL9ll-2BR2phXTZw-3D-3DI8Ym_yIbKbwLGaUiHkJ2rj-2FVSLO9FkCqgwrqJUZFsR-2FM-2BW6g1NUq5hkNfzxZGFziJBIqnJxtsA-2B6Nrh8CHL3OufU5QY5TkfelaO1-2BVX2-2BiE-2FOZYaESMPanMchodgzcuMV0SgXO0AWKQd0mPpCRbCJDvN9W1GqkaDtImOkH-2Bbf1rhBfNkJBwlIHnnf3rnGYrTRJbV53inlMhXT9KYHuKttkJlHI07mLOUxQwQn95JkZBpkSiMSR7neN-2FOUxGNgHxdbUlWDEDktnN7lJEPQ-2BTeDCg2QwMHUdLJCl3QcGKqcu5GnI6jIw3yMfzVU2ViljSittYGoBR4tw1Bve23XIL5Ah1JqPw-3D-3D)  &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar:**     * At 09:45 AM (EST) S&amp;P Global Manufacturing PMI (Jun) Estimates: 46.3, Prior: 48.4 * At 10:00 AM (EST) ISM Manufacturing PMI (Jun) Estimates: 47, Prior: 46.9 * At 10:00 AM (EST) ISM Manufacturing Employment (Jun) Estimates: 50.5, Prior: 51.4  &amp;#x200B;  **Scanner Highlights:**   Based on the prior day's trading action.     * **Overbought (RSI):** DAL (87), AAL (81), LUV (80), OSTK (80), JBLU (79), JETS (78), AAPL (78), OPEN (77), SNAP (74) * **Oversold (RSI):** OKTA (39), ETSY (39), MU (40), KO (40), TGT (40), ABBV (40), DOCU (41), GLD (41), JD (41) * **High IV:** NKLA (+211%), AMC (+206%), MANU (+172%), AZN (+136%), OSTK (+116%), SOFI (+114%), BUD (+113%), AMGN (+102%), RIVN (+102%), MRK (+101%), SPOT (+100%) * **Unusual Options Volume:** CMCSA (+1401%), BITO (+657%), XLI (+561%), RIG (+556%), OSTK (+531%), NKE (+486%), MSTR (+475%), CCL (+473%), AAPL (+450%), JPM (+440%), UPS (+398%)  Full lists here: [Options AI Free Tools](http://url5578.options.ai/ls/click?upn=WHju0C1BRPoBuTdL0xEcqZNWu421ak771SLA5jzpsv8cedLq-2BOIzmLf53JNdlOJzY-4L_yIbKbwLGaUiHkJ2rj-2FVSLO9FkCqgwrqJUZFsR-2FM-2BW6g1NUq5hkNfzxZGFziJBIqnJxtsA-2B6Nrh8CHL3OufU5QY5TkfelaO1-2BVX2-2BiE-2FOZYaESMPanMchodgzcuMV0SgXO0AWKQd0mPpCRbCJDvN9W1GqkaDtImOkH-2Bbf1rhBfNkJBwlIHnnf3rnGYrTRJbV5FWE7SR5ZYQ38PnWAVxYkk6phKmNLWVeaSOon7itLSkqDoFb0fXzcESRQ6FiLJhOH6TO-2F6u4u0cIyP066EqG8uMbwr2XCLWq9cGtiMiWTE4McvzQS4MMp8v7tzQyXuKeeHFcxOACyKedh7OcxtR1dBQ-3D-3D).  &amp;#x200B;  **Chart of the Day:**  SPY options are pricing less than a 1% move for the week but that could change out of the holiday.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/7r7h6kao3r9b1.png?width=840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfcf65a33ac01fc015eea4825b72938c0e803b15,;,; 2023-07-03 13:22:44]

[Expected moves: A little life in market vol, SPY QQQ VIX Netflix and more,;,; Stock futures are lower for the second straight day. It's a big two days for economic data, following yesterday's Fed minutes. This morning, ADP reported \~500k private sector jobs added, doubling expectations. That sent futures lower as it's yet another sign the FOMC is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer and potentially be more aggressive with raises. The US 2-year treasury yield is above 5% near this year's high, but more importantly, nearing levels it hasn't seen since 2006. Stocks have absorbed higher interest rate assumptions over the past 2 months quite well, rising with the rising yields. That played out mainly due to lessening fears of a recession (and the AI hype driving tech stocks higher). If the jobs number comes in hot tomorrow it will be just the latest data point pointing to a persistently strong economy, driving yields higher, and assumptions of a more hawkish Fed for the balance of 2023. There are signs elsewhere in the economic data of an economy that's cooling off in certain sectors, but jobs and hiring has remained strong, and we'll find out more on the front tomorrow. This 2-day pullback in stocks is breathing a little life into option vol. The VIX is now \~15.30, up from 13 just a few trading days ago.   As was mentioned in this space, vol got about as low as you'd ever see over the past two weeks. That didn't mean it would immediately go higher, but it was unlikely to go much lower. A 15.30 VIX is still historically low but it does show a little appetite for traders to buy options. Something we haven't seen much of over the past several weeks. Skew is near the highest levels of the past few years, meaning downside put strikes were already more expensive than upside call strikes. That is largely reflective of a low IV environment where the percentage differences get magnified, but keep an eye on that skew number as the VIX rises, if it remains high, it would be showing continued demand for puts even at higher vol, and therefore be a good indication of any fear in the market.   With earnings season approaching, it's also interesting to look at how low individual stock IV got and how it's pricing upcoming earnings. Netflix, which reports on the 19th, has 55 IV at the moment for the event, pricing in about an 8% move (that includes all the time leading up to the event as well.) For perspective, in Netflix's last 6 earnings, the stock has moved less than 8% just twice and has had +/-7% moves 5 out of 6 times. In other words, vol is low in most individual stocks as compared o the past 2 years, and with earnings right around the corner, you'll see much smaller expected moves on average (as of now).  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Movers:**     * Tesla Inc (TSLA) -0.44% * Allarity Therapeutics Inc (ALLR) -51.57% * Bioxcel Therapeutics Inc (BTAI) +23.73% * Genius Sports Ltd (GENI) +9.12% * Meta Platforms Inc (META) +1.70% * Lucid Group Inc (LCID) -1.48% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +0.29% * Riot Platforms Inc (RIOT) +3.24% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.16% * Affirm Holdings Inc Cl A (AFRM) -5.06% * Perion Network Ltd (PERI) +7.22%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**     * Levi Strauss &amp; Co.

[My NVDA Earnings Play: Neutral Stance with a Focus on IV Drop,;,; I'm expecting a strong report from NVDA. Under such circumstances I usually open ratio calls, especially when the stock is at highs, but this time I chose not to take that risk.  Instead, I've opened a relatively neutral position, but with strong negative vega, anticipating a drop in IV post-earnings report:  * Bought 3 Dec15 Puts at $500 * Sold 12 Dec15 Puts at $450 * Bought 6 Nov24 Puts at $465 * Bought 1 Dec15 Call at $540 * Sold 1 Nov24 Call at $560 * Debit: $2567. Collateral: $30000.  After a positive earnings report, I'm expecting a drop below $500 and aim to profit from the Dec15 $500 Puts. Still, just in case, I bought the Dec15 $540 Call as a hedge against a surprisingly strong report. I'll decide what to do with the short $560 call based on market reaction.  As a safety measure, I also bought 6 Nov24 $465 Puts. While I don‚Äôt strongly anticipate an unpleasant surprise, the significant rise in November could still lead to severe disappointments.  https://preview.redd.it/wfu1gm8irq1c1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47f61343dbd042759f522bca4e01a921891bfb1c  UPD1: My expectations for a strong NVIDIA (NVDA) report were mostly met, but I anticipated the market's downturn to happen a bit later. Nevertheless, it's not a big issue. As expected, the implied volatility (IV) in December options plummeted, and my position is holding up well. However, I can't boast about profits yet because the Nov24 puts I had as a hedge against any sudden negative surprises also became worthless.  Just before yesterday's report, I decided to hedge a bit against a minor decline by buying a Dec15 Straddle at $540, selling 2 Dec15 Puts at $460, and 3 Dec15 Calls at $630, costing me an additional $3828.  So, in total, the position's debit stands at $6395.  I'm not a fan of such situations, but I'm banking on the stock correcting itself in the next 2-3 weeks, along with the broader market ‚Äì I'm still holding some¬†SOXS¬†and¬†SQQQ.  https://preview.redd.it/k86v0y6jby1c1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dda234e908c80ee24f954caf7202d7aaa570f65d  UPD2: I've closed my position in NVDA's Dec15 options. Some of the bought puts expired OTM on Nov 24th, but this didn't prevent me from achieving a credit of $8367 upon closing yesterday. In total, that's a profit of $1972 minus a commission of $81.64.  I was asked why I opened such a 'complex' position when my main aim was the IV crush? Wouldn't it have been simpler to sell a strangle? For instance, the same Dec15 Puts 450 and Dec15 Calls 540?  Yes, it would have been simpler. And it might even have been more profitable. However, the profitability is debatable.  I wouldn't have dared to sell that volume of puts without at least partial insurance. And selling naked calls on NVDA before the earnings report, I consider downright reckless.  With my approach I was prepared for any scenario, and I was likely to secure my $1.5-2k profit regardless.  https://preview.redd.it/i9ox84qbnc3c1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c60a2f22f45a7ddf45df56fdc86d82ec7592285b,;,; 2023-11-21 18:10:00]

[Expected Moves: Low IV Trading and Earnings from Netflix, Tesla, Goldman, IBM and more.,;,; ## Market View  **Last Week ‚Äì Closing with a VIX Level we haven‚Äôt seen in years**  SPY finished higher by about 0.8% last week, another fairly quiet move inside what options were pricing (+/- 1.6%). The VIX was lower on the week and its closing low Friday near 17 is its lowest level since the late 2021all time market highs. The range on the week was also inside the expected move, with less than a 1.5% difference between the intra-week highs and lows. In other words, IV is low, but realized moves for the past few weeks have been even less.  **This Week ‚Äì Earnings heat up as IV cools**  SPY options are pricing just a 1.1% move for the upcoming week. That‚Äôs as low a move as we‚Äôve seen in quite some time, a factor traders need to be aware of into what could be some idiosyncratic moves in individual stocks as they begin to report. A good example came Friday as several of the large banks reported. The banking system has obviously been a focus for traders the past month, and banks giving insight in that environment would typically come in high vol environment. But because the market had stabilized since the regional bank chaos, the big banks that reported on Friday actually reported in a low IV environment. The result was two of the banks, PNC and Wells Fargo barely moving, well inside their expected moves, while the two that did see moves (JPM and Citi) nearly doubled their expected moves to the upside.  A general rule of thumb on expected moves into earnings is that a stock will stay at or inside its expected move roughly 70% of the time. But the IV backdrop does factor into those numbers. When IV is historically high, it is more likely that a stock stays within its expected move, with the moves outside expectations sometimes massive, but occurring less often. However, when the IV backdrop is low, moves outside expectations tend to happen more often, but the outsized moves themselves tend to be less massive. This makes sense intuitively. Had JPM reported in the middle of the banking turmoil of last month, and shown a net inflow of deposits from regional banks, while its IV, and the market‚Äôs overall IV had been alot higher, its move may have been even more. And that‚Äôs not just due to sentiment, although that‚Äôs a big factor, but it also has to do with the amount of short gamma that is in the market at high IV levels. High IV can create air pockets for stocks to move through. Whereas lower IV backdrops can create a long gamma backdrop, acting as a governor on moves.  The TL:DR version of that is that moves in low-vol environments are smaller overall, with less short gamma in the market. But because the expected move is so much smaller as well, moves outside expectations happen more often. The 4 banks that reported Friday are a small sample size, but the fact that two barely moved, and the other two doubled their expected move on a move that would have been considered normal just a few weeks ago, is a good illustration.  So what does that mean for trade strategies? Credit spreads create really tight windows for a stock to stay within, and it will often be self-fulfilling. The fact that the SPY‚Äôs last two weeks saw moves of just 0.4% and 0.8% is indicative of that. However, when a stock does violate that expected move, it won‚Äôt take much, and is likely to happen slightly more often. Credit Spreads should be defined risk because the premium received is not enough to make up for the fact that a % move of a couple percent could be a 4x loss. And debit spreads could look to take advantage of that as well. For instance, the likelihood of a massive move on earnings of 20% in a low IV/long gamma environment of a stock expecting a 5% move is very unlikely, however, that stock moving 6-7%, slightly beyond the expected move will happen more often. And because of that, a debit spread at the expected move could see a 3-4x return when that stock goes beyond expectations.  E.G., a stock trading $100 with a 5% expected move, the trader looking to sell premium should be very careful to define risk narrowly, perhaps a dollar wide at or beyond the expected move, so that a move to $92 or $108 (beyond the tight $95 to $105 expected move) doesn‚Äôt cause outsized losses. And on the flipside, there can be an opportunity for a long premium trader looking for a move beyond $95 or $105, with say a 105/106 call spread or a 95/94 put spread, rather than a lotto ticket call or put. The chances that the stock will make a massive move is less likely, but the chance it will move slightly beyond the move, is a slightly more frequent occurrence in low IV.  *Note, although a 17 VIX is the lowest level for the past few years, it isn‚Äôt super low historically and could just be a blip before it goes higher, or it could go much lower (mid to low teens is historically low). However, it is now lower than the historical mean, something we haven‚Äôt seen much of in recent years*.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/adnfymvpkaua1.png?width=1157&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdd4805f4f5ef9322410f18ed9dde057fca1d8db  &amp;#x200B;  **Expected Moves for This Week**¬†([via Options AI](https://tools.optionsai.com/))  * SPY¬†**1.1%** * QQQ **1.6%**¬† * IWM¬†**1.7%**  * DIA¬†**1.1%**   **Economic Calendar**  * Tuesday ‚Äì **Housing starts, Fed Speech (Bowman)** * Thursday ‚Äì **Initial jobless claims, Philly Manufacturing**  **Unusual Option Volume Thursday**  * BA, HON, NVDA, BUD, META, NFLX, SCHW  ##   ## Earnings This Week  Via the [Options AI Earnings Calendar](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings-calendar) (free to use) showing expected moves as currently priced and past moves for comparison.  ***Monday***  * **Charles Schwab SCHW ‚Äì Expected Move: 8%** \[Prior\] -3% -2% -2  ***Tuesday***  * **Bank of America BAC ‚Äì** Expected Move: 4.3% \[Prior\] +2% +6% 0% * **Goldman Sachs ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.4% \[Prior\] -6% +2% +3% * **Lockheed Martin LMT ‚Äì** Expected Move: 2.4% \[Prior\] +2% +9% +1 -2% * **Netflix NFLX** ‚Äì Expected Move: 7.4% \[Prior\] +8% +13% +7% -35% * **United Airlines UAL** ‚Äì Expected Move: 5.2% \[Prior\] -1% +5% +1% +1%  ***Wednesday***  * **Morgan Stanley MS ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.6% \[Prior\] +6% -5% 0% * **ASML Holding ASML ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.7% \[Prior\] +2% +6% +3% +3% * **Tesla TSLA ‚Äì** Expected Move: 7% \[Prior\] +11% -7% +10% +3% * **IBM IBM ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.7% \[Prior\] -5% +5% -5% +7%  ***Thursday***  * **Taiwan Semi TSM ‚Äì** Expected Move: 4.3% \[Prior\] +6% +4% +3% * **American Express AXP ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.7% \[Prior\] +10% -2% +2% -3%,;,; 2023-04-16 18:45:00]

This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).      - **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.  - **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.  - **Expiration:** 2023-08-25.  - **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are "cheaper." High numbers mean options are "expensive."  - **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.  - **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.  - **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have "weeklies", the underlying is "too cheap", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.,;,; 2023-08-21 14:24:59]
[Quarantining Risk,;,;    In trading, ‚Äúpicking someone off‚Äù means trading against a counterparty who would flake on the price they offered you if they knew what you know.  If I lift an offer on a TSLA March call option because I‚Äôm bullish, the market-maker on the other side of my trade doesn‚Äôt care. They would still sell me the call even if I texted them my rationale. But if I had the divine knowledge that Elon was going to tweet in the next 10 seconds that earnings would be reported in March not February, then I would be knowingly ‚Äúpicking off‚Äù the market-maker. As an options trader, you need to defend against pick-offs. You also want alerts if someone else is making a price that is not incorporating material, public info. For example, if an OPEC meeting date was moved there might be a tiny window when you could disguise a calendar spread as a routine roll when really you are trying to pick off the other side before they get the memo.  \[In reality, when such news happens, market-makers will ‚Äúsweep‚Äù all the resting customer orders with price limits below or above the option‚Äôs new fair value. It‚Äôs very difficult to pick off another professional who is consuming a real-time news feed.\]  A few categories of pick-offs:  **Pickoff trades related to changes in dates.**  If earnings are moved from early Feb to early March, then the ‚Äúearnings volatility‚Äù needs to come out of the Feb expiry since you are no longer exposed to it, and the March options which now contain that volatility must appreciate relatively.  **Pickoffs related to change in carry**  If a stock announces a change in its dividend that will affect the carry embedded in the options. If a dividend is slashed, the calls go up relative to the puts. Market makers need to be on top of how corporate actions affect the inputs into their pricing models.  **Pickoffs related to changes in baskets**  If an ETF‚Äôs constituents change that affects vol of the underlying basket. If an ETF restricts creations, this can lead to the options and ETF becoming mispriced (one day I‚Äôll tell the story of how this personally cost me 6 figures).  ## Pickoffs In Real Life  The tradition of trading floors is full of insane prop betting stories (NYMEX vets have so many to choose from but my personal favorite was watching one guy successfully pound 20 Coors Lites in an hour in one of the upstairs offices).  But picking people off can be as easy as making bets with folks who are arithmetically challenged. Most people are. You only need to look up [polls](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1457115978496548866?s=20) by u/10kdiver to see that even professional investors, a subset of the population who should be able to compute a return, struggle numerically.  I am overstating the case a bit.  1. I don‚Äôt know how many of those respondents are professional investors. I‚Äôd also admit there are times I‚Äôm impatient and just take a guess just to see the results. This is probably common behavior. 2. When confronted with a bet, people‚Äôs defenses go up. They are wary of strangers bearing gifts and will assume there‚Äôs a catch.  Now that was a long-winded, but hopefully fun, introduction to a story that I will improve your numerical intuition and illuminate a lesson that is central to both investing and engineering problems.  # The Proposition  My 3rd-grader came home with a packet of math worksheets from school. Two of the sheets, a total of 10 questions, were incomplete. He said the teacher didn‚Äôt require those sheets to be done.  What a bummer.  I thought they were the best questions from the whole packet. I asked him to solve the total of 10 questions but decided to make my request a little spicier. I offered him the following bet:  *If you get them all correct, I will give you $5. Otherwise, you owe me $5.*  He thought for a moment, then accepted. Before he went off to work on them, I started to wonder if my impulsive proposition was fair.  ## Is It A Fair Bet?  After eyeballing the questions, I estimated he had a 90% chance of getting any question correct. Another way to say that, is I expect he gets 1 wrong *on average*. Right off the bat, I think I‚Äôm going to win. It‚Äôs not a fair bet.  This led me to compute a couple numbers.  1) If my estimate of 90% hit rate per question is correct, what‚Äôs the chance he gets them all correct?  .90¬π‚Å∞ = 35%  That means he‚Äôs almost a 2‚Äì1 underdog  2) What would his hit rate need to be per question to make the bet fair?  First we need to convert what a fair bet means in math language. This is straightforward. Since it‚Äôs an even $5 bet then the fair proposition would not be, on average, he gets 1 wrong, but that he *gets all the questions correct 50% of the time.*  x¬π‚Å∞ = 50%  x = .50\^(1/10)  x = 93.3%  So if he had a 93.3% chance of getting any single question correct, then he has a 50% chance of winning the bet.  # Flipping The Odds In His Favor  I‚Äôm not trying to take candy from a 3rd grader, I just wanted to make him more eager to do the questions. So, I tweaked the bet after he returned with the answers. Each of the 2 worksheets had 5 questions each. I decided to batch the bet as follows:  *If he gets all the questions correct, he wins.*  *If he gets all the questions in one batch correct but not the other, it‚Äôs a push.*  *If he gets less than 100% on each batch then he loses the bet.*  How did this tweak alter the proposition?  In the first bet, if he got anything wrong, he lost. With these rules, **he only loses if he gets, at least, one wrong in each batch.**  We need to analyze all the possible outcomes that can occur with 2 batches.  First, we must ask:  *What is the probability he gets all the questions right within a batch of 5 questions?*  Assume he has a 90% hit rate again.  .9‚Åµ = 59%  So for either batch he has a 59% chance of getting a perfect score and a 41% chance of getting at least one wrong (ie a non-perfect score).  Now we must consider all the possible outcomes of the proposition and their probabilities.  1) Perfect score in both batches  59% x 59% = 34.8%  2) Perfect score in one batch but not the other  59% x 41% = 24.2%  3) At least one wrong in both batches  41% x 41% = 16.8%  If we sum them all up we get 75.8%.  **Wait, these don‚Äôt add to 100%, what gives??**  We need to weigh these outcomes by the number of ways they can happen.  The possibilities with their probabilities are as follows:  * *Win, Win = 34.8%* * *Win, Lose = 24.2%* * *Lose, Win = 24.2%* * *Lose, Lose = 16.8%*  Collapsing the individual possibilities into the proposition‚Äôs probabilities we get:  * Win: 34.8% * Push: 48.4% (24.2% + 24.2%) * Lose: 16.8%  These probabilities sum to 100% and tell us:  1. The most likely scenario of the bet is a push, no money exchanged 2. Otherwise, he wins the bet 2x more than he loses the bet  This is a powerful result. Remember, his hit rate on any individual question was still 90%. By batching, we changed the proposition into a bad bet for him, into a good bet because he gets to diversify or **quarantine** the risk of a wrong answer.  # Even More Diversification  With 2 batches we saw the range of possibilities conforms to the binomial distribution for n = 2:  *p¬≤ + 2p(1-p) + (1-p)¬≤*  *where p = probability of perfect score on a batch*  *In English, the coefficients: 1 way to win both + 2 ways to push + 1 way to lose both*  What if we split the proposition into 5 batches of 2 questions each?  These are the bet scenarios:  1. *Win = 5 pairs of questions correct* 2. *Lose = at least one wrong in each of the 5 pairs to lose the bet* 3. *Push = and any other combination (i.e. 3 perfect batches + 2 imperfect batches)*  How do the batch outcomes roll up to the 3 bet scenarios?  1. We must count how many ways there are to generate each of the scenarios. 2. We must probability weight each way.  The summary table shows the work.  \[Note the coefficients correspond to the coefficients for the binomial expansion (x+y)‚Åµ which is also the row of Pascal‚Äôs Triangle for N = 5\]  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/bq641qhmst8b1.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a08fc17ce64eec2d20edd907db5f3f49b4397c2a     The net result of quarantining the questions into 5 groups of 2:  **35% chance he wins the bet**  **65% chance he pushes on the bet**  **Nearly 0% chance he loses on the bet!**  If you took this quarantining logic further and treated each question as its own bath then the new phrasing of the bet would be:  *If he gets every question correct, he wins*  *If he gets every question incorrect, he loses*  *Any other scenario is a push*  The corresponding probabilities:  Win = .9¬π‚Å∞ = 35%  Lose = .1¬π‚Å∞ = E\^(-10) or 0%  So the benefits of separating the bets were mostly achieved above when we batched into groups 5 pairs of questions.  # Conclusion  The first required my son to get a string of questions correct. Even though I estimated he had a 90% chance of getting any question correct, *by making the* ***net outcome*** *dependent on each chain-link the odds of his success became highly contingent on the length of the chain.*  With a chain length of 10, the bet was unfair to him. By changing the bet to be the result of success on smaller chains (the batches) I changed the distribution of outcome. It did not increase his chance of winning, but it reduced his chance of losing by creating offsetting scenarios or ‚Äúpushes‚Äù. In other words, the smaller chains reduced his overall risk without sacrificing his odds of winning. It was a free lunch for him.  When you create long chains of dependency (ahem, positive correlations), an impurity in any link threatens your entire proposition. In these examples, we are dealing with binary outcomes. This is a trivial analysis. With investing, the distributions of the bets are not easily known. It is well-known, however, that diversifying or not putting all your eggs in one basket is a free lunch. Still, if the investments are highly correlated, you may be fooling yourself and depending on a long chain.  Imagine if the 10 questions my son had were the type of word problem where the answer to each question is the input to the next. That‚Äôs a portfolio of highly correlated assets. If you are ‚Äúyield-farming‚Äù crypto stablecoins you have probably thought about this problem. Spreading the risk across many coins can offset many idiosyncratic risks to the protocols. But is there a translucent, hard-to-see chain of correlation tying them all together that only reveals itself when the whole background goes black? That‚Äôs systemic risk. Ultimately, the only hedge to such a risk is position sizing at the aggregate level where you sum the gross positions. This is why stress-testing a portfolio to that standard is a quant‚Äôs ‚Äúlast level of defense‚Äù.  ***Jarvis, what happens to my portfolio when all correlations go to one?***  \[If you are in the investing world you will see parallels to this lesson in the ergodicity[1](https://moontowermeta.com/i-felt-bad-for-picking-my-3rd-grader-off/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-4653) problem.\]  Oh yea, how‚Äôd the bet with my 3rd grader go?  He got a perfect score on one batch of 5, and he got 1 wrong in the second batch. So the overall bet was a push, and his old man didn‚Äôt do so bad in estimating he‚Äôd have a 90% hit rate.,;,; 2023-06-28 21:20:26]

[Tesla options mispricing or am I overlooking something important,;,; Hey All,  I'm seeing this in the tesla options.  Tesla Stock Price: 252.08 as of 12/18/2023  JAN 2025 PUT OPTION with a 250 STRIKE is 43 dollars  JAN 2025 CALL OPTION with 290 STRIKE is 43 dollars  To keep it simple, lets say I buy a 100 shares of Tesla for 25K.  I could collar it by buying the 250 put and selling a covered call at 290 with net cost of zero.  My overall downside is zero. The stock could drop 50 percent and I could still sell it for 250 in JAN 2025. My upside would be limited to (290 - 250) = \~15 percent, but getting this upside with zero downside seems almost too good to be true. Am I missing something here?,;,; 2023-12-19 03:13:23]

[Expected moves, SPY QQQ Tesla, yields.,;,; Stock futures are again lower, continuing on a theme since last Thursday. This is the 4th straight day starting in the red. Central banks are the focus this week with Jerome Powel on Capitol Hill again today while earlier, the Bank of England announced a 50 basis point raise. You're probably used to hearing the word "stubborn" inflation by now but the "stubborn" part is clearly something central banks are still trying to figure out. With other central banks taking the lead (or catching up) even while the FOMC is "pausing" treasury yields remain bid. 1-year treasury yields are now the highest they've been during this cycle. However, the 2-year yield is still lower than the level it reached prior to the Silicon Valley Bank mess (that sent yields plummeting.) Yields bottomed around the first week of May. But stocks have managed to climb alongside yields, with the SPY up 8% while the 2-year yield has climbed a full point over the past month and a half. In other words, stocks have largely shrugged off the bond market recently and don't seem overly concerned with the FOMC picking up where it left off, or keeping rates higher for longer. So far.  SPY options are pricing about a 0.4% move for today, and about a 0.6% move into tomorrow's close.

[Advice on a Tesla hedge,;,; Last week I picked up a July 21 230 call.  Tesla has been such a sick run I was riding it out.  Had a price target of 239 when I wanted to sell.  This recent run had been great and I didn‚Äôt want to sell yet but I was looking for a pullback.  Figured I would try and scalp 4 - 232.50 june 16th puts.  Picked them up close to the market close.  Now we have a crazy after hours run and I‚Äôm not sure what to do.    Any ideas would be greatly appreciated   Positions:  1 - july 21 230 call - 12.00 price   4 - June 16 232.50 puts - 6.60 price,;,; 2023-06-08 22:18:55]
[Expected moves this week. Tesla, Netflix, Schwab and more.,;,; The VIX closed 19.30 on Friday and was bid most of the day. It was higher the first two hours even while the market was up on the day, an unusual occurrence, especially on a Friday. Some of that can probably be attributed to worries about the Middle East into the weekend but out-of-the-money puts are certainly being bought as hedges, with vol below the 20 delta level now above 20IV in the next two months. Keep an eye on the VIX as it's been asleep for so long it wouldn't take much for people short vol to get caught offsides. (they also could be completely correct and the market slow grinds higher into year-end, but the point is the VIX is not "broken" and still tells a story when it gets above 20).  The expected move for this week in SPY is a bit more than 1.5%. QQQ is about 2%. 0DTE expected moves in SPY has been pretty consistently near the 0.7% range, and QQQ 0DTE expected moves have been closing in on 1% a day. That's alot more than over the Summer when SPY 0DTE expected moves were consistently below a half a percent a day.  The big story on the stock front this week is earnings, with the regional banks starting to report (as well as the rest of the big Wall Street banks, and then tech reports start to heat up, led by Netflix and Tesla this week. Expected moves based on how options closed on Friday below.

[Expected moves: Netflix, Tesla and more.,;,; The second round of big bank earnings are out with Bank of America, PNC and Morgan Stanley reporting this morning. The results have not been market-moving as of yet. MS is unched as of now, with BAC down slightly, both with moves less than options were pricing. PNC is down about 3% vs a 3.5% expected move. So the reactions are pretty muted all things considered. The broader market thinks the same, with futures all red but very slightly. Most of the bank stocks were lower over the past 3 months with the exception of JPM. JPM has also performed the best from the bank stocks that reported last week, initially giving up its earnings move gains but recovering much of them with a strong up day yesterday. Goldman reports tomorrow and then the focus shifts quickly to mega-cap tech after the bell tomorrow with Netflix and Tesla kicking things off.

[Expected moves, Carvana, Goldman, Tesla, Netflix,;,; * CARVANA SOARS * GOLDMAN DOWN  * NETFLIX, TESLA AFTER THE CLOSE  Carvana is up an unreal 35%+ this morning after surprising the market with an early earnings report and a debt restructuring plan. This obviously caught the option market completely off guard. Options were only pricing about a 10% move for the rest of this week. But this move is even way beyond what options were pricing for Carvana's assumed reporting date, where they had the expected move at about 27%. Either way, it's difficult for options traders to properly price something moving like CVNA has been lately. It's been having regular 10% type gaps/moves and on past earnings, it's regularly moved 30%+. Options can only pump up so much to account for moves like that as traders and market makers are very wary of properly pricing them (compared to how the stock is moving) and then getting stuck with all that premium when the music stops. Here's how options were priced before the surprise:  https://preview.redd.it/ikdympuvbxcb1.png?width=791&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a938d9c5a583e16395d56e787be0fc8f8820fbe8  &amp;#x200B;  Now attention turns to Netflix and Tesla who report after the close.

[Expected moves this week: Bank of America, Goldman, Netflix, Tesla and more.,;,; SPY was higher by 2.5% last week. A much larger move than options were pricing. Vol remains low across the board. To start this week the futures are pulling back a bit and with that, the VIX is starting the week off around 14 (the historical mean is around 19). This is the first full week of earnings season. Tomorrow we get a second round of big bank reports when we hear from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley (Goldman is a day later) as well as a look into online brokerage with Schwab and Interactive Brokers. On Wednesday two of the popular trading names take center stage with both Tesla and Netflix reporting after the close. We also hear from more airlines like United and get an early look at the chip sector with Taiwan Semi on Thursday. And finally a look at consumer credit and spending with American Express on Friday.  A pretty packed Tuesday through Friday so make sure to check the calendar each day. Next week things heat up even more with some mega-cap tech. On the economic front this week is lighter than the past few. We get a speech today from ECB president Lagarde, retail sales on Tuesday, and then housing data and initial jobless claims later in the week. Some expected moves for notable earnings this week.

[Expected moves: SPY, QQQ, Tesla, fed minutes and more.,;,; Stock futures are lower this morning, a slight pullback following the past week's gains. The FOMC minutes (from the June meeting) highlight the economic calendar. The market is pricing a more than 80% chance of a rate hike at the upcoming (July 25-26) meeting. There are also expectations of another hike before year-end. These minutes are closely followed by a jobs number on Friday, and a CPI release next week so some clarity on future hikes may be realized in the next week. Meanwhile, option prices are likely to see a bit of a pop this morning, both out of the quasi long holiday weekend, but also with stock futures pointing lower. The VIX printed below 13 on Friday, its lowest level in years, but it is already higher this morning, around 14.50. Again, around 19 is the historical mean so anything in this current range is historically low. However, as has been mentioned in this space before, the realized, or actual volatility of the market is in fact even lower. The SPY realized vol for the past 30 days is 10. That compares to realized vol in SPY over the past year of 19. So the low IV has been justified and will remain until something either spooks the market lower or a FOMO situation develops to the upside. SPY weekly at the money IV is about 10 (as of Friday's close) but should tick up a little bit on the down open and with FOMC minutes and NFP jobs number on Friday.   The earnings calendar remains light today but does begin to pick up after next week, when we're smack dab in earnings season again.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Movers:**   Some notable stocks making moves this morning.     * **Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +6.29%** * **Tesla Inc (TSLA) -0.79%** * **Marathon Digital Hldgs Inc (MARA) -3.13%** * **Riot Platforms Inc (RIOT) -3.75%** * **Xpeng Inc ADR (XPEV) -1.93%** * **Coinbase Global Inc Cl A (COIN) -2.84%** * **Astrazeneca Plc ADR (AZN) +2.57%** * **Wolfspeed Inc (WOLF) +18.06%** * **Mp Materials Corp (MP) +9.24%** * **Transocean Inc (RIG) +4.30%** * **Advanced Health Intelligence Ltd ADR (AHI) -8.77%** * **Hut 8 Mining Corp (HUT) -1.42%**  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**   none     Full list here: [Options AI Earnings Calendar](http://url5578.options.ai/ls/click?upn=WHju0C1BRPoBuTdL0xEcqZNWu421ak771SLA5jzpsv-2BU8w7tMzcR-2B7I-2FswbV9O3IjjJgP1PQKL9ll-2BR2phXTZw-3D-3Dg_w-_yIbKbwLGaUiHkJ2rj-2FVSLO9FkCqgwrqJUZFsR-2FM-2BW6g1NUq5hkNfzxZGFziJBIqnJxtsA-2B6Nrh8CHL3OufU5QY5TkfelaO1-2BVX2-2BiE-2FOZYaESMPanMchodgzcuMV0SgXO0AWKQd0mPpCRbCJDvN9WyFaHeFa6ySpBNBW7kreckhGxf55VjVHwQpiTeiiIfN1u3OTX-2FsJMZERz24RxbyvgDUrkLxOEN4r7l24q6GYqBSB18npoE5CJUKakp9HVfJOTWKOd28Dst9mVWdVW8ps2md2cMgJ-2FAV4iqi2rCRuaO4B7EVHHUBrDO8MX3G-2BOfRSXZXXmBWysU2QTt1RIFs18g-3D-3D)  &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar:**     * **At 10:00 AM (EST) Factory Orders MoM (May) Estimates: 0.8%, Prior: 0.4%** * **At 02:00 PM (EST) FOMC Minutes Impact: High** * **At 04:00 PM (EST) Fed Williams Speech Impact: Medium**  &amp;#x200B;  **Scanner Highlights:**   Based on the prior day's trading action.     * **Overbought (RSI):** DAL (87), LUV (83), AAL (82), JBLU (80), JETS (80), HUT (80) * **Oversold (RSI):** AZN (24), PFE (38), MU (43), MRNA (43), PENN (44), SBUX (44) * **High IV:** NKLA (+257%), RAD (+242%), LUMN (+156%), LCID (+109%), HOOD (+106%), PENN (+102%), PFE (+101%), GE (+101%), SPOT (+101%) * **Unusual Options Volume:** HOOD (+632%), CGC (+610%), RIOT (+589%), AZN (+552%), JPM (+540%), MSTR (+513%), CSCO (+500%), COIN (+461%), XPEV (+460%)  Full lists here: [Options AI Free Tools](http://url5578.options.ai/ls/click?upn=WHju0C1BRPoBuTdL0xEcqZNWu421ak771SLA5jzpsv8cedLq-2BOIzmLf53JNdlOJz0sws_yIbKbwLGaUiHkJ2rj-2FVSLO9FkCqgwrqJUZFsR-2FM-2BW6g1NUq5hkNfzxZGFziJBIqnJxtsA-2B6Nrh8CHL3OufU5QY5TkfelaO1-2BVX2-2BiE-2FOZYaESMPanMchodgzcuMV0SgXO0AWKQd0mPpCRbCJDvN9WyFaHeFa6ySpBNBW7kreckhGxf55VjVHwQpiTeiiIfN1VyDKjijw1BPB7CTozLtaRyQKXemk06YCuISpLhX25XqEyeLrvfxxSnBsRssdNgeH-2FsYXq6BQHx8Fsrv-2BzAJuifwV12lW6n25Qe-2F5YWNtC6cp3F-2FPuhYEL1-2FeI9gLsPUTgk1YohUzGqbRva7DwoiDbA-3D-3D).  &amp;#x200B;  **Chart of the Day:**  Tesla stock is up 18% in July (one trading day).

[Expected moves, Tesla, Netflix, Intuitive Surgical, Capital One and more.,;,; * Futures lower.  * QQQ -0.70%, SPY -0.25%  * Tesla and Netflix are both lower, but both within the expected move (thus far)  One of the things to look for as earnings season heats up is whether companies that miss see buyers below. We're about to get a test of underlying strength in the market with both Netflix and Tesla are lower on earnings. The two companies were the first mega-cap tech stocks to report this cycle. And most mega-cap stocks rallied into earnings season. If these companies miss, and find buyers below, the stocks will stay above their expected move levels, indicating an underlying bid in these stocks, folks that may have missed some of this rally, and now see a chance to get in. Obviously support levels are interesting spots to watch, but the options market provides another consistent one, the expected move. If the stocks continue lower, and close the day below their expected move (into earnings) it may indicate some buyer exhaustion, with buyers unwilling to step in or defend levels that were expected on a miss.  &amp;#x200B;  **Chart of the Day:**  Often, expected moves line up with recent resistance and support.

[Expected Moves: Low IV Trading and Earnings from Netflix, Tesla, Goldman, IBM and more.,;,; ## Market View  **Last Week ‚Äì Closing with a VIX Level we haven‚Äôt seen in years**  SPY finished higher by about 0.8% last week, another fairly quiet move inside what options were pricing (+/- 1.6%). The VIX was lower on the week and its closing low Friday near 17 is its lowest level since the late 2021all time market highs. The range on the week was also inside the expected move, with less than a 1.5% difference between the intra-week highs and lows. In other words, IV is low, but realized moves for the past few weeks have been even less.  **This Week ‚Äì Earnings heat up as IV cools**  SPY options are pricing just a 1.1% move for the upcoming week. That‚Äôs as low a move as we‚Äôve seen in quite some time, a factor traders need to be aware of into what could be some idiosyncratic moves in individual stocks as they begin to report. A good example came Friday as several of the large banks reported. The banking system has obviously been a focus for traders the past month, and banks giving insight in that environment would typically come in high vol environment. But because the market had stabilized since the regional bank chaos, the big banks that reported on Friday actually reported in a low IV environment. The result was two of the banks, PNC and Wells Fargo barely moving, well inside their expected moves, while the two that did see moves (JPM and Citi) nearly doubled their expected moves to the upside.  A general rule of thumb on expected moves into earnings is that a stock will stay at or inside its expected move roughly 70% of the time. But the IV backdrop does factor into those numbers. When IV is historically high, it is more likely that a stock stays within its expected move, with the moves outside expectations sometimes massive, but occurring less often. However, when the IV backdrop is low, moves outside expectations tend to happen more often, but the outsized moves themselves tend to be less massive. This makes sense intuitively. Had JPM reported in the middle of the banking turmoil of last month, and shown a net inflow of deposits from regional banks, while its IV, and the market‚Äôs overall IV had been alot higher, its move may have been even more. And that‚Äôs not just due to sentiment, although that‚Äôs a big factor, but it also has to do with the amount of short gamma that is in the market at high IV levels. High IV can create air pockets for stocks to move through. Whereas lower IV backdrops can create a long gamma backdrop, acting as a governor on moves.  The TL:DR version of that is that moves in low-vol environments are smaller overall, with less short gamma in the market. But because the expected move is so much smaller as well, moves outside expectations happen more often. The 4 banks that reported Friday are a small sample size, but the fact that two barely moved, and the other two doubled their expected move on a move that would have been considered normal just a few weeks ago, is a good illustration.  So what does that mean for trade strategies? Credit spreads create really tight windows for a stock to stay within, and it will often be self-fulfilling. The fact that the SPY‚Äôs last two weeks saw moves of just 0.4% and 0.8% is indicative of that. However, when a stock does violate that expected move, it won‚Äôt take much, and is likely to happen slightly more often. Credit Spreads should be defined risk because the premium received is not enough to make up for the fact that a % move of a couple percent could be a 4x loss. And debit spreads could look to take advantage of that as well. For instance, the likelihood of a massive move on earnings of 20% in a low IV/long gamma environment of a stock expecting a 5% move is very unlikely, however, that stock moving 6-7%, slightly beyond the expected move will happen more often. And because of that, a debit spread at the expected move could see a 3-4x return when that stock goes beyond expectations.  E.G., a stock trading $100 with a 5% expected move, the trader looking to sell premium should be very careful to define risk narrowly, perhaps a dollar wide at or beyond the expected move, so that a move to $92 or $108 (beyond the tight $95 to $105 expected move) doesn‚Äôt cause outsized losses. And on the flipside, there can be an opportunity for a long premium trader looking for a move beyond $95 or $105, with say a 105/106 call spread or a 95/94 put spread, rather than a lotto ticket call or put. The chances that the stock will make a massive move is less likely, but the chance it will move slightly beyond the move, is a slightly more frequent occurrence in low IV.  *Note, although a 17 VIX is the lowest level for the past few years, it isn‚Äôt super low historically and could just be a blip before it goes higher, or it could go much lower (mid to low teens is historically low). However, it is now lower than the historical mean, something we haven‚Äôt seen much of in recent years*.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/adnfymvpkaua1.png?width=1157&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdd4805f4f5ef9322410f18ed9dde057fca1d8db  &amp;#x200B;  **Expected Moves for This Week**¬†([via Options AI](https://tools.optionsai.com/))  * SPY¬†**1.1%** * QQQ **1.6%**¬† * IWM¬†**1.7%**  * DIA¬†**1.1%**   **Economic Calendar**  * Tuesday ‚Äì **Housing starts, Fed Speech (Bowman)** * Thursday ‚Äì **Initial jobless claims, Philly Manufacturing**  **Unusual Option Volume Thursday**  * BA, HON, NVDA, BUD, META, NFLX, SCHW  ##   ## Earnings This Week  Via the [Options AI Earnings Calendar](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings-calendar) (free to use) showing expected moves as currently priced and past moves for comparison.  ***Monday***  * **Charles Schwab SCHW ‚Äì Expected Move: 8%** \[Prior\] -3% -2% -2  ***Tuesday***  * **Bank of America BAC ‚Äì** Expected Move: 4.3% \[Prior\] +2% +6% 0% * **Goldman Sachs ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.4% \[Prior\] -6% +2% +3% * **Lockheed Martin LMT ‚Äì** Expected Move: 2.4% \[Prior\] +2% +9% +1 -2% * **Netflix NFLX** ‚Äì Expected Move: 7.4% \[Prior\] +8% +13% +7% -35% * **United Airlines UAL** ‚Äì Expected Move: 5.2% \[Prior\] -1% +5% +1% +1%  ***Wednesday***  * **Morgan Stanley MS ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.6% \[Prior\] +6% -5% 0% * **ASML Holding ASML ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.7% \[Prior\] +2% +6% +3% +3% * **Tesla TSLA ‚Äì** Expected Move: 7% \[Prior\] +11% -7% +10% +3% * **IBM IBM ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.7% \[Prior\] -5% +5% -5% +7%  ***Thursday***  * **Taiwan Semi TSM ‚Äì** Expected Move: 4.3% \[Prior\] +6% +4% +3% * **American Express AXP ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.7% \[Prior\] +10% -2% +2% -3%,;,; 2023-04-16 18:45:00]
[Expected moves, JP Morgan Citi, Wells Fargo, and a look ahead to Tesla,;,; In what is the first important look at a sector of the market during the fresh earnings season, the big bank trio of JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and Citi are all higher after reporting this morning. Blackrock is slightly lower. The other big name to report this morning, United Health is higher. As options traders, we're of course looking at more than direction. The magnitude of these moves is equally if not more important. As mentioned over the past week, we enter earnings season with some of the lowest IV we've seen in years, and expected moves for earnings the smallest we've seen in over a decade. JP Morgan options were pricing a 2.4% move, the stock is higher by 2.7% or so pre-market. Wells Fargo options were pricing about a 3% move, the stock is higher by about 3.1%. Citi options were pricing in about a 3% move and the stock is higher by about 1.6%. So options had the moves more or less correct on average, with JPM beating the expected move and Citi inside the move. As a rule of thumb about 70% of the time stocks should be at or inside the expected move on earnings. And of course, that stat is marked to the end of the day for stocks that report before the bell so the jury is still out on today. But it is something to keep a mental note of, whether we begin to see moves beyond the expected move or if options have it right, even at this low level of vol. As it could inform trade decisions, including holding positions into earnings as the vol collapse is quite different than it normally is.  Additionally, and especially as we start to hear from some tech stocks that have had a really good couple of months, are the moves to the upside the ones we see stocks beat, and are moves to the downside safer because there's an underlying bid in large parts of the market?

I sold a CSP late last year on Tesla where I place it super deep in the money at 300 strike. My cost per basis drop to 267 per share. Which i collected a $3,300 in premium.     Now I want to get rid of the 100 tesla share but not sure on how to do it. I come to two possible solution.  First, I can sell 100 shares at the 100 cover call strike that exp on Feb 23, 2024 and collect $9,954 in premium. This will off set my loss of $6,820 at which point telsa is trading at 200 per share.   \*\*\*I understand that by doing this, the person whos buying my contract at 100 per share, can openly sell those 100 shares to the open market at over $200+ per share, which will double his return. Where he can recover his $10,000 he paid me + $10,000 in profit. I will gain about  about $3,000 or so. By doing this the contract will probably be called away quickly.\*\*\*  &amp;#x200B;  Second scenario, If I sell this cover call 2years out to Jan 16, 2026 at $5 strike. I can possible collect $19,519 in premium. \*\*\*I understand  that by doing this, the person whos buying my contract at $5 per share can open sell it to the open market in 2year time, can make over $5+, which amount that is is unknown. So if tesla is trading at 300 in 2 years, they'll make $30,000. Which they will earn 3x what they paid for. But by doing this, I'll make them wait 2 years before they can close out or let it expire.\*\*\*  &amp;#x200B;  What do you guys think or what should I do.,;,; 2024-02-16 18:49:00]

[Fidelity closing Options early,;,; Two weeks ago, I had losing trades with Tesla where I had sold PUTs at 185 and bought Puts at 180 to define the risk.  Tesla was bouncing around just under 185 so I was waiting until about 1/2 hr before the market closed to make my move and was probably going to roll my trade out to the week that just ended.  When I logged on with 1/2 hr to go, I found that Fidelity had closed me out 1 full hour early.  I've asked why they did this in advance but have gotten no message back.  Is anybody aware of some rule that requires you to be out a full hour in advance if the trade is a loser?  The closeouts occurred exactly at 3PM eastern.  I can't find anything on their site that explains this.  Thanks for any help here.,;,; 2023-04-15 23:06:42]

[Strategy for selling options ?,;,; If I sell Tesla put options at 270 strike price and it did not hit 270 by the time it expired, it will be auto execised and I will need to buy 100 Tesla Shares at 270.   What would be the best case to mitigate risk ?    Should I just cut loss before it even get exercise or should I sell covered calls at maybe 275 strike price ?    My reasoning is If it hits 275, I am obligated to sell to you at 275 USD, which I make a small profit since I am buying at 270.   If it continues goes down or move sideway, I can collect my premium to narrow down the losses as well.  Is it a good strategy like should I go with selling calls if it gets exercise or should I just buyback to narrow my losses and continue to sell puts to earn back from premium,;,; 2023-06-22 07:36:15]

[TSLA,;,; Anybody looking at tesla 250 calls going into earnings?,;,; 2023-03-26 01:10:03]
[Covered Call,;,; Hi all,  I just have a quick question regarding how you could possibly lose money with covered calls.  Let's use Tesla as an example:  TSLA 10/11 Share Price: 263.00  Buy 100 shares for $26,300  Write TSLA Call 11/17 (37 days) Strike Price 285.00, 8.50  Collect $850 of premium, $850/$26,300 = 3.231% ROE for 37/365 days or 31.873% annual  If Called, TSLA &gt; $285, contract exercised, Sell 100 TSLA shares @ $285  $28,500/$26,300 = 8.365% ROE for 37/365 days or 82.5205% annual.  If OTM, TSLA &lt; $285, contract expires worthless. 0$.  T-bills are currently at 5.42% or .549% for 37/365 days.  I understand the obvious risk is that TSLA would decline in share price and would lose value that way, but why does it matter if it's a stock planned on keeping in my portfolio. If the contract isn't exercised, the contract could be written again next month for more passive income. I understand this strategy places a cap on the maximum rate of return, but for the average investor this makes way more logical sense to me than risk-free investments (t-bills, CDs, HYSA), (given they have the initial capital outlay to have 100 shares of a company within a diversified portfolio). I know that this is disregarding taxes that would lower these figures, but they would still be higher than risk-free investments.  Am I missing something or is this a passive income method logical?,;,; 2023-10-11 21:31:08]
[Debit to roll up a Covered Call?,;,; So, In January I sold Covered Calls on my Tesla shares at a strike of 135 (about 30% higher than the current price at the time). The the stock soared. I have since rolled them out and up to 140, but they are out in October now.   I've been thinking of paying a debit of $300 or so to roll them up $5 giving me a net of $200 when they are sold or if someone were to "call" them from me.   Is it worth it?  Also this is another situation I got caught in where my shares are at a large loss also, but I was using the CC strategy to generate some income at the time.  Is it worth it to do as I am considering? The paper loss would be large with the calls of course, but in time (I'm guessing a year or so) they'd be close and profits could use those paper losses.  I have considered selling a put to use the premium to pay the debit to roll the CC up.  Thoughts?,;,; 2023-07-03 13:09:03]

[Good sources of information more important than understanding technical analysis??,;,; Hello, I have been trading options for years now and I still don‚Äôt know what I am doing. We all agree that trading options is gambling. But also I realized that nowadays I spend more time doing research on Reddit or talking on online groups than doing actual technical analysis.   Most of my trades are %50 based on experience on how I know the stock has performed in the past (just fast glance without drawing lines or anything) and %50 based on what my friends on discord/reddit trade or have read and share. I keep track of all my trades and surprisingly without doing any kind of analysis I am still earning about $1000/month on average. I know it is not much but the simple fact that I am positive just by doing trades talking to people surprises me.  So I wanted to know the opinion of other traders on this. Do you do technical analysis? Which resources do you use to make your trades (which online platforms and groups do you use)?

I'm assuming this premium I have to pay is because I don't have to put up as much capital on the position, and in effect they are forcing me to pay extra money to make up for the difference in interest.  &amp;#x200B;  Yet, the theta on the puts is larger than the theta on the calls, which implies if I sell a put and buy a call, I should be making money with each day.

[Expected moves: Pepsi, Delta, JP Morgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, Amazon and more.,;,; Futures are once again bid higher. Stocks were green pre-market even before the PPI release which followed up well to yesterday's CPI, and was also cooler than expected. Both are encouraging signs about inflation. Earnings season started this morning for all intents and purposes with Pepsi and Delta Airlines being the most interesting names reporting so far. Both stocks are higher, and both have beaten their expected move slightly (so far). This is something to keep an eye on as earnings season kicks off. As mentioned yesterday, IV and expected moves in individual stocks are the lowest they've been in years. That does not mean options are completely wrong per se, vol is low for a reason across the market... But what it does mean is that individual stocks are more likely to move beyond their expected move on earnings than on average. Simply because the moves are that much smaller than typical. It also means the vol crushes after earnings are less, which may be helpful in deciding whether or not to hold positions through the event.   It's also entirely possible that any outsized moves happen more often in one direction than the other, which has more to do with the overall trend in the market. right now that trend is higher as we enter earnings so keep an eye on whether stocks beat expected moves to the upside more than the downside, or vice versa.

[CSP strategy feedback/improvements,;,; For the past 6 months or so, I have been playing with the following CSP strategy and I would like some feedback on how I can improve it or better align it with my goals in pursuing it. What got me interested in this strategy was that there was a huge spike in volatility earlier this year when SVB collapsed and I jumped in and sold some CSPs to take advantage of the opportunity.   I am writing cash secured puts on SPY 30-40 DTE targeting 0.5% of strike price and immediately placing buy orders to close them out at 40% of sell price.   For my entry points, I just kind of monitor the s&amp;p 500 and wait for a "down day". My goal is to avoid getting assigned and just collect a 5-8% yield from the premiums on top of the 4-5% yields of the core position.   My outlook is that the market will be stagnant for awhile so my goal is to squeeze additional yield by taking advantage of volatility and periodic spikes.  I originally wanted to sell covered calls on my equity portfolio on "up days" as well but the yields for CC's drop off way quicker and I would risk being called on appreciated equities .  So far since March, I have not been executed once, but my plan, if executed, is to "wheel" it out and sell covered calls at the original strike price until its called away if its within a few %. The obvious fail point of this strategy is if there is a major drop or "black swan" and my goal then will be just to wait it out.   The cash im using to execute this strategy is just a small portion of my portfolio so the worst I am doing from a risk management standpoint is exposing myself to more equity downside risk.   How "efficient" is this strategy? I haven't done much research on delta decay and other stuff so  selling at 40% or targeting 0.5% are just numbers I made up. And for all I know, this could be a totally inefficient strategy for the goal/outlook I have.   Im sticking with it for now because 5%+ yield on cash that is already earning 5% in SPAXX seems attractive at the risk level I am taking on.   How could I dial up the risk/return other than selling closer to ATM?  I have looked into a buy/write strategy but the risk profile seems more complex and I am still trying to understand how to respond to all the different scenarios.  Thanks.,;,; 2023-10-13 23:19:31]

[Quarantining Risk,;,;    In trading, ‚Äúpicking someone off‚Äù means trading against a counterparty who would flake on the price they offered you if they knew what you know.  If I lift an offer on a TSLA March call option because I‚Äôm bullish, the market-maker on the other side of my trade doesn‚Äôt care. They would still sell me the call even if I texted them my rationale. But if I had the divine knowledge that Elon was going to tweet in the next 10 seconds that earnings would be reported in March not February, then I would be knowingly ‚Äúpicking off‚Äù the market-maker. As an options trader, you need to defend against pick-offs. You also want alerts if someone else is making a price that is not incorporating material, public info. For example, if an OPEC meeting date was moved there might be a tiny window when you could disguise a calendar spread as a routine roll when really you are trying to pick off the other side before they get the memo.  \[In reality, when such news happens, market-makers will ‚Äúsweep‚Äù all the resting customer orders with price limits below or above the option‚Äôs new fair value. It‚Äôs very difficult to pick off another professional who is consuming a real-time news feed.\]  A few categories of pick-offs:  **Pickoff trades related to changes in dates.**  If earnings are moved from early Feb to early March, then the ‚Äúearnings volatility‚Äù needs to come out of the Feb expiry since you are no longer exposed to it, and the March options which now contain that volatility must appreciate relatively.  **Pickoffs related to change in carry**  If a stock announces a change in its dividend that will affect the carry embedded in the options. If a dividend is slashed, the calls go up relative to the puts. Market makers need to be on top of how corporate actions affect the inputs into their pricing models.  **Pickoffs related to changes in baskets**  If an ETF‚Äôs constituents change that affects vol of the underlying basket. If an ETF restricts creations, this can lead to the options and ETF becoming mispriced (one day I‚Äôll tell the story of how this personally cost me 6 figures).  ## Pickoffs In Real Life  The tradition of trading floors is full of insane prop betting stories (NYMEX vets have so many to choose from but my personal favorite was watching one guy successfully pound 20 Coors Lites in an hour in one of the upstairs offices).  But picking people off can be as easy as making bets with folks who are arithmetically challenged. Most people are. You only need to look up [polls](https://twitter.com/10kdiver/status/1457115978496548866?s=20) by u/10kdiver to see that even professional investors, a subset of the population who should be able to compute a return, struggle numerically.  I am overstating the case a bit.  1. I don‚Äôt know how many of those respondents are professional investors. I‚Äôd also admit there are times I‚Äôm impatient and just take a guess just to see the results. This is probably common behavior. 2. When confronted with a bet, people‚Äôs defenses go up. They are wary of strangers bearing gifts and will assume there‚Äôs a catch.  Now that was a long-winded, but hopefully fun, introduction to a story that I will improve your numerical intuition and illuminate a lesson that is central to both investing and engineering problems.  # The Proposition  My 3rd-grader came home with a packet of math worksheets from school. Two of the sheets, a total of 10 questions, were incomplete. He said the teacher didn‚Äôt require those sheets to be done.  What a bummer.  I thought they were the best questions from the whole packet. I asked him to solve the total of 10 questions but decided to make my request a little spicier. I offered him the following bet:  *If you get them all correct, I will give you $5. Otherwise, you owe me $5.*  He thought for a moment, then accepted. Before he went off to work on them, I started to wonder if my impulsive proposition was fair.  ## Is It A Fair Bet?  After eyeballing the questions, I estimated he had a 90% chance of getting any question correct. Another way to say that, is I expect he gets 1 wrong *on average*. Right off the bat, I think I‚Äôm going to win. It‚Äôs not a fair bet.  This led me to compute a couple numbers.  1) If my estimate of 90% hit rate per question is correct, what‚Äôs the chance he gets them all correct?  .90¬π‚Å∞ = 35%  That means he‚Äôs almost a 2‚Äì1 underdog  2) What would his hit rate need to be per question to make the bet fair?  First we need to convert what a fair bet means in math language. This is straightforward. Since it‚Äôs an even $5 bet then the fair proposition would not be, on average, he gets 1 wrong, but that he *gets all the questions correct 50% of the time.*  x¬π‚Å∞ = 50%  x = .50\^(1/10)  x = 93.3%  So if he had a 93.3% chance of getting any single question correct, then he has a 50% chance of winning the bet.  # Flipping The Odds In His Favor  I‚Äôm not trying to take candy from a 3rd grader, I just wanted to make him more eager to do the questions. So, I tweaked the bet after he returned with the answers. Each of the 2 worksheets had 5 questions each. I decided to batch the bet as follows:  *If he gets all the questions correct, he wins.*  *If he gets all the questions in one batch correct but not the other, it‚Äôs a push.*  *If he gets less than 100% on each batch then he loses the bet.*  How did this tweak alter the proposition?  In the first bet, if he got anything wrong, he lost. With these rules, **he only loses if he gets, at least, one wrong in each batch.**  We need to analyze all the possible outcomes that can occur with 2 batches.  First, we must ask:  *What is the probability he gets all the questions right within a batch of 5 questions?*  Assume he has a 90% hit rate again.  .9‚Åµ = 59%  So for either batch he has a 59% chance of getting a perfect score and a 41% chance of getting at least one wrong (ie a non-perfect score).  Now we must consider all the possible outcomes of the proposition and their probabilities.  1) Perfect score in both batches  59% x 59% = 34.8%  2) Perfect score in one batch but not the other  59% x 41% = 24.2%  3) At least one wrong in both batches  41% x 41% = 16.8%  If we sum them all up we get 75.8%.  **Wait, these don‚Äôt add to 100%, what gives??**  We need to weigh these outcomes by the number of ways they can happen.  The possibilities with their probabilities are as follows:  * *Win, Win = 34.8%* * *Win, Lose = 24.2%* * *Lose, Win = 24.2%* * *Lose, Lose = 16.8%*  Collapsing the individual possibilities into the proposition‚Äôs probabilities we get:  * Win: 34.8% * Push: 48.4% (24.2% + 24.2%) * Lose: 16.8%  These probabilities sum to 100% and tell us:  1. The most likely scenario of the bet is a push, no money exchanged 2. Otherwise, he wins the bet 2x more than he loses the bet  This is a powerful result. Remember, his hit rate on any individual question was still 90%. By batching, we changed the proposition into a bad bet for him, into a good bet because he gets to diversify or **quarantine** the risk of a wrong answer.  # Even More Diversification  With 2 batches we saw the range of possibilities conforms to the binomial distribution for n = 2:  *p¬≤ + 2p(1-p) + (1-p)¬≤*  *where p = probability of perfect score on a batch*  *In English, the coefficients: 1 way to win both + 2 ways to push + 1 way to lose both*  What if we split the proposition into 5 batches of 2 questions each?  These are the bet scenarios:  1. *Win = 5 pairs of questions correct* 2. *Lose = at least one wrong in each of the 5 pairs to lose the bet* 3. *Push = and any other combination (i.e. 3 perfect batches + 2 imperfect batches)*  How do the batch outcomes roll up to the 3 bet scenarios?  1. We must count how many ways there are to generate each of the scenarios. 2. We must probability weight each way.  The summary table shows the work.  \[Note the coefficients correspond to the coefficients for the binomial expansion (x+y)‚Åµ which is also the row of Pascal‚Äôs Triangle for N = 5\]  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/bq641qhmst8b1.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a08fc17ce64eec2d20edd907db5f3f49b4397c2a     The net result of quarantining the questions into 5 groups of 2:  **35% chance he wins the bet**  **65% chance he pushes on the bet**  **Nearly 0% chance he loses on the bet!**  If you took this quarantining logic further and treated each question as its own bath then the new phrasing of the bet would be:  *If he gets every question correct, he wins*  *If he gets every question incorrect, he loses*  *Any other scenario is a push*  The corresponding probabilities:  Win = .9¬π‚Å∞ = 35%  Lose = .1¬π‚Å∞ = E\^(-10) or 0%  So the benefits of separating the bets were mostly achieved above when we batched into groups 5 pairs of questions.  # Conclusion  The first required my son to get a string of questions correct. Even though I estimated he had a 90% chance of getting any question correct, *by making the* ***net outcome*** *dependent on each chain-link the odds of his success became highly contingent on the length of the chain.*  With a chain length of 10, the bet was unfair to him. By changing the bet to be the result of success on smaller chains (the batches) I changed the distribution of outcome. It did not increase his chance of winning, but it reduced his chance of losing by creating offsetting scenarios or ‚Äúpushes‚Äù. In other words, the smaller chains reduced his overall risk without sacrificing his odds of winning. It was a free lunch for him.  When you create long chains of dependency (ahem, positive correlations), an impurity in any link threatens your entire proposition. In these examples, we are dealing with binary outcomes. This is a trivial analysis. With investing, the distributions of the bets are not easily known. It is well-known, however, that diversifying or not putting all your eggs in one basket is a free lunch. Still, if the investments are highly correlated, you may be fooling yourself and depending on a long chain.  Imagine if the 10 questions my son had were the type of word problem where the answer to each question is the input to the next. That‚Äôs a portfolio of highly correlated assets. If you are ‚Äúyield-farming‚Äù crypto stablecoins you have probably thought about this problem. Spreading the risk across many coins can offset many idiosyncratic risks to the protocols. But is there a translucent, hard-to-see chain of correlation tying them all together that only reveals itself when the whole background goes black? That‚Äôs systemic risk. Ultimately, the only hedge to such a risk is position sizing at the aggregate level where you sum the gross positions. This is why stress-testing a portfolio to that standard is a quant‚Äôs ‚Äúlast level of defense‚Äù.  ***Jarvis, what happens to my portfolio when all correlations go to one?***  \[If you are in the investing world you will see parallels to this lesson in the ergodicity[1](https://moontowermeta.com/i-felt-bad-for-picking-my-3rd-grader-off/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-4653) problem.\]  Oh yea, how‚Äôd the bet with my 3rd grader go?  He got a perfect score on one batch of 5, and he got 1 wrong in the second batch. So the overall bet was a push, and his old man didn‚Äôt do so bad in estimating he‚Äôd have a 90% hit rate.,;,; 2023-06-28 21:20:26]

[From CAPM To Hedging,;,; \[This post uses stats 101 but can be approached with little math knowledge because it moves slowly...it builds to a set of tools for determining your hedge ratios for paired trades and aggregating deltas across an entire portfolio if you want to hedge the systemic risk with a benchmark future like ES\]  &amp;#x200B;   Let‚Äôs start with a question from Twitter via  patrick\_oshag   *If you had to our your whole net worth into a single company right now (public or private), what would you pick?   Berkshire Hathaway is not allowed as an answer*      This is a provocative question. Patrick was clever to disallow Berkshire. In this post, we are going to use this question to launch into the basics of regression, correlation, beta hedging and risk.  Let‚Äôs begin.  ## My Reaction To The Questionüì∑  I don‚Äôt know anything about picking stocks. I do know about the nature of stocks which makes this question scary. Why?  1. Stocks don‚Äôt last foreverMany stocks go to zero. The distribution of many stocks is positively skewed which means there‚Äôs a small chance of them going to the moon and reasonable chance that they go belly-up. The price of a stock reflects its mathematical expectation. Since the downside is bounded by zero and the upside is infinite, for the expectation to balance the probability of the stock going down can be much higher than our flawed memories would guess. Stock indices automatically rebalance, shedding companies that lose relevance and value. So the idea that stocks up over time is really stock *indices* go up over a time, even though individual stocks have a nasty habit of going to zero. For more see [*Is There Actually An Equity Premium Puzzle?*](https://moontowermeta.com/is-there-actually-an-equity-premium-puzzle/). 2. Diversification is the only free lunchThe first point hinted at my concern with the question. I want to be diversified. Markets do not pay you for non-systematic risk. In other words, you do not get paid for risks that you can hedge. All but the most fundamental risks can be hedged with diversification. See [*Why You Don‚Äôt Get Paid For Diversifiable Risks*](https://moontowermeta.com/why-you-dont-get-paid-for-diversifiable-risks/). To understand how diversifiable risks get arbed out of the market ask yourself who the most efficient holder of a particular idiosyncratic risk is? If it‚Äôs not you, then you are being outbid by someone else, or you‚Äôre holding the risk at a price that doesn‚Äôt make sense given your portfolio choices. Read [*You Don‚Äôt See The Whole Picture*](https://moontowermeta.com/you-dont-see-the-whole-picture/) to see why.  My concerns reveal why Berkshire would be an obvious choice. Patrick ruled it out to make the question much harder. Berkshire is a giant conglomerate. Many would have chosen it because it‚Äôs run by masterful investors Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger. But I would have chosen it because it‚Äôs diversified. It is one of the closest companies I could find to an equity index. Many people look at the question and think about where their return is going to be highest. I have no edge in that game. Instead, I want to minimize my risk by diversifying and accepting the market‚Äôs compensation for accepting broad equity exposure.  In a sense, this question reminds me of an interview question I‚Äôve heard.  *You are gifted $1,000,000 dollars. You must put it all in play on a roulette wheel. What do you do?*  The roulette wheel has negative edge no matter what you do. Your betting strategy can only alter the distribution. You can be crazy and bet it all on one number. Your expectancy is negative but the payoff is positively skewed‚Ä¶you probably lose your money but have a tiny chance at becoming super-rich. You can try to play it safe by risking your money on most of the numbers, but that is still negative expectancy. The skew flips to negative. You probably win, but there‚Äôs a small chance of losing most of your gifted cash.  I would choose what‚Äôs known as a *minimax* strategy which seeks to minimize the maximum loss. I would spread my money evenly on all the numbers, accept a sure loss of 5.26%.[1](https://moontowermeta.com/from-capm-to-hedging/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-5236) The minimax response to Patrick‚Äôs question is to find the stock that is the most internally diversified.  ## Berkshire Vs The Marketüì∑  I don‚Äôt have an answer to Patrick‚Äôs question. Feel free to explore the speculative responses in the thread. Instead, I want to dive further into my gut reaction that Berkshire would be a reasonable proxy to the market. If we look at the mean of its [annual returns](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2021ltr.pdf) from 1965 to 2001, the numbers are gaudy. Its CAGR was 26.6% vs the SP500 at 11%. Different era. Finding opportunities at the scale Buffet needs to move the needle has been much harder in the past 2 decades.¬†  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/zfqfg4c8zy8b1.png?width=253&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1b304927889c03d6e33536fd2480921543fec73  &amp;#x200B;     Buffet has been human for the past 20 years. This is a safer assumption than the hero stats he was putting up in the last half of the 20th century.¬†  The mean arithmetic returns and standard deviations validate my hunch that Berkshire‚Äôs size and diversification [2](https://moontowermeta.com/from-capm-to-hedging/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-5236) make it behave like the whole market in a single stock.¬†  Let‚Äôs add a scatterplot with a regression.¬†  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ct6ujfx9zy8b1.png?width=675&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68d17d0dd8275d198ca3197bb624c98afe1a9a6b     f you tried to anticipate Berkshire‚Äôs return, your best guess might be its past 20 year return, distributed similarly to its prior volatility. Another approach would be to see this relationship to the SP500 and notice that a portion of its return can simply be explained by the market. It clearly has a positive correlation to the SP500. But just how much of the relationship is explained by SP500? This is a large question with practical applications. Specifically, it underpins how market netural traders think about hedges. If I hedge an exposure to Y with X how much risk do I have remaining? To answer this question we will go on a little learning journey:  1. Deriving sensitivities from regressions in general 2. Interpreting the regression 3. CAPM: Applying regression to compute the ‚Äúrisk remaining of a hedge‚Äù  On this journey you can expect to learn the difference between beta and correlation, build intuition for how regressions work, and see how market exposures are hedged.¬†  ## Unpacking The Berkshire Vs SP500 Regressionüì∑  A regression is simply a model of how an independent variable influences a dependant variable. Use a regression when you believe there is a causal relationship between 2 variables. Spurious correlations are correlations that will appear to be causal because they can be tight. The regression math may even suggest that‚Äôs the case. I‚Äôm sorry. Math is a just a tool. It requires judgement. The sheer number of measurable quanitites in the world guarantees an infinite list of correlations that serve as humor not insight[3](https://moontowermeta.com/from-capm-to-hedging/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-5236).  The SP500 is steered by the corporate earnings of the largest public companies (and in the long-run the Main Street economy[4](https://moontowermeta.com/from-capm-to-hedging/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-5236)) discounted by some risk-aware consensus. Berkshire is big and broad enough to inherit the same drivers. We accept that Berkshire‚Äôs returns are partly driven by the market and partly due to its own idiosyncracies.  Satisfied that some of Berkshire‚Äôs returns are attributable to the broader market, we can use regression to understand the relationship. In the figure above, I had Excel simply draw a line that best fit the scatterplot with SP500 being the independent variable, or X, and Berkshire returns being the dependant or Y. The best fit line (there are many kinds of regression but we are using a simple linear regression) is defined the same way in line is: by a slope and an intercept.¬†  The regression equation should remind you of the generic form of a line y = mx + b where m is the slope and b is the intercept.¬†  In a regression:  **y=Œ±+Œ≤x**  where:  y = dependant variable (Berkshire returns)  x = independent variable (SP500 returns)  Œ± = the intercept (a constant)  Œ≤ = the slope or sensitivity of the Y variable based on the X variable  If you right-click on a scatterplot in Excel you can choose ‚ÄúAdd Trendline‚Äù. It will open the below menu where you can set the fitted line to be linear and also check a box to ‚ÄúDisplay Equation on chart‚Äù.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/zqi7y5wbzy8b1.png?width=275&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddceb144a7c583bcd5e7416c8124a90044cce499     This is how I found the slope and intercept for the Berkshire chart:  y = .6814x + .0307  Suppose the market returns 2%:  Predicted Berkshire return = .6814 \* 2% + 3.07%  Predicted Berkshire return = 4.43%  So based on actual data, we built a simple model of Berkshire‚Äôs returns as a function of the market.¬†  It‚Äôs worth slowing down to understand how this line is being created. Conceptually it is the line that minimizes the squared errors between itself and the actual data. Since each point has 2 coordinates, we are dealing with the variance of a joint distribution. We use covariance instead of variance but the concepts are analogous. With variance we square the deviations from a mean. For covariance, we multiply the distance of each X and Y in a coordinate from their respective means: **(x·µ¢ ‚Äì xÃÑ)(y·µ¢ -yÃÑ)**  Armed with that idea, we can compute the regression line by hand with the following formulas:  **Œ≤ or slope = covar(x,y)/ var(x)**  **Œ± or intercept = yÃÑ ‚Äì Œ≤ÃÑxÃÑ**  We will look at the full table of this computation later to verify Excel‚Äôs regression line. Before we do that, let‚Äôs make sure that this model is even helpful. One standard we could use to determine¬† if the model is useful is if it performs better than the cheapest naive model that says:  Our predicted Berkshire return simply is mean return from sample.  This green arrows in this picture represent the error between this simple model and the actual returns.¬†  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/as1p2cjdzy8b1.png?width=708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e2b9cb1add48164c95ff5e3e6df447c339148d5     This naive model of summing the squared differences from the mean of Berkshire‚Äôs returns is exactly the same as variance. You are computing squared differences from a mean. If you take square root of the average of the squared differences you get a standard deviation. In, this simple model where our prediction is simply the mean our volatility is 16.5% or the volatility of Berkshire‚Äôs returns for 20 years.¬†  In the regression context, the total variance of the dependent variable from its mean is knows as the **Total Sum of Squares** or **TSS**.¬†  The point of using regression though is we can make a better prediction of Berkshire‚Äôs returns if we know the SP500‚Äôs returns. So we can compare the mean to the fitted line instead of the actual returns. The sum of those squared differences is known as the **Regression Sum Of Squares** or **RSS**. This is the sum of squared deviations between the mean and fitted predictions instead of the actual returns. If there is tremendous overlap between the RSS and TSS, than we think much of the variance in X explains the variance of Y.  The last quantity we can look at is the **Error Sum of Squares** or **ESS**. These are the deviations from the actual data to the predicted values represented by our fitted line. This represents the unexplained portion of Y‚Äôs variance.¬†  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/1rffmi3fzy8b1.png?width=707&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30b052be4c4675c1ed2b15eb13c0048adb100960     Let‚Äôs use 2008‚Äôs giant negative return to show how TSS, RSS, and ESS relate.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/qa0wf9hgzy8b1.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f243231dd10421f7ead8914e2536309ea0520cd0     The visual shows:  **TSS = RSS + ESS**  We can compute the sum of these squared deviations simply from their definitions:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/l4qfntajzy8b1.png?width=622&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5330715f05b291ae494034c65e747e19c43e0359     The only other quantities we need are variances and covariances to compute Œ≤ or slope of the regression line.¬†  In the table below:  ≈∑ = the predicted value of Berkshire‚Äôs return aka ‚Äúy-hat‚Äù  xÃÑ = mean SP500 return aka ‚Äúx-bar‚Äù  yÃÑ = mean Berkshire return aka ‚Äúy-bar‚Äù  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/hg9cedokzy8b1.png?width=756&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17001f458cb11098cb00ee07cf923e9a98678aa0  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/99jjjwhlzy8b1.png?width=181&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df7449fe7c2caa4cd87ad3b14993a1864b441b5b     ¬† **Œ≤ = .40 / .59 = .6814**  ¬† **Œ± = yÃÑ ‚Äì Œ≤ÃÑxÃÑ = 10.6% ‚Äì .6814 \* 11.1% = 3.07%**  This yields the same regression equation Excel spit out:  **y=Œ±+Œ≤x**  **≈∑ = 3.07% + .6814x**  ## R-Squaredüì∑  We walked through this slowly as a learning exercise, but the payoff is appreciating the R¬≤. Excel computed it as 52%. But we did everything we need to compute it by hand. Go back to our different sum of squares.  TSS or variance of Y = .52  ESS or sum of squared difference between actual data and the model = .25  Re-arranging TSS = RSS + ESS we can see that RSS = .27  Which brings us to:  **R¬≤ = RSS/TSS = .27/.52 = 52%**¬†  Same as Excel!  R¬≤ is the regression sum of squares divided by the total variance of Y. It is called the *coefficient of determination* and can be interpreted as:  **The variability in Y explained by X**  So based on this small sample, 52% of Berkshire‚Äôs variance is explained by the market, as proxied by the SP500.¬†  ## Correlationüì∑  Correlation, r (or if you prefer Greek, œÅ) can be computed in at least 2 ways. It‚Äôs the square root of R¬≤.  **r = ‚àöR¬≤ = ‚àö.52 = .72**  We can confirm this by computing correlation by hand according to its own formula:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/30x0p5dozy8b1.png?width=177&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1aaf9777579657db3fddc98882675a225a8b195   Substituting:   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/nj1smpmpzy8b1.png?width=346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72c8a205d29e0c6fac9a4dd92fbd1e11e46afda1     Looking at the table above we have all the inputs:  **r = .40 / sqrt(.59 x .52)**  **r = .72**  Variance is an unintuitive number. By taking the square root of variance, we arrive at a standard deviation which we can actually use.  Similarly, covariance is an intermediate computation lacking intuition. By normalizing it (ie dividing it) by the standard deviations of X and Y we arrive at correlation, a measure that holds meaning to us. It is bounded by -1 and +1. If the correlation is .72 then we can make the following statement:  ***If x is 1 standard deviation above its mean, I expect y to be .72 standard deviations above its own mean.***  It is a normalized measure of how one variable co-varies versus the other.¬†  ## How Beta And Correlation Relateüì∑  Beta, Œ≤, is the slope of the regression equation.  Correlation is the square root of R2 or coefficient of determination.  Beta actually embeds correlation within it.  Look closely at the formulas:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/p856tajrzy8b1.png?width=181&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=55323785b1d75418a81117bf950309636bc70167  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/wylxthkszy8b1.png?width=177&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34028ed71ea1d95233a7fcb4a02e020d603432b9     Watch what happens when we divide **Œ≤ÃÑ by r.**  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/knp9i20uzy8b1.png?width=288&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef35e10ac15500ee5ceae8e3213705d1653fcb07     Whoa.  ***Beta equals correlation times the ratio of the standard deviations.***¬†  The significance of that insight is about to become clear as we move from our general use of regression to the familiar CAPM regression. From the CAPM formula we can derive the basis of hedge ratios and more!  We have done all the heavy lifting at this point. The reward will be a set of simple, handy formulas that have served me throughout my trading career.  Let‚Äôs continue.  ## From Regression To CAPM¬†üì∑  The famous CAPM pricing equation is a simple linear regression stipulating that the return of an asset is a function of the risk free rate, a beta to the broader market, plus an error term that represents the security‚Äôs own idiosyncratic risk.¬†  **R·µ¢ = R’¢ + Œ≤(R‚Çò ‚Äì R’¢) + E·µ¢**  where:  R·µ¢ = security total return  R’¢ = risk-free rate  Œ≤ = sensitivity of security‚Äôs return to the overall market‚Äôs excess return (ie the return above the risk-free rate)  E·µ¢ = the security‚Äôs unique return (aka the error or noise term)  Since the risk-free rate is a constant, let‚Äôs scrap it to clean the equation up.     This is the variance equation for this security:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/p15vxy1yzy8b1.png?width=297&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7077da159beb29c4c4ceb4f97430c1b2d9dd18ed     Recall that beta is the vol ratio \* correlation:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/sqvzjrlzzy8b1.png?width=230&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3925e6c866d014667c5ea5fe2a2683940b634a3f     We can use this to factor the ‚Äúmarket variance‚Äù term.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ri8tf2610z8b1.png?width=347&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4109cbe01562c41c239e5dc15b37301f125fec89     Plugging this form of ‚Äúvariance due to the market‚Äù back into the variance equation:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/i2p7qsn20z8b1.png?width=361&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=860604ff025999eca2a708eabbe01010faafec7d     This reduces to the prized equation: The ‚Äúrisk remaining‚Äù formula which is the proportion of a stock‚Äôs volatility due to its own idiosyncratic risk.¬†  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/92tpep840z8b1.png?width=366&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b171be3eb8e57a3fbaf2fb8571031d8e066a12d9     This makes sense. R2 is the amount of variance in a dependant variable attributable to indepedent variable. If we subtract that proportion from 1 we arrive at the ‚Äúunexplained‚Äù or idiosyncratic variance. By taking the square root of that quantity, we are left with unexplained volatility or ‚Äúrisk remaining‚Äù.¬†  Let‚Äôs use what we‚Äôve learned in a concrete example.  ## From CAPM To Hedge Ratiosüì∑  Let‚Äôs return to Berkshire vs the SP500. Suppose we are long $10mm worth of BRK.B and want to hedge our exposure by going short SP500 futures.¬†  We want to compute:  1. How many dollars worth of SP500 to get short 2. The ‚Äúrisk remaining‚Äù on the hedged portfolio  **How many dollars of SP500 do we need to short?**     Before we answer this lets consider a few ways we can hedge with SP500.¬†  * *Dollar weighting*   We could simply sell $10mm worth of SP500 futures which corresponds to our $10mm long in BRK.B. Since Berkshire and the SP500 are a similar volatility this is a reasonable approach. But suppose we were long TSLA instead of BRK.B. Assuming TSLA was sufficiently correlated to the market (say .70 like BRK.B), the SP500 hedge would be ‚Äútoo light‚Äù.¬†   Why?¬†   Because TSLA is about 3x more volatile than the SP500. If the SP500 fell 1 standard deviation, we expect TSLA to fall .70 standard deviations. Since TSLA‚Äôs standard deviations are much larger than the SP500 we would be tragically underhedged. Our TSLA long would lose much more money than our short SP500 position because we are not short enough dollars of SP500.¬†    * *Vol weighting*   Dollar weighting is clearly naive if there are large differences in volatility between our long and short. Let‚Äôs stick with the TSLA example. If TSLA is 3x as volatile as the SP500 then if we are long $10mm TSLA, we need to short $30mm worth of SP500.   Uh oh.¬†   That‚Äôs going to be too much. Remember the correlation. It‚Äôs only .70. The pure vol weighted hedge only makes sense if the correlations are 1. If the SP500 drops one standard deviation, we expect TSLA to drop only .70 standard deviations, not a full standard deviation. In this case, we will have made too much money on our hedge, but if the market would have rallied 1 standard deviation our oversized short would have been ‚Äúheavy‚Äù. We would lose more money than we gained on our TSLA long. Again, only partially hedged.¬†    * *Beta weighting*   Alas, we arrive at the goldilocks solution. We use the beta or slope of the linear regression to weight our hedge. Since beta equals correlation \* vol ratio we are incorporating both vol and correlation weighting into our hedge!¬†   I made up numbers vols and correlations to complete the summary tables below. The key is seeing how much the prescribed hedge ratios can vary depending on how you weight the trades.¬†       https://preview.redd.it/p8ujhzo60z8b1.png?width=537&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf5cf8298fa8153b1fce52979fb8a762d44418e8     * Beta weighting accounts for both relative volatilies and the correlation between names. Beta has a one-to-many relationship to its construction. A beta of .5 can come from:       * A .50 correlation but equal vols    * A .90 correlation but vol ratio of .56    * A .25 correlation but vol ratio of 2  It‚Äôs important to decompose betas because the correlation portion is what determines the ‚Äúrisk remaining‚Äù on a hedge. Let‚Äôs take a look.¬†  **How much risk remains on our hedges?**  We are long $10,000,000 of TSLA  We sell $21,000,000 of SP500 futures as a beta-weighted hedge.¬†  Risk remaining is the volatility of TSLA that is unexplained by the market.  * R2 is the amount of variance in the TSLA position explained by the market.¬† * 1-R2 is the amount of variance that remains unexplained * The vol remaining is sqrt(1-R2)  Risk (or vol) remaining = sqrt (1-.72) = 51%  TSLA annual volatility is 45% so the risk remaining is 51% \* 45% = 22.95%  22.95% of $10,0000 of TSLA = $2,295,000  So if you ran a hedged position, within 1 standard deviation, you still expect $2,295,000 worth of noise!  Remember correlation is symmetrical. The correlation of A to B is the same as the correlation of B to A (you can confirm this by looking at the formula).¬†  **Beta is not symmetrical because it‚Äôs correlation \* œÉdependant /** **œÉindependent**¬†  Yet risk remaining only depends on correlation.¬†  So what happens if we flipped the problem and tried to hedge $10,000,000 worth of SP500 with a short TSLA position.  1. First, this is conceptually a more dangerous idea. Even though the correlation is .70, we are less likely to believe that TSLA‚Äôs variance explains the SP500‚Äôs variance. Math without judgement will impale you on a spear of overconfidence.¬†    2. I‚Äôll work through the example just to be complete.¬†   To compute beta we flip the vol ratio from 3 to 1/3 then multiply by the correlation of .7   Beta of SP500 to TSLA is .333 \* .7 = .233   If we are long $10,000,000 of SP500, we sell $2,333,000 of TSLA. The risk remaining is still 51% but it is applied to the SP500 volatility of 15%.¬†   51% x 15% = 7.65% so we expect 7.65% of $10,000,000 or $765,000 of the SP500 position to be unexplained by TSLA.¬†    3. I‚Äôm re-emphasizing: math without judgement is a recipe for disaster. The formulas are tools, not substitutes for reasoning.¬†  **Changes in Correlation Have Non-Linear Effects On Your Risk**  Hedging is tricky. You can see that risk remaining explodes rapidly as correlation falls.  ***If correlation is as high as .86, you already have 50% risk remaining!***     In practice, a market maker may:  1. group exposures to the most related index (they might have NDX, SPX, and IWM buckets for example) 2. offset deltas between exposures as they accumulate 3. and hedge the remaining deltas with futures.¬†  You might create risk tolerances that stop you from say being long $50mm worth of SPX and short $50mm of NDX leaving you exposed the underlying factors which differentiate these indices. Even though they might be tightly correlated intraday, the correlation change over time and your risk-remaining can begin to swamp your edge.¬†     The point of hedging is to neutralize the risks you are not paid to take. But hedging is costly. Traders must always balance these trade-offs in the context of their capital, risk tolerances, and changing correlations.¬†  ## Reviewüì∑  I walked slowly through topics that are familiar to many investors and traders. I did this because the grout in these ideas often trigger an insight or newfound clarity of something we thought we understood.¬†  This is a recap of important ideas in this post:  * Variance is a measure of dispersion for a single distribution. Covariance is a measure of dispersion for a joint distribution. * Just as we take the square root of variance to normalize it to something useful (standard deviation, or in a finance context ‚Äî volatility), we normalize covariance into correlation. * Intuition for a positive(negative) correlation: if X is N standard deviations above its mean, Y is r \* N standard deviations above(below) its mean.¬† * Beta is r \* the vol ratio of Y to X. In a finance context, it allows it allows us to convert a correlation from a standard deviation comparison to a simple elasticity. If beta = 1.5, then if X is up 2%, I expect Y to be up 3% * Correlation is symmetrical. Beta is not.¬† * R2¬†is the variance explained by the independent variable. Risk remaining is the volatility that remains unexplained. It is equal to¬†sqrt(1-R2).¬† * There is a surprising amount of risk remaining even if correlations are strong. At a correlation of .86, there is 50% unexplained variance! * Don‚Äôt compute robotically. Reason &gt; formulas.¬†  Beware.  Least squares linear regression is only one method for fitting a line. It only works for linear relationships. Its application is fraught with pitfalls. It‚Äôs important to understand the assumptions in any models you use before they become load-bearing beams in your process.¬†,;,; 2023-06-29 14:54:29]

[Playing the Long Game with Fisker (FSR): Embracing Risk in the EV Sector,;,; I have a soft spot for Fisker. It's a common desire to want to see the ambitious plans of this electric vehicle manufacturer come to fruition, and I confess that my sentiments are not out of the ordinary in this regard.  Today's report isn't bad, but from an investor's standpoint, it indicates that the soft spot in my heart represents a rather high-risk venture. Still, there's no shortage of individuals who relish the opportunity to invest in stocks with such explosive growth potential. It's to these people that I sold 40 September calls at a strike price of $10. And, as per usual, I picked up 10 shares myself at a strike price of $7.  I've garnered a credit of $99.  The volume is modest, and the collateral needed is minimal - less than $3k. Yet, for some reason, this trade has me feeling slightly on edge, as FSR could take off rather abruptly.  Of course, I anticipate making a few more hundred even with this volume.   https://preview.redd.it/86h7bchjr4gb1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e71907ded2f55a89b9855df47ef7af3ab20bf906,;,; 2023-08-04 17:44:41]

[OTM Call Optimal Strike Price,;,; This is a simulated trade only.   However, I noticed that the leverage effect for the strike price at 250 is the greatest.   I bought calls when the share is around $120. Why didn't the far out OTM call give the highest leverage in this case? Is it to assume that the return is the highest, if the share price is closest to the strike price of the call, in this case 250? I always thought the deep OTM call could give the highest return if the stock goes in the right direction. It doesn't look like that though. What am I missing here?

[Expected moves today, Powell, SPY, VIX,;,; Futures are lower for a 3rd straight day as the market waits for Fed Chair Powell's testimony in front of Congress. Some of his prepared remarks were released before the bell. The 3 day losing streak hasn't added up to much of a sell-off as of yet. The SPY is lower by about 1.5% since an intra-week high last Thursday. Nor has it affected vol much, the VIX is even lower than it was during that Thursday high in stocks.   As mentioned alot recently, yes vol is low, but the moves in the market are also very muted. The realized vol in SPY over the past month now sits at 12. Options in SPY are about 11 vol for the upcoming few weeks. In other words, IV is currently reflective of how the market is moving. Therefore option buyers are still having to get direction correct and be very nimble, despite how "cheap" vol is. Short-term option trading is basically a battle between implied vol, and realized vol. The mean reversion of IV (buying low IV, selling high IV) typically needs more time to play out. Speaking of that, when vol is this low for this long it's sometimes helpful to begin to look out a few months and see how low IV has been dragged down by what's happening recently. A look at SPY vol out in November and December shows at-the-money vol around 15-16. To put that in perspective, that's both below historical averages for IV, but it's also much lower than the realized vol if SPY over the past year, which is around 20, even with the slow grind of the past few months.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Action:**  * Tesla Inc (TSLA) +0.54% * Marathon Digital Hldgs Inc (MARA) +5.38% * Riot Platforms Inc (RIOT) +3.82% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +0.96% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.66% * Coinbase Global Inc Cl A (COIN) +2.89% * Opendoor Technologies Inc (OPEN) +4.23% * Alibaba Group Holding ADR (BABA) -0.65% * Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) +0.24% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.33% * Carvana Company Cl A (CVNA) +0.55% * Li Auto Inc ADR (LI) +3.14% * C3.Ai Inc Cl A (AI) -0.76%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * KB Home (KBH) Expected Move: 7.97% * Winnebago Industries, Inc.

[Nvidia Expected Move / Earnings Preview,;,; Stocks begin the day slightly in the green but there are some wild swings in companies that just reported. With PTON down 30%, Foot Locker down 30%, and Abercrombie up 15%. Those were all significantly larger moves than options were pricing.  Of course, the big event of the day is Nvidia NVDA earnings after the close. At the moment, options are pricing about a 9.5% move. Recent earnings have seen actual moves of +25%, +14%, -1%, and +4%. In other words, options are pricing a smaller move than the past two events, which have both seen significantly larger moves. Options expiring Friday have implied vol of about 134, while 30-day IV is around 66.  Since that +25% earnings move in May the stock has remained volatile, but with a 16-17% range since early June. The stock is just shy of its all-time high, with the upper expected move around the big round number of $500, while the lower expected move sits at levels where the stock has bounced twice this summer:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/97hfkzpy4vjb1.png?width=813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ead1c5ab30f70c6dff2decb0653b065f7819c3a6  In other words, options sellers would be hoping the stock held that support if the company disappoints, and found sellers at a big fat number of $500, which would be a new all-time high. One thing to look for in situations like that is if there's open the interest around a round number like $500. And in this case, there is, with the 500 line having significantly more open interest than anything around it, with similar open interest as the near-the-money 450 strike:  https://preview.redd.it/tu1g15xd6vjb1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daf65faf582d3d0429219727507cdb0f1db4feee  That's not a ton to rest your hat on as resistance, but it's something, potential gamma. Therefore, the expected move levels have some reasoning behind them at the moment and may help explain why the expected move is so much less than the past two events. Option buyers of course should be aware of those levels and perhaps look to debit spread to those levels.  As far as how the stock has been moving recently, it's been volatile, but the 30 day actual vol of 49 is in line with how the stock has moved the past year. So it's NVDA being NVDA.  **Early Movers:**  * AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC) -21.96% * Peloton Interactive Inc (PTON) -29.90% * Footlocker Inc (FL) -30.04% * Tesla Inc (TSLA) -2.31% * Vci Global Limited Ordinary Share (VCIG) +50.67% * Grab Holdings Ltd Cl A (GRAB) +7.78% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) +0.64% * Apellis Pharmaceuticals Inc (APLS) +26.69% * Iteos Therapeutics Inc (ITOS) +36.85% * Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Company (ANF) +15.35% * Analog Devices (ADI) -4.91% * Nike Inc (NKE) -3.78%  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * **NVIDIA** Corporation (NVDA) Expected Move: **9.31%** * **Snowflake Inc.** (SNOW) Expected Move\*\*: 9.44%\*\* * **Autodesk, Inc.** (ADSK) Expected Move: **5.50%** * **Splunk Inc.** (SPLK) Expected Move: **7.40%** * **NetApp, Inc.** (NTAP) Expected Move: **5.70%** * **Ooma, Inc.** (OOMA) Expected Move: **12.27%**  Full list here: [Options AI Earnings Calendar](http://url5578.options.ai/ls/click?upn=WHju0C1BRPoBuTdL0xEcqZNWu421ak771SLA5jzpsv-2BU8w7tMzcR-2B7I-2FswbV9O3IYMqc0knxD4ENs73FR4K1Rr1Fgo-2FwqDyknm-2B4c-2BQ3V4z9wDW6qmNOwlJCZ6dYTvPyTvoqTC1ZPUKTebNvybVjcp-2BFmPfz2l3b0-2FKclxDdYL4-3D3e6L_yIbKbwLGaUiHkJ2rj-2FVSLO9FkCqgwrqJUZFsR-2FM-2BW6g1NUq5hkNfzxZGFziJBIqnJxtsA-2B6Nrh8CHL3OufU5QY5TkfelaO1-2BVX2-2BiE-2FOZYaESMPanMchodgzcuMV0SgXO0AWKQd0mPpCRbCJDvN9W0Trhd5va2JQLYW2hN32pQ2-2BO5xRqnabuTXsdJ5nBsD9PcFHvPn2oIo6tLZ7Hdc0KItR4DlJVGilbSUkQi4vXiMAxQNZ2f1UzEXyfuukq28-2FIvYVt2ujM8tFJSHheWNpVDkV07v-2FV5lhL0nJINjlnhCFdmev-2BbDDobkTCZysOhDBMr8Xp2z9bvuD-2FE9QP0JCOA-3D-3D)  **Today's Economic Data:**  * At 09:45 AM (EST) S&amp;P Global Manufacturing PMI (Aug) Estimates: 49.%, Prior: 49 * At 09:45 AM (EST) S&amp;P Global Services PMI (Aug) Estimates: 52.2, Prior: 52.3 * At 09:45 AM (EST) S&amp;P Global Composite PMI (Aug) Estimates: 52, Prior: 52 * At 10:00 AM (EST) New Home Sales MoM (Jul) Impact: Medium * Jackson Hole Symposium Impact: High  &amp;#x200B;  **On the Scanner**  * **Overbought (RSI):** LLY (78), X (74), TEVA (67), TJX (64), NVAX (63) * **Oversold (RSI):** HE (13), SE (17), M (18), C (20), JWN (23), UPS (25) * **High IV:** FL (+178%), ORCL (+148%), GPS (+135%), KSS (+125%) * **Unusual Options Volume:** M (+1090%), FL (+1083%), NVAX (+1034%), KSS (+1030%), WYNN (+957%), JWN (+862%), PTON (+797%), ZM (+529%)  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-08-23 13:49:56]
[Expected Moves this week, SPY, VIX, QQQ, MU and more.,;,; SPY was lower last week by about 0.6%, again, inside what options were pricing. Implied vol closed extremely low into the weekend, with SPY some at-the-money SPY weekly options sporting single-digit handles. That IV should reset a bit higher out of the weekend but overall vol remains historically below average and at multi-year lows. The VIX closed last week below 13.50. Of course, vol could always go lower, but it's getting to the point where those lower moves would be quite small. In general the 12-13 range in the VIX floor over the past 5 years and only on rare occasions over longer time horizons do you see it closer to 10. That's not to say it can't remain this low for a long time, but it can't get much lower. One thing to note from the past 2 weeks, the daily realized moves of the market versus what 0DTE options had been pricing has started to tip a bit in the favor of the market moves over the expected moves, particularly in the QQQ. That kind of action tends to put a floor on IV as well as option trading in same-day expiry is heavy volume and being more or less re-priced each day based on the prior day's result. Futures are flat to lower to start off the week.  This past weekend included some political chaos in Russia but markets this week will most likely concentrate on a combo of economic data like GDP &amp; Durable Goods and speeches by Lagarde (tues) and Powell (wed, thurs). SPY options are pricing about a 1.1% move for the week at 10 vol (at the money) although that could get a lift on the open.

[Expected moves, NFP jobs, SPY, VIX Apple and more.,;,; Non Farm Payrolls drop at 8:30 ET and suddenly take on new significance after the market reaction yesterday to ADP employment data. As pointed out in this space a few times recently, stocks have largely ignored rising treasury yields (higher interest rate assumptions) over the past few months as the fears of a bad recession faded a little. But with recent strong data and hawkish words from the Fed, yields have plowed higher and traders showed some concern for the first time in a while the past 2 days. The 1-year yield is now at its highest level since 2000, the 2yr traded yesterday at its highest level since 2006 and the 10yr is at its highest level since 2007. Where yields go next are likely to affect the market's next moves and the NFP this morning will be the last data point in a slew of news we received in the second part of this week. The VIX got as high as 17 yesterday, indicating some renewed interest in option buying. It pulled back a bit late and is now 15.80. But this is the first bit of life option buyers have shown in months. Futures are basically unchanged into the NFP print. The expected move for SPY today is about 0.5% with the QQQ about 0.8%.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Movers:**     * Gorilla Technology Group Inc (GRRR) +59.33% * Prestige Wealth Inc (PWM) +116.67% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +3.38% * Zhong Yang Financial Group Limited (TOP) +13.64% * Tesla Inc (TSLA) -0.30% * Alibaba Group Holding ADR (BABA) +2.81% * Xpeng Inc ADR (XPEV) -2.69% * Nio Inc ADR (NIO) -0.42% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.03% * Levi Strauss &amp; Company Cl A (LEVI) -7.17% * Alphabet Cl A (GOOGL) -0.17%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**     * ImmunoPrecise Antibodies Ltd.

[Expected Moves this Week: Low IV into NFP and an Earnings Lull, SPY, QQQ, IWM and more.,;,; ## Market View  **Last Week ‚Äì Another positive week and an IV collapse.**  SPY was up 3.5% last week, a move much larger than options were pricing. But because the move was to the upside, and came on the heels of some relieving bank headlines, implied vol collapsed. The VIX is now within a point of its lowest levels of 2023 and is down from 26 to 18.70 since the SVB drama, and actually at or below its historical mean. IV for SPY options expiring this week are in the 10-13 IV range, down significantly from the weekly IV near 30 we saw into the CPI and FOMC in March. There is a slight uptick in SPY IV into the next CPI April 12th, but only to 16 IV at the moment.  **This Week ‚Äì A Jobs Report, but on a holiday.**  SPY options are pricing about a 1.2% move for the 4 day week. This is a holiday week in the second half with Passover beginning Wednesday night and then markets closed for Good Friday. There will be some focus on the NFP release on Friday as market participants are now on the lookout for any signs of recession but the reaction will not come until the following Monday. Stock valuations are on the high side historically after the recent recovery in the market and the set-up into earnings season later this month isn‚Äôt necessarily pricing in the effects of a possible recession. So any signs of cracks on the economic front will be a focus. However, the bull case is that if the Fed is indeed winding down rate hikes and if inflation continues to moderate, the economy may have escaped the worst possible scenario. The NFP this week, CPI on the 12th, and the first 2 weeks of earnings reports in late April should give some clues.  Last week we highlighted the rapid IV decline in The Russell 2000. Options in IWM were pricing in a 5-day move of 4% two weeks ago, 2.7% last week, and this week just 1.8% (4 day week). So the options market is now pricing in much more typical moves in small-cap stocks than in the midst of the banking turmoil. Below is the IWM chart showing the large recent moves and the much smaller expected move now as a result of a collapse in IV (with this Friday highlighted):  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/s7q87qrr1jra1.png?width=1249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aed5a3b6ca504ed477a72f0d38d8a9dc68113bed  **Expected Moves for This Week**¬†([via Options AI‚Äôs free tools](https://tools.optionsai.com/))  * SPY¬†**1.2%** * QQQ **1.6%**¬† * IWM¬†**1.8%**  * DIA¬†**1.1%**   &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar**  * Monday ‚Äì **ISM Manufacturing** * Tuesday ‚Äì **ADP Employment, ISM Services** * Friday ‚Äì **Non-Farm Payrolls (markets closed)**  &amp;#x200B;  **Unusual Option Volume Friday**  * **HAS, AI, BB, SNOW, TSLA, UPST, UBS, ARKK, CLOV, DDOG, QQQ, SPY**  &amp;#x200B;  ## Earnings This Week  Via the Expected move, weekly IV, and prior earnings moves (starting with most recent).  Earnings are really light this week but pick up in the second half of April. Next week some of the banks report, with Citi and Wells Fargo late in the week, then things really heat up the week of April 17th with Schwab, Goldman and Bank of America followed by Netflix and Tesla. The week of April 24th sees the big tech names like Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet etc.  You can take a peek ahead on the [Options AI Earnings Calendar](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings-calendar) (free to use) showing expected moves as currently priced and past moves for comparison.

[Expected moves: VIX pickup, SPY, QQQ Grind lower. Rare Friday Earns from Palo Alto,;,; Stocks are lower again to start Friday. It's been a rough week overall, with the SPY down about 2.5% or so. That's more than double the move options were pricing, and the moves have been a bit more than 0DTE options have been pricing each day. Near-term options are waking up a bit, with 0DTE pricing in expected moves for SPY now out at about 0.7% or so each day, that's up from just 0.4% a few weeks ago. The VIX is now near 19 meaning 30-day vol is back to about its historical average. One interesting data point to add to this is that the SPY itself has not been THAT volatile. It's off a bit more than 5% from its highs, and the recent selling has been a grind lower, not much panic selling. That's not just a *vibe*, the realized vol in SPY for the past 30 days is still just 10. That will likely begin to increase a bit with the past week seeing moves in excess of what options were pricing, but again, the selling has been orderly in the major indices thus far.  Nothing on the economic data front today but next week is the Jackson Hole Conference which takes on some additional significance after this week's more hawkish than expected FOMC minutes as well as what's going on in China's markets.  A rare after-hours on Friday earnings report today from Palo Alto Networks. That may have some traders spooked a bit as it does feel like a Friday news dump (where you'd try to bury bad news when everyone is already away from their desks).

[Expected moves today, GDP, Powell, Nike, SPY and QQQ,;,; Futures are higher this morning, with the market trying to end the quarter/first half of the year on a high note. SPY is up about 0.75% on the week as of yesterday's close. On the year the SPY is up about 14%, with the QQQ up an impressive 37%. Today, Jay Powell again speaks in Europe. On the economic front, we get the GDP number with the important PCE inflation data on Friday giving us a sense of the mood of the Fed, as well as growth and preferred inflation data they're trying to navigate. Vol remains low, with very few expectations of large market swings anytime in the near future. The VIX futures term structure remains steep, but December is now 19.5, very near the VIX's historical mean. In other words, vol is inexpensive near term, with the market's actual day-to-day vol muted, but longer-term options are also getting to some of the lowest levels we've seen in the past few years. After the bell we get results from Nike. Options are pricing about a 5.5% move.   **Expected move today (0DTE)**   SPY: 0.5%   QQQ: 0.7%  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Movers:**  * Joby Aviation Inc (JOBY) +8.71% * Eco Wave Power Global Ab ADR (WAVE) +75.62% * Tesla Inc (TSLA) +1.73% * Blackberry Ltd (BB) +14.97% * Jd.com Inc ADR (JD) -2.59% * Alibaba Group Holding ADR (BABA) -1.00% * Cormedix Inc (CRMD) -20.71%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * NIKE, Inc.

[Expected moves this week: SPY, QQQ, FOMC minutes, Jobs number.,;,; Futures are basically flat this morning into a holiday-shortened session. On the economic data front, the ISM PMI number will drop shortly after the open. Earnings reports are super light this week with nothing really of note today. Last week was a very positive one for stocks with the SPY up 2.3% on the week, a move more than double what options were pricing. With the move higher, IV was even lower, with the VIX actually putting in an intraday print below 13 on Friday. Once again, that's low levels of IV that the market hasn't seen since Covid dropped. Considering this is a holiday-shortened week those low levels are likely warranted, or at least understandable as traders do not want to be sitting on long premium during the dog days of Summer trading. But as has been mentioned in this space, it doesn't take much for stocks to move beyond those small expected moves, particularly on weeks like last week where there's a persistent bid in the market on a slow grind higher. Traders should be very very aware of both the risk of long premium, but also of how tight the breakeven levels of short premium trades can be with IV this low. Active trade management with small-win mentalities is how many traders approach these conditions.   For this week, SPY options are pricing just under a 1% move for what amounts to a 3-and-a-half-day week. That could change coming out of the holiday for the final 3 days as traders may re-adjust to more regular market hours. That's particularly true this week as the economic calendar picks up on Wednesday with FOMC minutes, then Thursday ISM services PMI, ADP jobs, and of course the non-farm payrolls on Friday. The earnings calendar is light this week but picks up in the second half of the month with banks and airlines beginning to report mid-month with big tech rolling in late month.   &amp;#x200B;  **Today's expected move (0DTE)**   * SPY 0.4%  * QQQ 0.5%  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market:**     * Tesla Inc (TSLA) +6.13% * Nio Inc ADR (NIO) +4.44% * Micron Technology (MU) +0.19% * Xpeng Inc ADR (XPEV) +7.53% * Lucid Group Inc (LCID) +1.60% * Alphabet Cl C (GOOG) -0.32% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +2.16% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.32% * Unitedhealth Group Inc (UNH) -0.48% * Astrazeneca Plc ADR (AZN) -6.62% * Li Auto Inc ADR (LI) +5.84% * Zhong Yang Financial Group Limited (TOP) -5.22%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**   none of note  Full list here: [Options AI Earnings Calendar](http://url5578.options.ai/ls/click?upn=WHju0C1BRPoBuTdL0xEcqZNWu421ak771SLA5jzpsv-2BU8w7tMzcR-2B7I-2FswbV9O3IjjJgP1PQKL9ll-2BR2phXTZw-3D-3DI8Ym_yIbKbwLGaUiHkJ2rj-2FVSLO9FkCqgwrqJUZFsR-2FM-2BW6g1NUq5hkNfzxZGFziJBIqnJxtsA-2B6Nrh8CHL3OufU5QY5TkfelaO1-2BVX2-2BiE-2FOZYaESMPanMchodgzcuMV0SgXO0AWKQd0mPpCRbCJDvN9W1GqkaDtImOkH-2Bbf1rhBfNkJBwlIHnnf3rnGYrTRJbV53inlMhXT9KYHuKttkJlHI07mLOUxQwQn95JkZBpkSiMSR7neN-2FOUxGNgHxdbUlWDEDktnN7lJEPQ-2BTeDCg2QwMHUdLJCl3QcGKqcu5GnI6jIw3yMfzVU2ViljSittYGoBR4tw1Bve23XIL5Ah1JqPw-3D-3D)  &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar:**     * At 09:45 AM (EST) S&amp;P Global Manufacturing PMI (Jun) Estimates: 46.3, Prior: 48.4 * At 10:00 AM (EST) ISM Manufacturing PMI (Jun) Estimates: 47, Prior: 46.9 * At 10:00 AM (EST) ISM Manufacturing Employment (Jun) Estimates: 50.5, Prior: 51.4  &amp;#x200B;  **Scanner Highlights:**   Based on the prior day's trading action.     * **Overbought (RSI):** DAL (87), AAL (81), LUV (80), OSTK (80), JBLU (79), JETS (78), AAPL (78), OPEN (77), SNAP (74) * **Oversold (RSI):** OKTA (39), ETSY (39), MU (40), KO (40), TGT (40), ABBV (40), DOCU (41), GLD (41), JD (41) * **High IV:** NKLA (+211%), AMC (+206%), MANU (+172%), AZN (+136%), OSTK (+116%), SOFI (+114%), BUD (+113%), AMGN (+102%), RIVN (+102%), MRK (+101%), SPOT (+100%) * **Unusual Options Volume:** CMCSA (+1401%), BITO (+657%), XLI (+561%), RIG (+556%), OSTK (+531%), NKE (+486%), MSTR (+475%), CCL (+473%), AAPL (+450%), JPM (+440%), UPS (+398%)  Full lists here: [Options AI Free Tools](http://url5578.options.ai/ls/click?upn=WHju0C1BRPoBuTdL0xEcqZNWu421ak771SLA5jzpsv8cedLq-2BOIzmLf53JNdlOJzY-4L_yIbKbwLGaUiHkJ2rj-2FVSLO9FkCqgwrqJUZFsR-2FM-2BW6g1NUq5hkNfzxZGFziJBIqnJxtsA-2B6Nrh8CHL3OufU5QY5TkfelaO1-2BVX2-2BiE-2FOZYaESMPanMchodgzcuMV0SgXO0AWKQd0mPpCRbCJDvN9W1GqkaDtImOkH-2Bbf1rhBfNkJBwlIHnnf3rnGYrTRJbV5FWE7SR5ZYQ38PnWAVxYkk6phKmNLWVeaSOon7itLSkqDoFb0fXzcESRQ6FiLJhOH6TO-2F6u4u0cIyP066EqG8uMbwr2XCLWq9cGtiMiWTE4McvzQS4MMp8v7tzQyXuKeeHFcxOACyKedh7OcxtR1dBQ-3D-3D).  &amp;#x200B;  **Chart of the Day:**  SPY options are pricing less than a 1% move for the week but that could change out of the holiday.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/7r7h6kao3r9b1.png?width=840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dfcf65a33ac01fc015eea4825b72938c0e803b15,;,; 2023-07-03 13:22:44]
[Expected moves: A little life in market vol, SPY QQQ VIX Netflix and more,;,; Stock futures are lower for the second straight day. It's a big two days for economic data, following yesterday's Fed minutes. This morning, ADP reported \~500k private sector jobs added, doubling expectations. That sent futures lower as it's yet another sign the FOMC is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer and potentially be more aggressive with raises. The US 2-year treasury yield is above 5% near this year's high, but more importantly, nearing levels it hasn't seen since 2006. Stocks have absorbed higher interest rate assumptions over the past 2 months quite well, rising with the rising yields. That played out mainly due to lessening fears of a recession (and the AI hype driving tech stocks higher). If the jobs number comes in hot tomorrow it will be just the latest data point pointing to a persistently strong economy, driving yields higher, and assumptions of a more hawkish Fed for the balance of 2023. There are signs elsewhere in the economic data of an economy that's cooling off in certain sectors, but jobs and hiring has remained strong, and we'll find out more on the front tomorrow. This 2-day pullback in stocks is breathing a little life into option vol. The VIX is now \~15.30, up from 13 just a few trading days ago.   As was mentioned in this space, vol got about as low as you'd ever see over the past two weeks. That didn't mean it would immediately go higher, but it was unlikely to go much lower. A 15.30 VIX is still historically low but it does show a little appetite for traders to buy options. Something we haven't seen much of over the past several weeks. Skew is near the highest levels of the past few years, meaning downside put strikes were already more expensive than upside call strikes. That is largely reflective of a low IV environment where the percentage differences get magnified, but keep an eye on that skew number as the VIX rises, if it remains high, it would be showing continued demand for puts even at higher vol, and therefore be a good indication of any fear in the market.   With earnings season approaching, it's also interesting to look at how low individual stock IV got and how it's pricing upcoming earnings. Netflix, which reports on the 19th, has 55 IV at the moment for the event, pricing in about an 8% move (that includes all the time leading up to the event as well.) For perspective, in Netflix's last 6 earnings, the stock has moved less than 8% just twice and has had +/-7% moves 5 out of 6 times. In other words, vol is low in most individual stocks as compared o the past 2 years, and with earnings right around the corner, you'll see much smaller expected moves on average (as of now).  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Movers:**     * Tesla Inc (TSLA) -0.44% * Allarity Therapeutics Inc (ALLR) -51.57% * Bioxcel Therapeutics Inc (BTAI) +23.73% * Genius Sports Ltd (GENI) +9.12% * Meta Platforms Inc (META) +1.70% * Lucid Group Inc (LCID) -1.48% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +0.29% * Riot Platforms Inc (RIOT) +3.24% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.16% * Affirm Holdings Inc Cl A (AFRM) -5.06% * Perion Network Ltd (PERI) +7.22%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**     * Levi Strauss &amp; Co.

Let‚Äôs see if Tesla stock is a buy right now or if there are better opportunities ahead.  **Q1 Preview**  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tesla‚Äôs Q1 earnings is $0.85 per share, which would be a -20% decline from EPS of $1.07 in the prior-year quarter. Sales are expected to be up 25% at $23.56 billion Vs. $18.76 billion in Q1 2022.  The dip in Tesla‚Äôs YoY quarterly bottom line is partly attributed to higher commodity prices among raw materials like steel and aluminum in correlation with inflation. However, Tesla has also implemented several price cuts in the pricing of its EVs to boost deliveries and roll out newer models.  [ ](https://preview.redd.it/nc3nuu2udmua1.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d91a2d5fcfc7ad728237fb839d2e98f65d8a143)  Image Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  While Tesla hopes its price cuts will boost demand and lead to higher sales volume, Wall Street will be closely monitoring the effect this has on the company‚Äôs earnings. To that point, many analysts are concerned that lower vehicle pricing will chip away at Tesla‚Äôs profit margins with the comany cutting its prices five times since January.  Tesla has now dropped the prices of its Model S sedan by roughly 5% to $89,000 and its Model X SUV by 9% to $99,000. The luxury versions of these models have also been lowered by about $5,000.  With that being said, the Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction indicates Tesla should reach its Q1 earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate also at $0.85 per share.   **Deliveries¬†&amp;¬†Demand**¬†   The ability to continue expanding deliveries is critical during Tesla‚Äôs quarterly results. In this regard, the increasing popularity and demand for EVs may justify Tesla‚Äôs willingness to slash its prices. With demand in focus, Tesla announced earlier in the month that it delivered a quarterly record of 422,875 vehicles during the first quarter, a 36% increase from 310,000 deliveries in Q1 2022. ¬†  This would still fall short of Wall Street‚Äôs estimates of 430,000 deliveries for the first quarter. As shown in the chart below, Tesla stock soared in its last quarterly report after beating delivery expectations but plummetted in the prior quarter when missing estimates. Still, Tesla‚Äôs ability to offer strong guidance for continued delivery growth next quarter could boost its stock.   **Growth &amp; Outlook**  Tesla is still the global leader in EV sales and controls about 65% of the market share in the United States. However, monitoring Tesla‚Äôs growth is very important for investors with companies like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) looking to even the playing field.  According to Zacks estimates, Tesla earnings are expected to dip -5% this year but rebound and climb 33% in fiscal 2024 at $5.11 per share. It is important to note that earnings estimate revisions have gone down over the last quarter. ¬†  On the top line, sales are forecasted to jump 25% in FY23 and soar another 21% in FY24 to $123.03 billion. More impressive, fiscal 2024 would be a very stellar 401% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $24.57 billion.

As a loose comparison, Tesla has easily topped General Motors‚Äô +4% and Ford‚Äôs +9% YTD performance.  Even better, Tesla stock has now climbed +272% over the last three years to beat the benchmark, General Motors‚Äô +41%, Ford‚Äôs +151%, and its Zacks Subindustry‚Äôs +88%.   Shares of TSLA currently trade around $187 and 48.2X forward earnings which is well below its extreme decade-long high and 78% beneath the median of 223.9X. Tesla still trades above the industry average of 10.8X but Wall Street has historically been ok with paying a premium for the company's growth as a leader and pioneer in its space.  **Bottom Line**  Going into its Q1 report Tesla stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).¬†Tesla‚Äôs annual top and bottom line growth is still intriguing despite¬†the decline in earnings estimates with its more reasonable P/E valuation offering support.  Although the recent price cuts among its EVs may lead to better buying opportinuies in Tesla stock, this should also boost future demand. In this regard, investors could be¬† rewarded for holding on to Tesla shares at current levels especially as inflation begins to ease.¬†,;,; 2023-04-18 10:29:41]

[TSLA: Cybertruck‚Äôs About to Nuke Boomer Auto,;,; Alright degens I've been crunching some numbers that are gonna make you twitch. People say the Cybertruck is a joke, but I think those smooth-brains have a huge blind spot. Just back in March [Morgan Stanley shat on](https://insideevs.com/news/656606/morgan-stanley-cybertruck-low-volume-prediction/) the truck, predicting just 50k deliveries PER YEAR.  I'll keep it short but let's talk about it.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/67wh9l3twm7b1.png?width=1120&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73dc7d836f45a4065af39ab19791014beec5211f  The Cybertruck has 1.5 million reservations already, and Google Trends data suggests that it could go as mainstream as the Model Y. When Elon tweeted about the Cybertruck in April, the internet broke with searches for it. And guess where these searches came from? Truck-loving areas. Places where all the dudes drive F150s and Silverados. They're flirting.  We all know how boomers in the auto industry like Ford and Chevy milk profits from gas-guzzling trucks to fund their garbage EV projects. But what if Musk and his Cybertruck come in across middle America like a wrecking ball? Cash cow slaughtered. Margins decimated.  I smell blood, and I think you do too.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/grulj39uwm7b1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b59bb746c62ca30fbdc6bdce2460f0e7026fcd9  Remember back in 2014, when everyone laughed at the idea of EVs? The US Energy Information Administration predicted them to have a tiny market share by 2040. Well, EVs hit 5% of the US market share last year, and the projection has been increased each year. Now, they're saying it'll be like 14% by 2040. They're worse at predictions than JPow and the fed are about inflation.  Even with that lowball number, Tesla‚Äôs got a path for 70%+ global EV market share. That‚Äôs like 8 million cars per year, up from 1.3m last year.  Now, some pencil-pushers are saying trucks will make up 69% of all vehicles in the US by 2040, but EV trucks will only grab a measly 10% of that. Here's what I say to them: üñï  These analysts might be scared of forecasting exponential EV growth, but I think it's about damn time they woke up and smelled the electric engine fires. The Cybertruck will be a nightmare for traditional automakers.  So this might be a good time to bump up your TSLA exposure. This is not financial advice, but those Cybertruck numbers should blow whiny analysts‚Äô expectations out of the water.  tl;dr: Cybertruck is gonna go mainstream, disrupting traditional automakers and sending EV growth to the moon. Hold onto your seats, apes. Watch those Cybertrucks fly off the shelves and print tendies with me through 2024.  Position: Long $TSLA.

CEO Elon Musk plans to reveal his "Master Plan 3" with analysts predicting announcements including a new Tesla EV platform, confirmation of a planned Mexico factory and potential Tesla Model 3 upgrades.  The event, at Tesla's Austin, Texas, factory, will begin with keynote presentations before turning to a Q&amp;A segment with analysts expecting a big announcement on a new cheaper EV platform, updates on the Cybertruck as well as other news.  Tesla may also confirm a long-rumored "Project Highland" Model 3 upgrade. Reuters reported Wednesday an upgraded Model 3, with an emphasis on lower production costs, will go into production in September at the company's Shanghai facility. Tesla is also updating the Model Y with interior and exterior changes with a 2024 production target, according to Reuters.  "The thing to look for this year is the Gen 3 platform, which is key to growth as it will allow lower-cost EVs which should boost volume as demand stalls and competition ramps up," Third Bridge analyst Orwa Mohamad wrote late Tuesday.  Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador also announced Tuesday Tesla plans to build a manufacturing plant in Monterrey. Additional details will be released Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported.  Tesla has repeatedly teased an EV that would sit around the $25,000 price point. CFO Zachary Kirkhorn, during the Q4 earnings call, said the "next-generation vehicle platform" was a priority.

(Nasdaq: TLSA) (‚ÄúTiziana‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a biotechnology company developing breakthrough immunomodulation therapies via novel routes of drug delivery, today announced a publication in the preeminent1 journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), that illustrates the immunological basis of the mechanism of action (MoA) for intranasal foralumab. A copy of the article can be found at pnas.org.2  Howard L. Weiner, M.D., Co-Director of the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at BWH and Chairman of Tiziana's Scientific Advisory Board, stated, ‚ÄúI am proud to be senior author on this important publication. The identification of a unique mechanism associated with nasal foralumab in humans was consistent across patients with COVID, multiple sclerosis and in healthy volunteers. This modulation of T cell inflammatory response that resulted from suppressing effector features in multiple T cell subsets is consistent with other research done at the Ann Romney Center and validates our scientific rationale for the upcoming IND filing to investigate intranasal foralumab in Alzheimer‚Äôs.‚Äù  Dr. Tanuja Chitnis, M.D., Professor of Neurology at Brigham Women‚Äôs Hospital (BWH) said, ‚ÄúIt is an honor to be an author on this seminal research. Furthermore, the unique immunomodulatory signature of intranasal foralumab makes it a promising therapeutic candidate for several rare Orphan pediatric neuroinflammatory diseases, which currently remain untreated. It is my hope to study intranasal foralumab in these underserved indications.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThis upcoming quarter will be an eventful and productive period for Tiziana,‚Äù stated¬†Matthew W. Davis, M.D., RPh, Chief Medical Officer of Tiziana. ‚ÄúThe publication of foralumab‚Äôs detailed mechanism of action dovetails with our forthcoming Alzheimer‚Äôs IND filing for intranasal foralumab and the Phase 2 FDA review comments for our proposed MS trial, all of which are expected this month. March will also be the third month of intranasal foralumab administration in four Expanded Access (EA 3 through EA 6) patients followed by data updates in Q2 2023.Tiziana remains on track to begin its Phase 2 intranasal foralumab non-active Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis trial in Q3 of this year.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI am thrilled that PNAS has chosen to publish this critical research on intranasal foralumab,‚Äù commented¬†Gabriele Cerrone, Executive Chairman and interim Chief Executive Officer of Tiziana. ‚ÄúHaving an intranasal fully human monoclonal antibody that positively modulates the immune system allows Tiziana to explore multiple inflammatory disease indications in addition to multiple sclerosis (MS), and greatly increases the value of our groundbreaking research. The Company also notes Dr. Chitnis‚Äôs exciting desire to study intranasal foralumab in rare Orphan pediatric diseases. Tiziana may pursue this unique and attractive opportunity when funding becomes available.‚Äù  About Foralumab  Activated T cells play an important role in the inflammatory process. Foralumab, the only fully human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), binds to the T cell receptor, dampens inflammation by modulating T cell function, thereby suppressing effector features in multiple immune cell subsets, an effect demonstrated in patients with COVID and with multiple sclerosis, as well as in healthy normal subjects. Intranasal foralumab Phase 2 trials are expected to start in Q3 2023 in patients with non-active SPMS. Immunomodulation by nasal anti-CD3 mAb represents a novel avenue for treatment of inflammatory human diseases.2  About¬†Tiziana Life Sciences  Tiziana Life Sciences¬†is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing breakthrough therapies using transformational drug delivery technologies to enable alternative routes of immunotherapy. Tiziana‚Äôs innovative nasal, oral and inhalation approaches in development have the potential to provide an improvement in efficacy as well as safety and tolerability compared to intravenous (IV) delivery. Tiziana‚Äôs lead candidate, intranasal foralumab, the only fully human anti-CD3 mAb, has demonstrated a favorable safety profile and clinical response in patients in studies to date. Tiziana‚Äôs technology for alternative routes of immunotherapy has been patented with several applications pending and is expected to allow for broad pipeline applications.    https://www.brighamandwomens.org/about-bwh/newsroom/press-releases-detail?id=4382,;,; 2023-03-08 12:39:59]

[Tech giants $ROKU, $TSLA, and $SQ battle it out for the title of best growth stock,;,; &amp;#x200B;   **Roku ($ROKU)**  Roku generates a significant portion of its revenue through advertising and content distribution services on its streaming platform. The company also sells streaming devices. Roku‚Äôs revenue grew 1% to $741 million in Q1 2023 and surpassed analysts‚Äô estimates. It reported a lower-than-anticipated loss per share of $1.38, although losses widened considerably compared to $0.19 in the prior-year quarter.¬† ¬†¬†     The average revenue per user (ARPU) declined 5% year-over-year to $40.67. The company expects advertising spend to remain under pressure throughout this year due to macro challenges.  ## Is Roku a Good Stock to Buy?  Following the Q1 results in late April, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein maintained a Buy rating on Roku stock but lowered his price target to $75 from $85. Explaining his investment stance, the analyst stated that platform revenue has stabilized, with upcoming tailwinds from advertisers, agencies, retail media, and DSP integrations.  Given headwinds from slowing ad spend by subscription video on-demand (SVOD) providers and higher ‚Äúscatter market exposure,‚Äù Helfstein expects Roku to be one of the first beneficiaries of any recovery in the ad market.  Wall Street‚Äôs Moderate Buy consensus rating on Roku is based on 11 Buys, seven Holds, and three Sells. The average price target of $69.74 implies about 25% upside. ¬†  ¬†¬†¬†   https://preview.redd.it/0gffnzk39cza1.png?width=685&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98721a37e42b6a999501d1ba0065f409be3f4309     ## Tesla ($TSLA)  Investors were unimpressed with Tesla‚Äôs first-quarter performance, as the company‚Äôs earnings declined due to the impact of price cuts on margins. The company also cited underutilization of new factories, higher raw material, commodity, logistics, and warranty costs, and lower revenue from environmental credits as the reasons for margin contraction.     During the Q1 earnings call CEO Elon Musk justified the company‚Äôs pricing strategy, saying that a focus on higher volumes and a larger fleet is the ‚Äúright choice‚Äù than lower volumes and higher margins. Musk expects Tesla‚Äôs vehicles to generate significant profit over time through its autonomy feature.  Following multiple price cuts, Tesla recently hiked the prices of several cars in the U.S., Canada, China, and Japan. Nonetheless, prices remain lower than the levels seen at the start of this year.     ## Is Tesla a Buy, Hold, or Sell?  Earlier this month, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter lowered his price target to $280 from $300 but reiterated a Buy rating. The analyst reduced his 2023-2025 estimates to reflect price cuts and their impact on margins. While Potter agrees with management's view that margins will eventually rise due to software, he contends that this won't happen quickly enough to offset the near-term impact of lower prices, higher warranty costs, and slower inventory turnover.  On the positive side, Potter thinks that the global average selling price (ASP) could fall by \~$125 per unit every quarter for the next two years without hurting margins due to production credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.  Until margins and other fundamentals start improving, Potter believes that TSLA might struggle to ‚Äúcatch a bid.‚Äù¬†Nevertheless, he remains bullish on the stock and expects investors to turn around in the second half of the year and beyond.   Wall Street‚Äôs Moderate Buy consensus rating on Tesla is based on 15 Buys, 12 Holds, and four Sells. The average price target of $202.15 suggests nearly 20% upside.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/t2pdkftb9cza1.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5c3526300ba871ed77dd6123740e354f29e7a38     ## Block ($SQ)  Shares of fintech Block declined sharply in March after short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the company of inflating the number of users on its Cash App system. The company shook off these concerns by reporting better-than-expected Q1 2023 results last week.  Adjusted EPS jumped 122% to $0.40 in Q1 2023, driven by a 26% rise in revenue to about $5 billion and enhanced margins. Results gained from solid momentum in the company‚Äôs Cash App peer-to-peer ecosystem. Cash App‚Äôs gross profit increased 49% to $931 million. Meanwhile, Square, the company‚Äôs ecosystem focused on merchants, delivered a gross profit of $770 million, up 16% from the prior-year quarter.  Based on the gross profit momentum in Q1, the company increased its full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook to $1.36 billion from the previous guidance of $1.30 billion. ¬†¬†  ## What is the Price Target for SQ Stock?  Following Block‚Äôs results, Needham analyst Mayank Tandon reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but lowered his price target to $80 from $95, given the lower market valuations for stocks in the payments space.     The analyst highlighted that Q1 results beat expectations because the robust momentum in the Cash App business offset softer seller trends as volumes faded during the quarter. Tandon remains positive on Block based on the company‚Äôs focus on driving profitable long-term growth and an expanding product suite as payments continue to shift to digital channels.  With 23 Buys and seven Holds, Square earns Wall Street‚Äôs Strong Buy consensus rating. At $91.19, the average price target suggests 58.5% upside.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/kvwznfmg9cza1.png?width=696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=814bbc24a177e04332680dd12200179a146fb3b3     ## Conclusion  Block shares have underperformed Tesla and Roku stocks so far this year. However, analysts are more bullish about Block and see higher upside potential in the stock compared to the other two growth stocks.,;,; 2023-05-12 05:58:31]

[Dow Jones rises but leaders tumble, and Tesla ($TSLA) stock triggers the sell rule.,;,;  Dow Jones futures were little changed early Thursday, along with S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The stock market rally struggled Wednesday as weak economic data raised recession fears for a second straight session.    The major indexes still don't look too bad, with the Nasdaq sliding but the Dow Jones rising.  But once again, declining stocks decisively beat winners. Once again, many of those losers fell hard. But on Wednesday, a lot of more of those big losers were leading stocks, such as **On Holding** ($**ONON**), **MarketAxess** ($**MKTX**) and **PagerDuty** ($**PD**). **C3.ai** ($**AI**) sold off for a second session, with the AI stock now staging a massive, outside week to the downside.  Others, including many chip names, declined solidly, now showing more chart damage after relatively modest retreats Tuesday.  **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) skidded for a third straight day, triggering the automatic sell rule.   Megacap techs such as **Apple** ($**AAPL**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**), Google parent **Alphabet** (**GOOGL**), **Meta Platforms** ($**META**) and **Nvidia** all fell.  Meanwhile, bank stocks came under more pressure. **Western Alliance Bancorp** (**WAL**) plunged, leading a retreat in regional banks, though they pared losses in the afternoon. **Charles Schwab**hit a two-year closing low. While bank deposits may be relatively safe, the bigger issue now may be long-term bank profitability as well as lending curbs that rapidly slow the economy.  Medical names are looking relatively strong, along with other defensive growth or defensive plays.  PagerDuty stock, On Holding, Meta and Nvidia are on **IBD Leaderboard**. Microsoft and Google stock are on the **IBD Long-Term Leaders** list.   Despite relatively benign action in the major indexes, the weakness in growth and other leading stocks is concerning. Investors should be looking to protect profits and cut losses.  ## Costco Sales Weak  Costco same-store sales fell 1.1% in March vs. a year earlier, the first decline in nearly three years. U.S. comps slid 1.5%. Excluding gasoline and currency effects, comps rose 2.6% or 0.9% in the U.S. E-commerce comps tumbled 11.6%. COST stock fell modestly.  ## Dow Jones Futures Today  Dow Jones futures edged higher vs. fair value. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.2%.  The Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. That follows unexpectedly weak February job openings and the March ADP Employment Report. Labor will release the March jobs report on Friday morning, but U.S. markets will be closed.   ## Stock Market Rally  The stock market rally had a generally negative session, despite the mixed action on the major indexes.  The ADP Employment Report showed private payrolls rose much less than expected in March, a day after a big drop in February job openings. The March ISM services index fell more than expected, signaling rapidly slowing growth.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% in Wednesday's **stock market trading**. The S&amp;P 500 index dipped 0.25%. The Nasdaq composite retreated 1.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 1%.  U.S. crude oil prices dipped 0.1% to $80.61 a barrel.  The 10-year Treasury yield declined 5 basis points to 3.285%. That's the lowest point in nearly seven months. The 2-year Treasury yield sank 7 basis points to 3.76%, off 34 basis points in the past four sessions.  ## ETFs  Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ($**FFTY**) shed 1.9%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ($**BOUT**) gave up 0.65%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ($**IGV**) slipped 1.3%. Microsoft stock and a few other heavyweights dominate IGV, while more-speculative software names like PagerDuty suffered bigger losses. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([**SMH**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) gave up 1.75%, with NVDA stock a major holding.  Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF ($**ARKK**) slumped 3.6% and ARK Genomics ETF (**ARKG**) shed 1.8%. TSLA stock is the top holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. Some Ark funds also own PD stock.  SPDR S&amp;P Metals &amp; Mining ETF (**XME**) retreated 1.15% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (**PAVE**) 1.7%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (**JETS**) and SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (**XHB**) descended 1.5%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (**XLE**) climbed 1.5% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (**XLV**) rallied 1.7% to its best level since Feb. 14.  ## Bank Stocks  The Financial Select SPDR ETF (**XLF**) edged down 0.1%, with SCHW stock a top 10 holding. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (**KRE**), which includes WAL stock, sank 1% but finished off lows.  Western Alliance stock plunged as much as 19.4% after releasing some financial metrics but not disclosing deposits. Shares came off their lows as the California-based bank disclosed deposits fell 11% on March 31 vs. the end of 2022, not as bad as some feared. Still, WAL stock closed down 12.4%.,;,; 2023-04-06 11:23:50]

[Tesla ($TSLA) stock and six other tech titans are responsible for 86% of the S&amp;P 500 2023 performance.,;,;    Tesla($TSLA) stock **plunged nearly 10% last week on earnings**. That caught everyone's attention, but it was just the tip of the iceberg.  0 seconds of 14 secondsVolume 0%   With roughly one-third of the S&amp;P 500 companies **announcing quarterly earnings results this week**, there are none bigger than tech titans **Alphabet** ($**GOOGL**), **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**) and **Meta Platforms** ($META). These four Big Tech stocks alone account for 41% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 year-to-date gain, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.  Adding **Apple** ($**AAPL**), which reports next week, **Nvidia** ($**NVDA**) and **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) stock, Colas says these seven tech giants account for 86% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 gain, which was 7.7% through Monday's close. These seven Big Tech stocks have rallied far more than the S&amp;P 500 this year.  According to Colas, there have been three drivers of outperformance for these tech leaders. First, all seven were deeply oversold at the end of 2022 and received a "January Effect" bounce.  The January Effect is a seasonal increase in stock prices throughout the month of January. The increase in demand for stocks in January is often preceded by a decrease in prices during the month of December, in part due to tax-loss harvesting.     Second, many of these tech companies have been aggressively cutting costs, so earnings power should now be higher than last year. And, finally, interest rates have declined, supporting the valuation of high-multiple stocks, he added.  ## Alphabet, Microsoft Earnings Due  Google-owner Alphabet reports earnings after the closing bell Tuesday. Shares are just below a 106.69 buy point in a **cup with handle**, according to **IBD MarketSmith** chart analysis.  Alphabet earnings are expected to measure $1.08 a share on revenue of $68.8 billion.  Dow Jones software giant Microsoft slid almost 2% midday Tuesday, threatening to extend a losing streak to four sessions ahead of the company's earnings results late Tuesday. MSFT stock is rolling back toward a 276.86 buy point in a **flat base** following a March 17 breakout.  Wall Street expects Microsoft to earn $2.24 a share on revenue of $51.0 billion, per FactSet estimates.     ## Amazon, Meta Earnings Also On Deck  E-commerce giant Amazon continues to trace the right side of a **cup base**, but is seeing resistance around its long-term 200-day moving average.  With earnings due out late Thursday, Amazon is expected to earn 21 cents a share on sales of $124.5 billion.  Facebook parent Meta Platforms will report Wednesday after the stock market closes. Meta stock is out of buy range past a **197.26 buy point** in a flat base, but receding.  The social media giant is expected to earn $2.02 a share on revenue of $27.6 billion.  ## Apple Earnings Next Week  Apple shares reversed squarely lower midday Tuesday. Still, they remain solidly above a 157.48 buy point and at the top of the **5% buy range** that runs up to 165.35.  The Dow Jones tech giant reports its fiscal second-quarter results on May 4. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to earn $1.43 a share on sales of $92.9 billion.     ## Nvidia Holds Up; Tesla Stock Breaks Down  Graphics-chip maker Nvidia remains near its recent highs despite sharp losses midday Tuesday. Shares declined more than 2% in afternoon trade.  The **IBD Leaderboard stock** broke out past a 230.59 handle buy point after the **company's strong earnings on Feb. 23**.  Electric-vehicle giant Tesla stock continues to trade near its lowest level since Jan. 26. In recent weeks, shares triggered the **7%-8% loss rule** from a buy point at 200.76 in a cup with handle.

[Can you make money out of a non dividend paying stock without selling it?,;,; This question is very simple but apparently many people can't really answer it for me, so I'm asking you experts because from my point of view, a non-dividend-paying stock behaves **exactly** like Bitcoin.     People holding a stock like TSLA or BRK.A (Buffett already confirmed this stock will never pay dividends) are simply "holding bags" and their ONLY way to make a profit is to sell the stock for a profit to someone who is hoping to do the same, and so on. Is this not correct?     Now you might be saying that unlike Bitcoin, there's a company "behind" the stock which actually makes money or has a business model, and you own a tiny part of it. However, this is not relevant. Just holding TSLA stock won't give you any share of the revenue, or the profits, or any major voting rights, or even access to their facilities, you literally get nothing from it.     The only thing you get from it is that if the company is doing well, then there is "hype" around it so more people want the stock, causing the price to rise with everyone buying it simply to dump it on to someone else for a profit in the future. Conversely, a bad tweet from the CEO can collapse the stock price even if the company's revenue doesn't change. So the price isn't related to how much money they make but how much people "want" the stock (Bitcoin much?)     So literally the ONLY way to make money from your TSLA stock is by selling it to someone else (be it a person or TSLA itself during a buyback), you can't really do anything else with it, can you?,;,; 2023-06-19 11:37:31]
[What would you do in this situation? Serious responses only please,;,; Bought 500 shares of TSLA at $276 a few months back.  I‚Äôm thinking I have two options:  A - Ride it out and check back in a few years. The thing is, half of these I bought on margin so I‚Äôm paying interest every month to baghold these. I can afford to not sell the position because I‚Äôm bullish long term on Tesla and I don‚Äôt need this money now, but man it hurts watching it just go deeper and deeper.  B - sell short dated covered calls (monthlies) with a few strikes above current market since the $280C are pretty much worthless right now. But if the stock turns around in the short term, then I could be totally screwed.  Any thoughts?,;,; 2023-10-26 16:28:07]

I've done my analysis of all the stocks mentioned below according to the analysis mentioned below. Tell me where my analysis falls short and what other methods I should consider (that don't involve technical analysis).   Seeing some recent rave reviews about TSLA, ADBE, and FDX lately. Talking about the charging method Tesla uses becoming the standard in North America and being adopted by SAE, Adobe's investments in generative AI, and Fedex being able to pick up some slack if UPS workers go on strike, as well as some other investments and innovations they've been making.  But the problem is, I just don't see them valued at good prices.   FDX is trading at almost 2.5x book and 21x earnings  ADBE is trading at 15x book, almost 47x earnings, and 12x revenue per share  TSLA is trading at almost 17x book, almost 74x earnings, and over 9x revenue per share.  From a valuation standpoint (P/B, P/E, and P/S), those numbers are completely unjustifiable when considering buying.  So is there something I'm missing? Something I'm failing to consider? It seems like in the case of TSLA and ADBE their tech advancements could be a competitive advantage. Or are these types of stocks just wildly overhyped and overpriced? Because from a valuation perspective (P/B, P/E, and P/S) things like DINO, PBR, TSN, NTR, X, HMC, WFG, BIO, and BNTX look like great buys - why wouldn't I just buy those. They seem much more fairly priced, even cheap...  So what am I missing? What else do I need to consider in my analysis, if anything?,;,; 2023-06-29 03:55:36]

[In attempting to close a short position, what are the odds that the option I am selling gets bought as it is tending towards the money and losing premium value?,;,; I am learning about selling options and I am curious as to what would occur if I tried to close my position as the option starts tending towards the money.  I understand that to close out of my short position, I would need to buy to close. In other words, another trader would need to buy the same option I am selling (at least I think it's another trader).  Taking a look at this TSLA 12/29 $260 Call short position as an example:  [https://imgur.com/a/nvdI0XE](https://imgur.com/a/nvdI0XE)  Once I notice that TSLA has risen to $261.47/share and my option is tending towards the money, I decide to close the position in an effort to retain some of my premium. However, I wonder what the odds are of my order being fulfilled. I guess I am asking because I have never bought an ITM Call. I usually buy OTM Calls that are close to the underlying stocks current price, wait for intrinsic value to increase faster than time decay, and hopefully sell to close for a small profit.  I imagine an options chain relative to TSLA's $261.47/share and a $260 Call is just barely ITM. So, would traders be looking to buy Call options that are barely ITM?  To be clear, I do understand that short positions are an undefined risk and that as a learning trader I must be careful. In my learning process, this is just something I was curious about.

[Tesla trade based on it's own historical data,;,; **Tesla trade taken on 02/17/2023 predicting on what it will not do based on it‚Äôs own historical data.**  Wrote a vertical CALL 400/516.67 for 03/17/23 expiry for TSLA.  Quantity: 100 CALLs  Premium: $600  Portfolio Margin: $5,410  ‚ÄúOnce every 10 year‚Äù lose strike is 407.89  Most, if not all, stock market analysts attempt to divine what a stock or the stock market will do in the future.  They use fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and experience to predict the direction and potential levels to be reached before a potential turning point.  We, on the other hand, analyze what a stock, bond, ETF, or index is unlikely to do in the future based upon its own historical data.  Unlike RSI, Bollinger Bands, or other technical indicators that provide similar information, our measure uses the entire stock/ETF/index trading history to determine what the stock/ETF/index is unlikely to do.  So what is it??  We have developed a machine learning system that measures a symbols' percentage price change versus time for multiple time periods and compares the symbols recent price behavior to its own past to determine if the current behavior is anomalous.  Think of this as a measure of momentum run amok for the symbol.  Our experience has shown that there are two levels of anomalous stock/etf/index behavior that are of interest: (1) When the stock/etf/index current performance is outside of 99% of all prior instances (this is called a Level 1 overbought or oversold condition) and, (2) When the stock/etf/index current performance is outside the bounds of all of its prior history (this is called a Level 2 overbought or oversold condition).  We currently screen 600 stock/etf/index symbols every day - with more being added each week.  These symbols are all traded US stock market exchanges during normal US trading hours.  Figure 1, below, shows a subset of symbols screened for February 17, 2023  [Figure 1.  February 17, 2023 Stock Screener Subset](https://preview.redd.it/e4m303afn6ja1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d0975a9788a4e2728b082a3424f0067fbf643d2)  https://preview.redd.it/he20jp2kn6ja1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1e49189205b41073de6291b1b6640a30b86acd1  https://preview.redd.it/unfret7ln6ja1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a897b2bb14eaf8c9a0023a6347e77d50e926602  So how can we use this overbought/oversold information??  The machine learning system that determines the overbought/oversold condition also provides threshold levels that correspond to what the symbol is unlikely to do in the FUTURE based upon where it is trading now.  Table 1, below, shows various levels and limits with different probabilities of occurrence for TSLA for a subset of future dates.  [Table 1.  TSLA Upper and Lower Closing Limits through March 17th, 2023](https://preview.redd.it/slxq8sgpn6ja1.png?width=994&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ad8cd9b3079343ad155361e6efb00e5178f2f22)  In Table 1, above, we show five (5) columns corresponding to "No loss since inception", "Once Every 10 Years",  "Once Every 5 Years", ‚ÄúOnce Every 1 Years‚Äù, and "1% Raw Data".  Under each column header are sub-headers titled "Lower Limit" and "Upper Limit".  Under each of these sub-headers are prices that reflect what TSLA is unlikely to close below or above for varying probabilities defined the column header.  For instance, in the row corresponding to the 2/23/2023 date, we see a lower limit of 124.42 and upper limit of 312.32 under the No loss since inception column header.  This implies that TSLA closing below $124.42 or above $312.32 on Thursday, February 23, 2023 would be historical (something that's never happened before) on a percentage price change versus time basis.  Likewise, for the 03/17/2023 date, we see a lower limit of $93.82 and upper limit of $407.89 under the Once Every 10 Years header.  This implies that closing below $93.82 or above $407.89 on Friday, March 17th, 2023 would be expected to happen once every 10 years.  Given that there are approximately 252 trading days every year, no lose since inception corresponds to a likelihood of 1 in 2520 or 0.039%.  Finally, in the 1% Raw Data column, the prices reflect a 1% probability of closing below the indicated future lower limit prices or above the indicated future upper limit prices on the corresponding date based upon the entire history of TSLA - including what it's done recently.  So who could benefit from this data??  ‚Ä¢   Options Traders.  The primary beneficiaries of this type of information are options  traders.  By providing closing price levels for a symbol for a given future date, an option trader can write option positions with a known probability of success for both Put and Call options.  ‚Ä¢   Long/short strategies.  Knowing when a stock/ETF/index has moved too far, too fast is an important input in a buying/selling/shorting decision.  This screening decision is done automatically by the machine learning  computers on a daily basis.  The only thing the computer doesn't do is push the buy or sell button for you.  ‚Ä¢   Elliott Wave Practitioners.  Elliott Wave analysis can be a powerful tool for analyzing the likely path a stock/ETF/index may take higher or lower.  However, there are times when multiple paths may present themselves with near equal probability using Elliott Wave analysis alone.  However, many times, one or more possible paths would require the stock/ETF/index to move in a manner that would be unlikely to happen based upon the machine learning analysis.  ‚Ä¢   Fundamentalists.  All traders have two decisions to make:  When to buy and when to sell or vice versa.  A fundamental trader chooses to screen companies based upon fundamental analysis and makes buying decisions based upon this decision.  However, when does the fundamental trader choose to sell, buy more, etc.  The stock screening method explained in this paper can be a useful tool in helping make those decisions with exact price levels.,;,; 2023-02-19 17:52:13]
[Buying shares post-split: good or bad idea?,;,; Many stock splits have occurred in recent years, with companies aiming to increase liquidity within shares and erase barriers to entry for potential investors.  Of course, it's critical to remember that a split does not directly impact a company's financial position or performance.  Several companies ‚Äì  Tesla (TSLA $**TSLA**), Alphabet (GOOGL $**GOOGL**), Palo Alto Networks (PANW $**PANW**), and Shopify (SHOP $**SHOP**) ‚Äì have all split their shares over the last year.  It raises a valid question: is buying post-split a good strategy? Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the performance of each post-split.  **Tesla**  In June of 2022, the mega-popular EV manufacturer announced a three-for-one stock split; shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis on August 25th, 2022.  Since the split, Tesla shares have declined by 45% in value, coming nowhere near the general market‚Äôs performance.

Shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis on July 18th, 2022.  Alphabet shares have retraced 3.5% in value post-split so far, again underperforming relative to the general market.  https://preview.redd.it/u4euu4rqcsva1.png?width=664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4333ebfb94471c99ba69bb15099bb28fe37afe2c  The quarterly earnings estimate has been revised to roughly 5% lower since January, as illustrated below.

The company‚Äôs shares started trading split-adjusted on September 14th, 2022.  Palo Alto Networks shares have been hot throughout 2023, as shown below.

[Histogram Insights on 1-15 Day Returns Across Various Assets,;,;  Numerous research papers typically focus on 1-day or 5-day returns when analyzing market trends. Curious about the broader picture, an extensive analysis was undertaken to plot and examine the return distributions for a range of 1 to 15 days. Conducted over a decade (2013-2024), this study delved into the daily return patterns of a variety of different tickers.  The findings are presented through a series of histograms, each corresponding to a different interval within the 1 to 15-day range, with the x-axis representing the percentage of return. These histograms display how frequently returns fall into various percentage brackets. Each histogram, representing an N-day return period, is organized into 1% bins. Green indicates positive returns, red signifies negative returns, and grey marks returns fluctuating between -0.5% and 0.5%. This color coding provides a nuanced perspective of market movements, and each chart also features a count of positive, negative, and near-zero returns for a quick trend assessment.  Taking $TSLA's 1-day return as an example, it was positive on 1196 days and negative on 1064 days. Over the past decade, holding $TSLA for just one day would have yielded a 52.9% probability of a profitable outcome. Contrastingly, extending the holding period to 15 days, with a positive-to-negative day ratio of 1521 to 1169, increases the likelihood of profit to about 56.54%. This also suggests the possibility for returns exceeding 100% over a 15-day period.  The consistent 1% bin width in the histograms for all tickers and N-day return periods facilitates a direct comparison of return distributions across different assets. This uniform approach allows for a clearer evaluation of volatility and return patterns, making it easier to assess and compare the performance characteristics of various investments.  Feedback on these findings and suggestions for further research are encouraged and appreciated.  P.S.: The tickers included in this analysis are "TSLA", "NVDA", "GME", "BABA", "SPY", "QQQ", "GLD", "XLE", "ARKK", "INDX:VIX", Bitcoin, and Ethereum.     &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/v3ultfg9ltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf0d01abe89c963c65db38db00fe30846a0409e1  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ghe6byzaltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03e6260458c76accc2cd92e9694ee3f0cd8bbda6  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/v1qwiwfcltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24b9c4cb6280dd298cebf868d500f4a4fb400224  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/uucun7qdltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1d540c7a889d540e5fce932a03ccaefa2c43c97  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/b5uqdg0fltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbed2ea62a7a77e84ab43282c48f69f5556f6d2c  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/047go8ngltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7be62969e40b6f59a122e7e2d30eaa2893b53b5d  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/hvfp1c7kltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e6a17aebb5ff2246c8a9986cd418e71e134cf69  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/qmpnsp7lltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50952d4a010b4346dd24bfa5f1ab538bf00fc2ef  https://preview.redd.it/3psqbl4iltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34c8388e1db76ff57f3fd00433d70e8f6fca8a91  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/cwco4e8mltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f908c2ec8986730cc11ba88836f4ce00c8f68cba  https://preview.redd.it/pyx14h8mltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e05c50c5c7a935d56c4b48d93583c5fa00fc409,;,; 2024-01-16 15:26:44]

[Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY?,;,; A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings:  https://preview.redd.it/evtbd2dnkgec1.png?width=654&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47c5c6d9f58e6997aad5330dba32ff543e2c8541  Data Sources:  * SPY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/spy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Schwab](https://www.schwab.wallst.com/schwab/Prospect/research/etfs/schwabETF/index.asp?type=holdings&amp;symbol=SPY)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/?guccounter=1)‚Äã‚Äã. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST)‚Äã * SFY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/sfy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Zacks.com](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SFY/holding)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SFY/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST)  **Key Observations:**  * Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. * Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. * Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.  It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.  I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:  1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. 2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&amp;P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. 3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. 4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. 5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. 6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.  It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.  **What are your thoughts?**,;,; 2024-01-24 21:46:21]

[QQQ vs SPY ratio rollover is happening,;,; This selloff off the most recent top is not broad based. The big tech darlings are leading the decline.  The QQQ and the SPY are equal for the most part except that the QQQ has a higher weighting of tech while the SPY has oil and gas, banks, and various other non tech sectors.  The strongest sector last week was probably oil and gas. Look at XLE, USO, DBC, etc. All were up.  The last time there was a rollover in the QQQ vs SPY ratio was after the August 2022 top. It didn't go back up until after the bottom in December. The one prior to that was the rollover at the end of 2021.   The entire market is not melting down. The oil and gas sector is bullish. The VIX is tame. Treasury yields are rising. Big tech retail favorites are getting hit. This is more like the beginning of 2022. Not the beginning of 2023. GDP estimates are freaking 5.8% for the 3rd quarter. Headline CPI has bottomed. Energy CPI is going back up.  It seems many Youtubers are still bullish the tech favorites like TSLA and PLTR and buying the dip. Anyone buying up the hated commodity sector?

[S&amp;P500 bad performance during inflation proof,;,; Hello,  &amp;#x200B;  I've ran the math and the S&amp;P500 during Covid just followed the money in circulation (M2 money supply). The increase in both was around 33%, so basically the net asset value is flat, as this 33% increase has the same purchasing power. But when I compared some of the top companies in the Indice APPL, MSFT, GOOG, TSLA and AMZN I've noticed that all of them made way more than 33%. Does this indicate it's way better for a safe haven investing **during inflationary times** to just focus on the top 5-10 instead of the "whole" market (the 500 companies).  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/bn79ul88gelb1.png?width=2340&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38ddd3c12d9f26e644bb0e6b8e6d3fbe30a8f54b  I also did the math for the lowest 5 companies currently, as I don't know which they were during 2020 January. Only 1 company beat the 33% inflation and 4 were actually on a major LOSS.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/qb10mz7nfelb1.png?width=2333&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0e4955113542fd4a7ee483ff3da15815be016cc  Considering that S&amp;P500 is influenced more by the top than the bottom companies we can logically assume that the majority of the top companies performed poorly, as they are anywhere close to the absurd returns of the top 5-10.

[Tesla net income and earnings drop more than 20% from last year,;,; Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.  Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv  Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates  Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.  Automotive revenue, Tesla‚Äôs core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.  Tesla‚Äôs first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.  The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.  Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.  Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.   Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management‚Äôs consideration were seeking updates on the company‚Äôs trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company‚Äôs energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.  In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.  A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day‚Äôs drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.  According to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.  Tesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023.

[Best time for investing for dollar cost averaging,;,; I am just getting into the stock market as a 21 year old. I have an income of 30,000 per year working as a retail manager and I want to build smart habits for investing and I want some advice on investing. My main question is how should I do dollar cost averaging. Should I invest biweekly, weekly, monthly and what portion of my salary should I allocate to my roth ira. I currently only want to invest in my roth account. Is this a good idea. Any advice is appreciated. This is my current bi-weekly investing portfolio. This amounts to about about 720 per year with dollar cost averaging bi-weekly and I have about 300 in cash when there are dips that I want to buy. Is this smart?  qqqm - 34  smh - 5  arkb -8  ivv - 5  SMPO -5  NVDA - 3,;,; 2024-02-06 17:02:07]

[(4/10) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,;,; # Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, April 10th, 2023-  *****  # [S&amp;P 500 futures decline to start the week as investors‚Äô recession fears grow: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html) ***** &gt; S&amp;P 500 futures declined on Monday, as investors looked ahead to key inflation data and the start of first-quarter earnings season. ***** &gt; Futures tied to the broad market S&amp;P 500 fell 0.18%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures was little changed. Nasdaq 100 futures shed 0.49%. ***** &gt; On Thursday, the major averages rose to end a holiday-shortened trading week. However, only the Dow notched a weekly gain of 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posted weekly losses, ending lower by 0.1% and 1.1%, respectively. ***** &gt; The market was volatile as economic data showed signs of a weakening labor market. The March jobs report on Friday showed a resilient economy and moderate inflation, however, which pushed stock futures and Treasury yields higher. The New York Stock Exchange was closed for Good Friday. ***** &gt; Nonfarm payrolls grew by 236,000 for the month, about in line with the Dow Jones estimate of 238,000, the Labor Department reported. The unemployment fell to 3.5%, against expectations that it would hold from the previous month at 3.6%. ***** &gt; Investors are in for a busy week of economic data, including the latest consumer price index and producer price index data ‚Äì due out Wednesday and Thursday, respectively ‚Äì which will be key in determining if or when the Fed will pause or put an end to its rate hiking campaign. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúOur guess is the equity market needs economic Goldilocks, a bit of slowing to continue to cool inflation expectations, but not too much to spark ‚Äòhard landing‚Äô fears,‚Äù Raymond James‚Äô Tavis C. McCourt wrote in a Sunday note. ***** &gt; They‚Äôll also get the first batch of companies reporting first-quarter financial results. Tilray Brands kicks things off Monday. The major banks ‚Äì JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup ‚Äì will report on Friday.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/SEGLNbJ.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)  *****  #LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fo5yQPQ.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oGtJCdb.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XEuYACg.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/geev0Gp.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$DAL $JPM $UNH $GBX $KMX $TLRY $C $WFC $ACI $IMBI $PGR $PNC $BLK $FAST $INFY $APOG $BYRN $RENT $OGI $WAFD $CGNT $LAKE $THTX $SPWH $UXIN $SKIL $NTIC $SBEV $LVMUY*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/LlMOBkG.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*N/A.*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Exopf5u.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ojM0x2d.png)**)  *****  #FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/3Oj5wvD.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ccB4NYr.png)**)  *****  #FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/MV6TA8c.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/G5ZagLi.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:  * BUD * TSLA * GFAI * NVAX * PXD * TSM * MDU * AAPL * STWD * ASX  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/10/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-mu-pxd-tsla.html)**)  *****  &gt; **Micron Technology** ‚Äì Shares jumped more than 6% following news that Samsung Electronics plans to cut memory chip production near term.

[Tesla stock extends record streak to 13 sessions,;,;    Tesla (TSLA) shares jumped 3.6% today, extending the company‚Äôs record winning streak to 13 sessions in a row. In that time, shares have risen nearly 42%, adding further gains to an already big year for Tesla shareholders.  Tesla stock is rising in tandem with the overall market today on cooling inflation data, but the shares have been on the rise for a couple of weeks now. The latest big news came late last week when General Motors (GM) announced it was joining forces with Tesla to leverage the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger Network. The companies announced the Tesla Supercharger Network will be open to GM EV drivers starting next year, and by 2025 GM anticipates its EVs will include Tesla‚Äôs NACs connector, which will allow for direct access to Tesla Superchargers.  GM‚Äôs move comes two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/1w6kuajo6x5b1.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=432dcf945e44992a93a5f77cd6e5c1e0bb36436c  Nonetheless, it hasn‚Äôt all been good news for Tesla during the recent run-up, as the stock brushed aside negative reports about the upcoming and highly anticipated Cybertruck. Per leaked internal documents that German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on, as picked up by Wired, Tesla engineers have had some big concerns about the Cybertruck‚Äôs capabilities.  Preproduction ‚Äúalpha‚Äù versions of the Cybertruck were struggling with basic issues like suspension, body sealing, noise levels, handling, and braking, Wired reports. An automotive engineer Wired spoke with said a company like Tesla has the financial resources to address the issues, but the engineer was still ‚Äúastounded‚Äù that Tesla was struggling with some basic engineering issues with the Cybertruck.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk has nonetheless promised the company will hold a Cybertruck delivery event later in Q3, with limited production volumes beginning later this year.,;,; 2023-06-14 05:37:26]

 &amp;#x200B;  Of course, it starts with understanding Tesla -  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/jgop2vtosloa1.png?width=1039&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17a8da5736bfe9e930a40fb054e6afeeb81979d7  &amp;#x200B;  Tesla's businesses are: electric vehicles, energy storage, solar energy, etc.  &amp;#x200B;  Among them, according to the financial data of Q4 22: total revenue of 24.3 billion, 21.3 billion ($) in automotive revenue, accounting for 87.65%.  &amp;#x200B;  And, Tesla electric car price cuts swept the world.  &amp;#x200B;  So, of course, we have to start our research with electric cars.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Here, to say one of my preconceived ideas when I started my research -  &amp;#x200B;  I always thought that Tesla selling cars is just a layout, like a big game, through the sale of cars to self-driving FSD software services to thousands of households is its ultimate goal.  &amp;#x200B;  After all, the software subscription and FSD gross margin straight up to 90%.  &amp;#x200B;  Currently Tesla's main revenue from electric vehicles is through the model series, as well as electric trucks and electric pickups.  &amp;#x200B;  In the future, Tesla is expected to launch a $10w class of electric vehicles to capture the low-end market and increase market share.  &amp;#x200B;  According to the distribution of Tesla's global revenue, it is as follows.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Currently it is dominated by the United States market, which is almost a clean sweep.  &amp;#x200B;  The Chinese market is growing rapidly and has become Tesla's second major battleground, but to be honest, it is also the strongest smoke and mirrors.  &amp;#x200B;  Of course, although the auto market is a competitive place, new energy vehicles are undoubtedly full of promise.  &amp;#x200B;  Although, a while ago, the epidemic led to a downturn in consumption, but the policy -  &amp;#x200B;  on the one hand, China's and the world's carbon-neutral carbon summits have continued to make new energy look good.  &amp;#x200B;  On the other hand, Shanghai continues to subsidize the replacement of new energy vehicles, giving 1W financial subsidy for replacement - may be the national wind vane to promote new energy.  &amp;#x200B;  At the same time, Musk also offered up his big killers: price cuts.  &amp;#x200B;  Outsiders see the fun, insiders see the doorway.  &amp;#x200B;  Behind this is still because of Tesla's scale advantage, and in the entire automotive industry unmatched \[high gross profit\].  &amp;#x200B;  Tesla's price reduction magic weapon, spread out to see, there are.  &amp;#x200B;  4680 large cylindrical battery technology, super factory, integrated die-casting technology automotive design (compressed inventory turnover days), parts supply localization, and the industry's Moore's Law + Wright's Law.  &amp;#x200B;  Note: These technologies will be explained in detail later in the article.  &amp;#x200B;  All this makes both traditional car companies and new car makers look beyond their reach.  &amp;#x200B;  Even the most responsive market "electric three idiots" -  &amp;#x200B;  Xiaopeng gross profit margin of 12.2%, Azera 13.6%, the ideal maximum 18.9%.  &amp;#x200B;  And in the first three quarters of 2022 operating losses Azera 8.9 billion yuan, Xiaopeng 6.2 billion yuan, the ideal 3.5 billion yuan.  &amp;#x200B;  And Tesla's gross margin, even with price cuts, has always been controlled at more than 25% -  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  So, he still has the bottom of the price cut.  &amp;#x200B;  Thus, looking around, Tesla's competitors seem to be left with BYD.  &amp;#x200B;  About who is competing with BYD to the next article, here is a brief summary of Tesla and my concerns so far.  &amp;#x200B;  Tesla's previous strategy is: high-end sports car cut into the market, and then take the market through model 3 mass production.  &amp;#x200B;  This is undoubtedly the right thing to do.  &amp;#x200B;  In the future, Tesla may want to sell cars to occupy the terminal, and then through software subscriptions and other Apple-like model long bound users - all this is happening, but the ultimate feasibility has yet to be verified.  &amp;#x200B;  While Tesla has seen its stock and sales rise in tandem by cutting prices, at the same time, Tesla's market share is declining year after year, both globally and in China and the United States.  &amp;#x200B;  Tesla's main rival in China, BYD, has seen its market share rise from 19.5% in 2021 to 31.7%, while Tesla's market share has fallen from 10.7% to 7.8% over the same period, according to data from the Passenger Association. .  Tesla's U.S. market share 79% (20 years), 71% (21 years), 65% (22 years Q3).  S&amp;P Global Automotive forecasts that by 2025, the number of U.S. electric vehicle models is expected to increase from the current 48 to 159, and Tesla's electric vehicle market share will fall to below 20%.  Perhaps, Tesla can control its gross margin, but market share is up to itself, its competitors and most importantly, user demand, can Tesla continue to occupy the public mind?  &amp;#x200B;  At the same time, although the price cut boosted sales at the moment, but the loss is the company's long-term competitive advantage and brand reputation.  &amp;#x200B;  For example, due to Tesla price cut old users rights, and the original high-end customer base are embarrassed to drive Tesla, instead of driving their old Mercedes-Benz or old BMW ......  &amp;#x200B;  Suddenly remembered Reid Hoffman in the "lightning expansion" there is a sentence -  &amp;#x200B;  The so-called entrepreneurship is the process of falling off a cliff in the rapid formation of parts into an aircraft that can be lifted.  &amp;#x200B;  The sense of urgency in this jumped off the page.  &amp;#x200B;  And Tesla, despite its nearly 20-year history, is still running rapidly, in order to continue to leave the competition, in order to replace the existing car ownership market of more than a billion, in order to Musk's "use of clean energy to continue human development" retroactive ......  &amp;#x200B;  That's all for today's analysis.

S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures rose marginally. ***** &gt; The Dow closed nearly 575 points lower on Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 slid 1.53% to close below the key 4,000 threshold, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.25%. The sharp decline for stocks was accompanied by a spike in bond yields, with the rate on the 2-year Treasury surpassing 5% and touching the highest level since 2007. ***** &gt; The shakeup in markets came after Fed Chair Powell spoke before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.

Chevron is set to give the index a boost as it gained 4.5% in pre-market trading on the spike in oil prices. ***** &gt; The output cut from OPEC+, which is slashing 1.16 million barrels per day, sent oil prices soaring. West Texas Intermediate crude was 6.6% higher, while international benchmark Brent crude climbed 6%. ***** &gt; Traders are shedding optimism from recent market strength with the prospect of higher oil prices adding to fears of higher inflation and a looming recession. ***** &gt; The Energy Select Sector SPDR fund (XLE), which tracks the S&amp;P 500 energy sector, also popped more than 3% in the premarket. Marathon Oil and Halliburton were the fund‚Äôs best performers, rising more than 6% each. ***** &gt; All three major averages were positive in the first quarter, despite turmoil in the banking sector highlighted by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March. The Nasdaq Composite led the way in the quarter with a gain of 16.8% while the S&amp;P 500 rose 7% in the first three months of the year for its second-straight positive quarter. The Dow industrials lagged but still managed to grind out an advance of 0.4%. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúFor now at least, tech is seen as a safe haven of all things, immune to the news in banking. The S&amp;P 500, in turn, seems held together by its own heavy weighting in tech, names like Microsoft, Apple and the like,‚Äù Wellington Shields technical analyst Frank Gretz said in a note to clients. ***** &gt; The first week of the new quarter is a shortened one for Wall Street, as trading will be closed for Good Friday. However, there will be several key pieces of economic data for investors, including job openings data on Tuesday, ADP private payrolls report on Wednesday and the closely watched monthly jobs report on Friday.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/11eXFpo.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)  *****  #LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GEv6A54.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/JpIs9Gp.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/0v7CXuP.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/DPM9cgs.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$SAIC $CAG $LW $AYI $STZ $FLGC $MSM $OCX $DLO $RPM $LEVI $SMPL $LNN $APLD $SCHN $EGY $IONM $KRUS $GNLN $SGH $RELL $WDFC $FRLN $SNAX $ZENV $CLIR $RGP $SLP $SDRL $NG*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5Y8HITW.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$EAST $SAIC $WLMS $FLGC $FSI $OCX $VTSI $IONM $MIRO $ELBM $TIVC*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/60PjWGG.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/r4mgY1P.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**) (NONE.)  *****  #FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES!](https://i.imgur.com/KLDbdZx.png)**)  *****  #FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/QpUPAM6.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/XEOeE5N.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2kuKJ0T.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:  * TSLA * SOFI * AI * OXY * WWE * BUD * GFAI * CLF * ANVS * CRSP  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/03/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-mro-m-wwe-and-more.html)**)  *****  &gt; **Energy stocks** ‚Äî Energy stocks rose broadly Monday after OPEC surprised the market by announcing a production cut.

[Summary of recent news, and the impact on U.S. stocks,;,;  **U.S. March nonfarm payrolls data mixed, leaving door open for another Fed rate hike in May**  U.S. nonfarm payrolls growth slowed to 236,000 in March, below expectations of 239,000 and the smallest increase since December 2020.  The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, compared with a forecast of 3.6 percent. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% from a year earlier, compared with a forecast of 0.3%.  With the release of the nonfarm payrolls data, one of the Fed's two most closely watched indicators - employment and inflation - firmed, U.S. bond yields lifted across the board, and the swap agreement showed the Fed's next FOMC meeting in May with another 25 basis point rate hike probability of about 75%.  **Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Summers: U.S. recession possibility rises, Fed nears end of rate hike**  Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Summers said the Fed is coming to the end of interest rate hikes after a series of weak economic indicators were released and the possibility of a U.S. recession is on the rise. Commenting on the Fed's May rate meeting, Summers said it is clear that we are in the final stages of the current tightening cycle. Whether it is necessary to take action again, I think this is a judgment they should wait until the last minute.  **Hedge funds: the Fed policy is about to turn, the dollar may depreciate 15% in a year and a half**  British hedge fund Eurizon SLJ Capital released a report saying that the dollar could fall another 10 to 15 percent in the next year and a half as inflation cools and the Federal Reserve is about to ease monetary policy. Stephen Jen, the firm's chief executive, said the Fed may be very close to or may even have crossed the peak of its hawkish stance, and that means a rate cut is coming.  **Bank of America: How OPEC + Production Cuts Impacted April CPI Data**  Bank of America said the impact of the Opec + voluntary production cuts on the economy and monetary policy is likely to be fairly small. That's despite headlines that it adds to an already complicated outlook for rate hikes, creating upside risks for inflation and Fed policy. But the bank sees it differently. Bofa thinks Opec's production cuts should create a small upside risk to inflation and a small downside risk to growth. Even if oil prices remain at current levels, the energy CPI component of the April CPI report is likely to decline slightly, as the lagged impact of earlier declines in oil prices outweighed Monday's gains.  **Undeterred by the banking crisis, individual investors in U.S. stocks still plunge into bank stocks**  Despite the ongoing crisis in the U.S. banking sector, the market still has doubts about the outlook for the banking sector and the U.S. economy, but U.S. retail investors continued to plunge into hard-hit bank stocks in the first quarter, pumping money into heavyweight stocks such as U.S. banks.

And just one month has passed since the last time Tesla cut prices in the United States. The price of both versions of the Model 3 was cut by $1,000, the price of the two existing Model Y models was cut by $2,000, and the Model S and Model X were each cut by $5,000. In addition, Tesla has officially launched a new, less expensive Model Y with AWD powertrain in the U.S., priced at $49,990.  **ExxonMobil reportedly in talks to buy shale oil giant Pioneer Natural Resources**  ExxonMobil ([XOM.US](https://xom.us/))$ has entered into preliminary informal discussions to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources ([PXD.US](https://pxd.us/))$, the top-ranked independent oil producer and shale oil production giant in the United States, media said Friday, April 7, citing sources familiar with the matter.

[Stock Market Today (as of Mar 15, 2023),;,; Last night, the three major US stock indexes fluctuated and closed higher, with regional banks rebounding and semiconductors leading the market. At the close, the Dow Jones rose 1.06%, the Nasdaq rose 2.14%, and the S&amp;P rose 1.65%.  The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds rose 3.754% to close at 3.676%, with a spread of -56 basis points compared to the yield on 2-year Treasury bonds. The VIX fell 10.52%, Brent crude oil fell 3.78%, and spot gold has been on an upward trend since November 2022, but it fell 0.51% yesterday to $1903.8/ounce.

The US CPI has risen steadily in February due to the high cost of rent, with a month-on-month increase of 0.4% and a year-on-year increase of 6.0%, which is in line with expectations. There is uncertainty among economists as to whether the increase in inflation will be enough to push the Fed to raise interest rates again next week, especially after the bankruptcy of two regional banks. Some economists, including Goldman Sachs, predict that the Fed will pause the current fast monetary policy tightening cycle since the 1980s to avoid the spread of the banking crisis, while financial markets still expect the Fed to raise interest rates by 25 basis points. CME's "Fed Watch" reflects the mixed opinions among economists regarding the Fed's next move.

The US government has notified its allies and is in direct communication with Russian officials to express its opposition to the incident.

The Russian side denies the allegations and claims that the drone was not deliberately targeted and lost control due to a sudden maneuver.  **Trending Stocks**  [**First Republic Bank(FRC)**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-FRC/)  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/3fmgnwrjcwna1.png?width=1213&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cf10c45463b17c7161f5bad6e076166c2ef04c3  FRC, which was down 61.83% on Monday, was up nearly 28% yesterday, and traded up another 8.45% in the post-market.

[Daily Trading Report üö®,;,; Good morning and happy Tuesday! I hope you all have had a wonderful long weekend and are feeling well rested going into this short week!      Short weeks have typically net us extremely profitable opportunities to both invest and trade, but the current market conditions are different and are providing us with false hopes and optimism that I‚Äôve been stating needs to be crushed. At the moment on the fear &amp; greed index, we are still at greed, which shows that the general sentiment on the market is still optimistic. This is either a bias confirmation of a reversal, or a sign that we are about to get wiped out.      Historically, the end of February is an extremely bearish time for the markets though, so please be on the look out. Please be extremely careful when attempting to allocate long into the markets and practice safe risk management when you are actively scalping &amp; day trading not only today, but for the rest of the month. As long as you are able to stay solvent while the markets are acting irrationally, you will be set to allocate when the markets are at its relative bottom and capitalize on the general fear and lack of liquidity the average trader will have.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, March the 21st, 2023-  *****  # [Stock futures rise as Wall Street tries to build on Monday‚Äôs rally, regional banks jump: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/20/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)  ***** &gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday as traders tried to add to a rally from the previous session that was sparked by hope that the banking turmoil would be contained. ***** &gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 382 points, or 1.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures also climbed 0.9%, while Nasdaq-100 futures were up 0.3%. ***** &gt; Regional banks surged in early trading, led by First Republic. The beaten-down bank jumped 21.9%, a day after losing 47%. The SPDR Regional Banking ETF (KRE) gained 3%. Regionals got a boost after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday morning that the government is ready to provide further guarantees of deposits if the banking crisis worsens. ***** &gt; Wall Street is coming off a strong rally, with the Dow surging more than 380 points Monday, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.9%. The action came a day after a forced takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, which was engineered by the Swiss government. Investors also welcomed news that JPMorgan Chase could be advising embattled First Republic Bank on strategic alternatives. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúBank selling appears exhausted and it would take the emergence of fresh deposit problems at a new name to bring out incremental supply, although there‚Äôs very little interest to step in and buy the group, especially the regionals,‚Äù Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, said in a note. ***** &gt; Investors now expect a slower pace of tightening from the Federal Reserve in light of the banking crisis. Traders now are pricing in a 83% chance of a quarter-point rate hike when the Fed wraps its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, according to CME Group‚Äôs FedWatch tool. The probability of a pause is at 16.6%. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúRisks of contagion are rising and could push the Fed to pause the current rate hiking cycle, although this is not our base case,‚Äù said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. ‚ÄúThe Fed will likely signal they are near the end of their rate hiking campaign as recession risks increase and inflation pressures decrease.‚Äù  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/zigPsfW.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WuDZYIS.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/o4kZQFT.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/73vXuqs.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/kkUKWxH.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$PDD $ARRY $NKE $FL $GME $CSIQ $TME $CHWY $GIS $ACN $NIU $RVLP $WOOF $DRI $DOYU $ONON $ADMA $FDS $BZ $BRAG $AIR $KBH $DOOO $GAMB $CMC $EXPR $OLLI $HQY $BITF $ACDC $NVGS $HRTX $HUYA $AEVA $CTRN $WGO $LLAP $OXSQ $SMTI $XFOR $PHUN $SPPI $BZUN $EXAI $WVE $PHR $HYPR $KULR $XGN $SCVL*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/JxG6hIn.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$CSIQ $TME $ONON $BRAG $SMTI $XGN $CTRN $BITF $HUYA $ACDC $OXSG $LLAP $LTRN $XFOR $LMDX $INKT $DFLI*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/1Kr44Qi.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ao5glH6.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/kUQisGv.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5PQzaqI.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3obokzF.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/vgSfydY.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nqwy9QE.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/upDXKH8.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:  * FRC * DWAC * ALT * JPM * CSIQ * ONON * PLUG * DJIA * VIGL * NASDAQ  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/21/stocks-making-the-biggest-premarket-moves-.html)**)  *****  &gt; **Tesla** ‚Äî The electric vehicle maker rose 2% after Moody‚Äôs assigned it a Baa3 rating and removed its junk-rated credit.

Additionally, I'm hearing throughout the ward that Mondays are typically good for calls! I'm excited because I should be \*very popular\* today!  Maybe that is why one of my siblings (the SPY 390 Put) looks so despondent. But, I think I‚Äôd prefer spending the time ahead of the open (when they unleash us on the world) with 390P (I‚Äôll use our code names, since saying the expiration date over and over is redundant, and quite frankly, a bit depressing). Anyways, let‚Äôs move on.  BTW, **I‚Äôm already annoyed by 400C**. Literally it is out there strutting around knowing that it will probably be the most popular one of us right out of the gates. It‚Äôs almost embarrassing, at least to me, that there is literally an entourage of 0DTE hanging around 400C sharing in its spotlight!  The waiting for the open is getting a bit tedious!  Also, I‚Äôve got to admit, I‚Äôm getting a little freaked out by some of the noises coming from the next room. We don‚Äôt know for sure, but supposedly there are some things called ‚Äúweekly‚Äù options being born over there! I‚Äôm more scared than jealous because who wants to live a week in obscurity, which most of them will do, when you can have it all in one glorious day! I‚Äôm really getting excited for my potential today!  There are rumblings that something called a TSLA March 3rd 200 Call is a real bully! Pushing and shoving the rest of the weekly‚Äôs out of the way along with their little gang of 200 Puts/210 Calls (which apparently hang out in every new generation). The only group over there that even seems willing to stand up to the TSLA gang, at least consistently, is the VIX Call group. I‚Äôm not even sure what a VIX Call is or does (it isn‚Äôt a stock ticker that I know of), but supposedly it could provide some stiff competition for me ‚Äì though mostly on down days and today looks like an up day!  ùë´ùíäùíèùíà, ùíÖùíäùíèùíà, ùíÖùíäùíèùíà!  There is the bell, we are off and running!  Hmmm, a disappointing start for me. Seeing a bunch of puts crop up in the ‚Äúmost active‚Äù section to start the day. 390P is actually the second most active contract out there. Wow, good thing I was friendly before the open! It is also very early and I am seeing things like XLE and even HYG high on the list. Whatever you think about the high yield bond market, HYG is NOT likely to stay that active (especially since it contains longer-dated options) and the 0DTE family will rule the day!  ùëªùíÇùíåùíÜ ùíïùíâùíÇùíï!  I‚Äôm up to the number 10 most traded! Yeehaw, I‚Äôm POPULAR!  Yeah, yeah, ‚ÄúMr. Fancy Pants‚Äù 400C is number one, but what can I do about that! You know what seems crazy is that option, which started this morning around 50 cents, is already worth $1.3! What a return! And open interest is only 13,500 contracts compared to a traded volume of 77,000. On Bloomberg you can find vega, delta, and other ‚ÄúGreeks‚Äù for this option, which is cute, but largely irrelevant! Theta, or "time decay" is 0, since we expire today! Kind of funny to see N.A. beside such an important option metric, but we are more like betting chits than options!  Ugh, don‚Äôt look now, but looks like someone just bought a lot of 0DTE puts!  The 390P is now trading at 1 cent, down from 23 cents! But, let‚Äôs be honest, who is buying or selling that here? Yet it is now the 2nd most active contract.  ùë®ùíìùíÜ ùíïùíâùíÜ ùíëùíñùíï ùíÉùíñùíöùíÜùíìùíî ùíàùíêùíäùíèùíà ùíïùíê ùíÖùíìùíÇùíà ùíÖùíêùíòùíè ùíïùíâùíÜ ùíéùíÇùíìùíåùíÜùíï ùíêùíì ùíäùíî ùíÇùíè ùíñùíëùíîùíäùíÖùíÜ ùíàùíÇùíéùíéùíÇ ùíîùííùíñùíÜùíÜùíõùíÜ ùíîùíïùíäùíçùíç ùíäùíè ùíïùíâùíÜ ùíÑùíÇùíìùíÖùíî?  It‚Äôs 11am ET, right around the time everyone gets excited about how the market will behave when ‚ÄúEurope goes home‚Äù.  The top 8 options traded, by volume, are all SPY Puts and Calls. I‚Äôm sitting at number 4, and anything could happen. The ‚Äúleaderboard‚Äù is 399P, 400P, 400C (it would be better for markets if this was leading, but I really don‚Äôt like this 0DTE for some reason ‚Äì must have been the pre-market arrogance), 401C (yours truly!), 402C, 398P, 403C, and 397P.  ùíÄùíÇùíòùíè...

If anything, I‚Äôd watch that sneaky little 401C because something tells me that one is a ‚Äúgamer‚Äù and could make a strong charge at the end. Also, poor little 390P has all but disappeared.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, March the 2nd, 2023-  *****  # [S&amp;P 500 futures fall Thursday as rates march higher: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/01/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)  ***** &gt; S&amp;P 500 futures slid Thursday, as traders fretted over a continued rise in interest rates. ***** &gt; Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 fell 0.5%, while Nasdaq-100 futures dropped 0.8%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures bucked the trend, eking out a small gain as Salesforce shares popped on a strong quarter and forward guidance. ***** &gt; Along with Salesforce, Okta shares jumped in overnight trading on solid earnings and guidance. Silvergate Capital, meanwhile, shares plunged more than 30%, after the company delayed its 10-K annual report. ***** &gt; Tesla shares, popular with retail investors, lost 5% after the company failed to unveil details of any next-generation vehicles during its much-anticipated investor day Wednesday. The decline put pressure on S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures. ***** &gt; Rates, meanwhile, pressed higher, with the benchmark 10-year note yield trading above 4%. The 2-year note yield reached levels not seen in more than a decade. ***** &gt; Wall Street is coming off a mixed session, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite falling Wednesday, while the Dow posted a small gain. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are on pace for their second consecutive losing week for the first time since December. The Dow, meanwhile, is on track for its fifth consecutive negative week, a first since May 2022. ***** &gt; The rise in bond yields and concerns of a potentially larger-than-expected hike from the Federal Reserve have fueled investor concern in recent days, putting a dent in the early 2023 rally. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúYou have a situation where if rates stay high, multiples need to come in, and it likely leads to a further downfall down the line in the economy because there is a lag effect to these rate hikes,‚Äù Cantor Fitzgerald‚Äôs Eric Johnston said on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell: Overtime‚Äù on Wednesday. ‚ÄúAnd then once the economy falls, then earnings would have a fairly long way to go to the downside.‚Äù ***** &gt; On the economic front, investors await jobless claims, and unit labor costs and productivity data. A speech from Fed Governor Christopher Waller is also slated for Thursday afternoon.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/4hEG093.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/o8YKWeI.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/0gVewPm.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/GnheTqO.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/fLFMftl.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$NIO $FUBO $WEN $NCLH $TGT $OXY $BRK.B $RIVN $LI $AMC $CRM $SNOW $ZM $PLUG $NAT $LOW $COST $VTRS $AZO $CLOV $BBY $WDAY $DLTR $AI $PBR $AXSM $FSR $FREY $CHPT $MARA $KOS $M $KR $OKTA $SPLK $BXSL $TREE $GLP $FSLR $NVAX $AAP $BGNE $MKSI $FRPT $KSS $MRVL $ZS $BLNK $CELH $AVGO*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/eI3bc4K.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$BBY $KR $M $BIG $BUD $BILI $BURL $ARBE $TD $HRL $SIX $PTLO $ARGX $AER $CMRX $SFM $TGLS $CNQ $ABUS $GMS $AMRX $UTZ $SOHO $WHF $CPG $PDCO $CRAI $EXK $ICD $SSYS $STER $ICPT $EYPT $MCS $STGW $STVN $SYRS $UPH $SELB $OB $CCLD $CLMB $GECC*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/KOKBS4C.jpg)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/80vFgcF.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bhctMah.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ywHJL2B.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/vRqLqBw.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/NvBz5zo.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/M0rJCqO.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/g3iTa61.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4GTH7uc.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/tK3Gjiz.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/7osLf40.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:  * SI * TSLA * LKNCY * PSNY * CRM * PLUG * SNOW * OKTA * CDIO * M  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/02/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-before-the-bell-crm-bby-m-and-more.html)**)  *****  &gt; **Salesforce** ‚Äî Shares of the cloud software maker soared nearly 16% in premarket after the company beat Wall Street estimates across the board in its latest earnings report and issued a better-than-expected forecast.

[Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&amp;P 500 gains,;,; = just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing =  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023  [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9)  &amp;#x200B;  The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&amp;P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.  &amp;#x200B;  It‚Äôs an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inflation battle, noted FactSet‚Äôs Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 top performing days for the S&amp;P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday‚Äôs close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%.  &amp;#x200B;  Through Dec. 22, the S&amp;P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&amp;P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.  &amp;#x200B;  Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&amp;P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  That didn‚Äôt mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.  &amp;#x200B;  Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.  &amp;#x200B;  Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.  &amp;#x200B;  The strategy ‚Äúindicates the Fed‚Äôs measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,‚Äù Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&amp;P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks‚Äô bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group‚Äôs announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.  &amp;#x200B;  SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a ‚Äúmini‚Äù banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.  &amp;#x200B;  Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks ‚Äî Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%,  and Meta Platforms Inc.  META, 0.56%.  &amp;#x200B;  See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?  &amp;#x200B;  Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high:  &amp;#x200B;  The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs overall return, he wrote, with the company‚Äôs success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.,;,; 2023-12-27 15:52:27]

[Tesla stock dips as analysts warn price cuts will weigh on margins,;,;    Tesla ($TSLA) shares are moving lower in premarket Monday after the electric vehicle (EV) maker delivered the fifth series of price cuts since January.  According to the company‚Äôs website, Tesla slashed prices on the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover by $1,000 and $2,000, respectively. The EV maker also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000.  ‚ÄúWe continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds, including Model S/X vehicles in transit to EMEA and APAC,‚Äù the company said in a press release.  The cuts come after Tesla said it delivered nearly 423,000 EV units in the first quarter. Several media outlets have reported that the company‚Äôs internal guidance is to deliver 2M cars in 2023 while analysts expect this number to be lower by around 10%.  Tesla is due to report its Q1 results on April 19.  **What analysts are saying about price cuts**  While Tesla is attempting to reaccelerate growth by offering cars at lower prices, analysts warn that the company‚Äôs margins could be at risk. The Street sees Tesla reporting a 21.1% auto gross margin for Q1.  Wells Fargo analysts believe Tesla will miss the &gt;20% target for auto gross margins. They also see Tesla reporting lower-than-expected EPS for the first quarter. Moreover, the analysts say Tesla will need to average \~526K deliveries from Q2 to Q4 to hit its 2M target.  ‚ÄúOur estimated auto gross margin ex credits of 18.3% is below guidance of &gt;20% and Visible Alpha (VA) consensus of 21.7%. We forecast ASPs for $46K, also below TSLA's target of &gt;$47K. Our Model 3/ Y pricing is down 12% vs. Q3, below our est. avg. price cut of 14%, reflecting model &amp; trim mix help,‚Äù they said in a note.  Citi analysts add that price cuts weren‚Äôt surprising and are likely to place a further focus on the Q1 auto gross margin.  ‚ÄúA stronger-than-expected gross margin outcome would support the contention that Tesla‚Äôs latest price cuts are coming from a position of cost strength while also possibly reflecting lower input costs. An in-line/softer gross margin outcome could revive concerns over capacity/product aging while placing 2023 consensus estimates at risk since they call for improving gross margins throughout the year,‚Äù they wrote in a note.  ‚ÄúAt \~46x ‚Äò23 consensus EPS, we don‚Äôt think the latter outcome is currently priced-in, making for a less than compelling risk/reward into the quarter under the current macro backdrop. We prefer staying opportunistic.‚Äù  Finally, Bernstein analysts expect Tesla to continue cutting prices to stimulate demand.  ‚ÄúWe note that lead times were relatively weak (&lt;4 weeks) for nearly all Tesla models in all geographies, \*except\* for the Model Y in the US. The fact that Tesla is cutting price on its longest lead time model suggests other price cuts are likely to follow, particularly since Model 3 SR rebates will fall $3750 on 4/18, and competition continues to intensify."  Given that they expect more price cuts, the analysts also don‚Äôt believe that Q1 margins may be the bottom. They expect Q1 auto gross margin of 20.5%, missing the 21.1% consensus.  ‚ÄúWe maintain that price cuts have and will undermine industry profitability (including Tesla's), but that incumbents are deep pocketed and not likely to back down. Some investors maintain that Tesla's recent price cuts reflect a structural cost advantage that will enable it to pressure rivals and capture outsize volume and dominate the EV market. Ultimately, we believe that the automotive market is hyper-competitive, and very difficult for any OEM to sustain an ongoing competitive cost advantage,‚Äù they finally concluded.

[The Week Ahead: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,;,; **OVERALL**:  SPY showing the weakest chart with a potential breakdown back inside the bear channel.  IWM closed right at its bear channel ceiling, so Monday's candle could lead it into a potential breakdown as  well.  QQQ holding up the best, with at least a minor support level between current price &amp; its bear channel.  With prices sitting within so much support, probabilities would favor a bounce Monday; however, the regional bank sector crisis throws probabilities out the window.  We'll see...  &amp;#x200B;  **SPY**:  Potential breakdown back inside the bear channel; the prices to watch are a close below 384.32 -- or -- a close above 389.30 -- that will officially determine the breakdown (or not).  If a breakdown, major resistance is the 368.79 level of convergence between double bottom and COVID ascending TL.  If not a breakdown, then major resistance would be around 423.50 as price would be moving within a bullish parallel channel.  https://preview.redd.it/4zwua06636na1.jpg?width=2390&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66b3cd5696ea7d15103b6e354f80fb876aaa79d6  **QQQ**:  Price closed below the 50 + 200 DMA necktie, but just above 283.98 convergence of 100 DMA and ascending TL off the Oct 2022 lows; probabilities suggest this level will need to be tagged and therefore could see more downside early next week to hit this level.  Major support remains down at 270 former bear channel ceiling; aforementioned levels are just minor support.  First resistnace is 301.70 descending TL from the early Feb 2023 pivot high.  Major resistance is now 334.42 (now longer the 311 triple top) as the down move we are seeing could technically be all inside bar, bullish consolidation from the Dec 2022 to Feb 2023 up move.  The bull case is unlikely, given the events of this past week, but nevertheless worth mentioning because the chart is the chart, after all.  https://preview.redd.it/uef8bwbp26na1.jpg?width=2391&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c812e038fc80d1f9ff07c4511eb332274f29c8b  **IWM**: Price fell &amp; closed into major support; probabilities would suggest a multi-day/week bounce from this level, ***but*** the SVB collapse, &amp; weakness across the entire regional banking sector as a result, certainly cannot be ignored.  If downside continues, 170 should provide some support, but the next major level is 162.76 - 160.40 where triple bottom &amp; an ascending long term TL converge.  Any bounce would see first resistance at 181.45 (gap-fill and 200 DMA), as well as 187 -- major resistance is 197 - 202 (ascending long term TL and double top).  https://preview.redd.it/4vz4n1ga16na1.jpg?width=2391&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=019ae8993a9122ba41f6c6e453b64c1c439b4481  &amp;#x200B;  I will play a lot of catch up here since it's been over a month since my posting (work &amp; life have a tendency to do that).

The EV maker also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000.  ‚ÄúWe continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds, including Model S/X vehicles in transit to EMEA and APAC,‚Äù the company said in a press release.  The cuts come after Tesla said it delivered nearly 423,000 EV units in the first quarter. Several media outlets have reported that the company‚Äôs internal guidance is to deliver 2M cars in 2023 while analysts expect this number to be lower by around 10%.  Tesla is due to report its Q1 results on April 19.  **What analysts are saying about price cuts**  While Tesla is attempting to reaccelerate growth by offering cars at lower prices, analysts warn that the company‚Äôs margins could be at risk. The Street sees Tesla reporting a 21.1% auto gross margin for Q1.  Wells Fargo analysts believe Tesla will miss the &gt;20% target for auto gross margins. They also see Tesla reporting lower-than-expected EPS for the first quarter. Moreover, the analysts say Tesla will need to average \~526K deliveries from Q2 to Q4 to hit its 2M target.  ‚ÄúOur estimated auto gross margin ex credits of 18.3% is below guidance of &gt;20% and Visible Alpha (VA) consensus of 21.7%. We forecast ASPs for $46K, also below TSLA's target of &gt;$47K. Our Model 3/ Y pricing is down 12% vs. Q3, below our est. avg. price cut of 14%, reflecting model &amp; trim mix help,‚Äù they said in a note.  Citi analysts add that price cuts weren‚Äôt surprising and are likely to place a further focus on the Q1 auto gross margin.  ‚ÄúA stronger-than-expected gross margin outcome would support the contention that Tesla‚Äôs latest price cuts are coming from a position of cost strength while also possibly reflecting lower input costs. An in-line/softer gross margin outcome could revive concerns over capacity/product aging while placing 2023 consensus estimates at risk since they call for improving gross margins throughout the year,‚Äù they wrote in a note.  ‚ÄúAt \~46x ‚Äò23 consensus EPS, we don‚Äôt think the latter outcome is currently priced-in, making for a less than compelling risk/reward into the quarter under the current macro backdrop. We prefer staying opportunistic.‚Äù  Finally, Bernstein analysts expect Tesla to continue cutting prices to stimulate demand.  ‚ÄúWe note that lead times were relatively weak (&lt;4 weeks) for nearly all Tesla models in all geographies, \*except\* for the Model Y in the US. The fact that Tesla is cutting price on its longest lead time model suggests other price cuts are likely to follow, particularly since Model 3 SR rebates will fall $3750 on 4/18, and competition continues to intensify."  Given that they expect more price cuts, the analysts also don‚Äôt believe that Q1 margins may be the bottom. They expect Q1 auto gross margin of 20.5%, missing the 21.1% consensus.  ‚ÄúWe maintain that price cuts have and will undermine industry profitability (including Tesla's), but that incumbents are deep pocketed and not likely to back down. Some investors maintain that Tesla's recent price cuts reflect a structural cost advantage that will enable it to pressure rivals and capture outsize volume and dominate the EV market. Ultimately, we believe that the automotive market is hyper-competitive, and very difficult for any OEM to sustain an ongoing competitive cost advantage,‚Äù they finally concluded.

[Best way to minimise our losses as a retail trader ‚Ä¶,;,; In this post i will try point out some of my experiences from the years of trading in the equity market, how we all retail traders can minimize our losses via just implementing 4 different ideas in your trading style so we can have the edge over others and how we can intellectually find some good trades.// please feel free to add your ideas , strategies how you trade, your principles of trading and give me suggestion in the comments if I wrote something wrong   1.ATTITUDE- First of all ,what's trading its prediction right ,in every trade don‚Äôt try to be expert don‚Äôt try to predict every hour , every day, every week in the market its nearly impossible to catch the obvious moves, because generally everybody knows it and it is already priced in the asset price. You should know what to stake and when to take a loss. Always think markets are supreme and never say I was right and market is wrong otherwise you will never learn. My golden rule in trading is "following the momentum" price is the first indicator which will tell you ,you are wrong instantly exit from your position with the small loss. Always remember this quote "you have to loose many battles to win a war" don't be emotionally connected to a trade    2. TECHNIQUE-You should know know your trading technique, way better than anyone else lets take the common example of option strategy if you think your bullish,exactly how much bullish you are and what strategy suits you either it is debit call spread to cut your cost for entry but never feel greedy or fearful about any trade because you have to leave your emotions at home when you are competing with the heavy hedge funds and high net worth traders which want to suck your money out of your veins and wanna try to bankrupt you ,it seems so obvious but i have seem shit tone of post people screaming about what to do next because they don't know about volatility crush,they didn't had any exit plan and they don't know what to do when your strategy backfire at you try to have a plan for example if you are playing earnings what I will do if volatility drops what i will do if the volatility increases because people don't know market don't price in 2 times on the same news. They usually see gains and they will feel euphoria because they are right and they usually don't close the position for the gains because now they are expecting more from the market which ultimately make them to loose ton of money (always trade with a stop loss)   3.UNDERSTANDING THE MARKET-the most important aspect of trading is to know what is the state of market or economy which will provide you a broad direction which is the backbone of any strategy you will imply. It is important to have a knowledge of the clear trend of the market, always keep on the eye on the upcoming events in the economy which can effect the markets major events like GDP releases , have a close look on fed decisions and it is gonna effect the markets you should be ahead of the most of the public because most of the people are too lazy to see the charts,data on time and there whole focus is to buy and selling securities without having the idea of the broad direction of the market. Always compare it with how other country's economy has affected them then you can get the idea. Other indicators such as Non-farm payrolls, inflation, dollar strength or weakness because it is gonna affect the exporting and importing companies sooner or later, the price of the crude oil can think how this gonna affect my trading companies for example cut of production in the OPEC results in the profit of the companies like ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, Pioneer Energy if you had an edge you could have reap the profit from this news.   4.FUNDAMENTALS-For me, its important to see the technical analysis of the stock price to see the future price is fine ,but having a strong grip on the fundamentals of the company always gives you an edge over the other traders who are just following the momentum for the profit or who are just buying calls or puts because they heard on CNBC that it has a huge upside and it will have a crazy earnings next quarter. If you had read the balance sheet ,income statement and cash flow right by seeing all the factors such as EPS, debt and hell lot of others. You can identify the patterns which other people cannot look upon because sometimes the business model is right company is profitable everything going good but share price is really down which will give you a advantage to make a trading decision.   But also lemme clear you one thing which is "The shares are gonna come to its mean value which is for sure but when nobody knows many had tried to short the NVIDIA and TSLA and went bankrupt because they thought its too expensive but they forgot the rule no 1 about don't go against the momentum it will kill you ,if you are not sure about the trend do go against , yes you can make a lot of money to predict a trend reversal as many of you have seen 'The big short movie" and want to become like burry so friend don't go against or at least wait until the trend turns because no one can predict the market too perfectly and it the trend is against you just square off your positions because you have already lost that trade   so guys i have gave enough meat here, I know i can be wrong so please give me your suggestion in your comment section and what to think about it  thanks.,;,; 2023-07-18 11:10:49]

[What SPX Won't Do ‚Äì Probably,;,; **SPX trade taken on 02/17/2023 based on what it will not do based on its own historical data.**  Wrote a vertical PUT 2800/2000 for 03/24/23 expiry  Quantity: 10 PUTs  Premium: $750  Portfolio Margin: $16,400  ‚ÄúOnce every 20 year‚Äù lose strike is 2830  Most, if not all, stock market analysts attempt to divine what a stock or the stock market will do in the future.  They use fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and experience to predict the direction and potential levels to be reached before a potential turning point.  We, on the other hand, analyze what a stock, bond, ETF, or index is unlikely to do in the future based upon its own historical data.  Unlike RSI, Bollinger Bands, or other technical indicators that provide similar information, our measure uses the entire stock/ETF/index trading history to determine what the stock/ETF/index is unlikely to do.    So what is it ??  We have developed a machine learning system that measures a symbols' percentage price change versus time for multiple time periods and compares the symbols recent price behavior to its own past to determine if the current behavior is anomalous.  Think of this as a measure of momentum run amok for the symbol.  Our experience has shown that there are two levels of anomalous stock/etf/index behavior that are of interest: (1) When the stock/ETF/index current performance is outside of 99% of all prior instances (this is called a Level 1 overbought or oversold condition) and, (2) When the stock/ETF/index current performance is outside the bounds of all of its prior history (this is called a Level 2 overbought or oversold condition).  We currently screen 600 stock/etf/index symbols every day - with more being added each week.  These symbols are all traded US stock market exchanges during normal US trading hours.  Figure 1, below, shows a subset of symbols screened for February 17, 2023  [Figure 1.  February 17, 2023 Stock Screener Subset](https://preview.redd.it/81mahsslvbja1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86c813183acff93467d8bcaadd6ed3b2d55b98e7)  In the first column of Figure 1, we have sets of 3 rows that have Level 1, Level 2, and Data Since labels. The Data Since rows describe the start date for each symbol associated with the date. For instance, SPX has 1/2/1962 which means that the machine learning system contains SPX data since January 2, 1962 for the computations of SPX (S&amp;P 500). Likewise, the symbol INDY has data since November 23, 2009 for its computations, etc. Next are the rows for Level 1 and Level 2. Let's look at Level 1 first. In the rows for Level 1, a number greater than or equal to 1 indicates that on a price change % versus time basis, the symbol is overbought because it moved farther to the upside and faster than 99% of all other equivalent time periods in its history. These cells are highlighted light blue in the screener data. In the rows for Level 1, a number less or equal to zero indicates that on a price change % versus time basis, the symbol is oversold because it moved farther to the downside and faster than 99% of all other equivalent time periods in its history. These cells are highlighted light red in the screener data file. Level 2 is similar to Level 1 except that instead of 99% of the history, it is 100% of the history implying the stock/ETF/index has never moved that far that fast for any equivalent period of time in the data set. Yellow highlighted cells simply highlight symbols that are near overbought or oversold on a Level 1 or Level 2 basis.  In Figure 1, we can see that TSLA screened as Level 1 overbought, AGG and BAX screened as Level 1 oversold AND UNG and SHOP as Level 1 and Level 2 oversold.  However, in this article, we are focusing on SPX (S&amp;P 500 index) as it is currently neither overbought or oversold.  Figure 2, below, shows a chart of the SPX price action over the last six months.  https://preview.redd.it/4yu1gsnsvbja1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2ce4f160ebbcc42b1f5b1b4872ba69b0fddc673  So how can we use this ??  The machine learning system that determines the overbought/oversold condition also provides threshold levels that correspond to what the symbol is unlikely to do in the FUTURE based upon where it is trading now.  Table 1, below, shows various levels and limits with different probabilities of occurrence for SPX for a subset of future dates.  [Table 1.  SPX Upper and Lower Closing Limits through March 17th, 2023](https://preview.redd.it/wux9dmq1wbja1.png?width=1034&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=658845a1338dca2254b5f8853dfbba3fe72da9f5)  In Table 1, above, we show five (5) columns corresponding to "No loss since inception", "Once Every 10 Years",  "Once Every 5 Years", ‚ÄúOnce Every 1 Years‚Äù, and "1% Raw Data".  Under each column header are sub-headers titled "Lower Limit" and "Upper Limit".  Under each of these sub-headers are prices that reflect what SPX is unlikely to close below or above for varying probabilities defined the column header.  For instance, in the row corresponding to the 2/23/2023 date, we see a lower limit of 2950 and upper limit of 4855 under the No loss since inception column header.  This implies that SPX closing below 2950 or above 4855 on Thursday, February 23, 2023 would be historical (something that's never happened before) on a percentage price change versus time basis.  Likewise, for the 03/17/2023 date, we see a lower limit of 2865 and upper limit of 4890 under the Once Every 20 Years header.  This implies that closing below 2865 or above 4890 on Friday, March 17th, 2023 would be expected to happen once every 20 years.  Given that there are approximately 252 trading days every year, no lose since inception (60 years since 1962) corresponds to a likelihood of 1 in 15,120 or 0.0066%.  Finally, in the 1% Raw Data column, the prices reflect a 1% probability of closing below the indicated future lower limit prices or above the indicated future upper limit prices on the corresponding date based upon the entire history of SPX - including what it's done recently.  So who could benefit from this data??  ‚Ä¢   Options Traders.  The primary beneficiaries of this type of information are options  traders.  By providing closing price levels for a symbol for a given future date, an option trader can write option positions with a known probability of success for both Put and Call options.  ‚Ä¢   Long/short strategies.  Knowing when a stock/ETF/index has moved too far, too fast is an important input in a buying/selling/shorting decision.  This screening decision is done automatically by the machine learning  computers on a daily basis.  The only thing the computer doesn't do is push the buy or sell button for you.  ‚Ä¢   Elliott Wave Practitioners.  Elliott Wave analysis can be a powerful tool for analyzing the likely path a stock/ETF/index may take higher or lower.  However, there are times when multiple paths may present themselves with near equal probability using Elliott Wave analysis alone.  However, many times, one or more possible paths would require the stock/ETF/index to move in a manner that would be unlikely to happen based upon the machine learning analysis.  ‚Ä¢   Fundamentalists.  All traders have two decisions to make:  When to buy and when to sell or vice versa.  A fundamental trader chooses to screen companies based upon fundamental analysis and makes buying decisions based upon this decision.  However, when does the fundamental trader choose to sell, buy more, etc.  The stock screening method explained in this paper can be a useful tool in helping make those decisions with exact price levels.,;,; 2023-02-20 11:27:12]

Figure 1, below, shows a subset of symbols screened for February 17, 2023  &amp;#x200B;  [igure 1.  February 17, 2023 Stock Screener Subset](https://preview.redd.it/e81ihgghs4ja1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2f5e2d814d9f85b26fbaff4fd2a388ec7cb7dfe)  In the first column of Figure 1, we have sets of 3 rows that have Level 1, Level 2, and Data Since labels. The Data Since rows describe the start date for each symbol associated with the date. For instance, SPX has 1/2/1962 which means that the machine learning system contains SPX data since January 2, 1962 for the computations of SPX (S&amp;P 500). Likewise, the symbol INDY has data since November 23, 2009 for its computations, etc. Next are the rows for Level 1 and Level 2. Let's look at Level 1 first. In the rows for Level 1, a number greater than or equal to 1 indicates that on a price change % versus time basis, the symbol is overbought because it moved farther to the upside and faster than 99% of all other equivalent time periods in its history. These cells are highlighted light blue in the screener data. In the rows for Level 1, a number less or equal to zero indicates that on a price change % versus time basis, the symbol is oversold because it moved farther to the downside and faster than 99% of all other equivalent time periods in its history. These cells are highlighted light red in the screener data file. Level 2 is similar to Level 1 except that instead of 99% of the history, it is 100% of the history implying the stock/etf/index has never moved that far that fast for any equivalent period of time in the data set. Yellow highlighted cells simply highlight symbols that are near overbought or oversold on a Level 1 or Level 2 basis.  In Figure 1, we can see that TSLA screened as Level 1 overbought, AGG and BAX screened as Level 1 oversold AND UNG and SHOP as Level 1 and Level 2 oversold.  However, in this article, we are focusing on SHOP (Shopify) as it is and has been screening as historically oversold (Level 2) since it‚Äôs earnings came out.  Figure 2, below, shows a chart of the SHOP price action over the last six months.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/38z7xsuqs4ja1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e7a8499c2fe64b5a976d229ca9dc11329ac54305  Basically, SHOP price has crashed since it‚Äôs earnings came out.  So how can we use this overbought/oversold information??  The machine learning system that determines the overbought/oversold condition also provides threshold levels that correspond to what the symbol is unlikely to do in the FUTURE based upon where it is trading now.  Table 1, below, shows various levels and limits with different probabilities of occurrence for SHOP for a subset of future dates.  [Table 1.  SHOP Upper and Lower Closing Limits through March 3rd, 2023](https://preview.redd.it/xbc2hesus4ja1.png?width=1012&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f668cfefd9c385922670c2acecfbf8ab418cfeae)  In Table 1, above, we show five (5) columns corresponding to "No loss since inception", "Once Every 3 Years",  "Once Every 2 Years", and "1% Raw Data".  Under each column header are sub-headers titled "Lower Limit" and "Upper Limit".  Under each of these sub-headers are prices that reflect what SHOP is unlikely to close below or above for varying probabilities defined the column header.  For instance, in the row corresponding to the 2/23/2023 date, we see a lower limit of 31.55 and upper limit of 69.70 under the No loss since inception column header.  This implies that SHOP closing below $31.55 or above $69.70 on Thursday, February 23, 2023 would be historical (something that's never happened before) on a percentage price change versus time basis.  Likewise, for the 03/03/2023 date, we see a lower limit of $29.15 and upper limit of $77.76 under the Once Every 2 Years header.  This implies that closing below $29.15 or above $77.76 on Friday, March 3rd, 2023 would be expected to happen once every 2 years.  Given that there are approximately 252 trading days every year, once every two years corresponds to a likelihood of 1 in 504.  Finally, in the 1% Raw Data column, the prices reflect a 1% probability of closing below the indicated future lower limit prices or above the indicated future upper limit prices on the corresponding date based upon the entire history of SHOP - including what it's done recently.  So who could benefit from this data??  ‚Ä¢   Options Traders.  The primary beneficiaries of this type of information are options  traders.  By providing closing price levels for a symbol for a given future date, an option trader can write option positions with a known probability of success for both Put and Call options.  ‚Ä¢   Long/short strategies.  Knowing when a stock/ETF/index has moved too far, too fast is an important input in a buying/selling/shorting decision.  This screening decision is done automatically by the machine learning  computers on a daily basis.  The only thing the computer doesn't do is push the buy or sell button for you.  ‚Ä¢   Elliott Wave Practitioners.  Elliott Wave analysis can be a powerful tool for analyzing the likely path a stock/ETF/index may take higher or lower.  However, there are times when multiple paths may present themselves with near equal probability using Elliott Wave analysis alone.  However, many times, one or more possible paths would require the stock/ETF/index to move in a manner that would be unlikely to happen based upon the machine learning analysis.  ‚Ä¢   Fundamentalists.  All traders have two decisions to make:  When to buy and when to sell or vice versa.  A fundamental trader chooses to screen companies based upon fundamental analysis and makes buying decisions based upon this decision.  However, when does the fundamental trader choose to sell, buy more, etc.  The stock screening method explained in this paper can be a useful tool in helping make those decisions with exact price levels.,;,; 2023-02-19 11:36:04]

[(3/9) Thursday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,;,; #Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, March the 9th, 2023-  *****  # [Stock futures fall as traders assess chances of of higher rate hikes: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)  ***** &gt; U.S. stock futures dipped Thursday as traders continue to process comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and await key employment data. ***** &gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 45 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures slipped 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively. ***** &gt; Those moves come a day after Powell reiterated his warning message to lawmakers that the central bank may raise interest rates higher than previously anticipated. However, he emphasized that no decision has been made yet regarding the March meeting. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe market is finally coming to the realization that elevated interest rates are here to stay and the idea of a Fed pivot anytime soon is wishful thinking,‚Äù Main Street Research‚Äôs chief investment officer James Demmert said Thursday. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe global economy is more resilient than many realized, which will make inflation stickier and is extending central bankers‚Äô terminal rate target. Inflation has come down but is nowhere near the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, so there is much work to be done given the stubborn strength of the economy and wage inflation,‚Äù he added. ***** &gt; Investors will get more indication on the state of the economy Friday, when the U.S. government releases its monthly jobs report. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect the U.S. economy to have added 225,000 jobs in February. ***** &gt; On Wednesday, ADP reported that private payrolls increased by 242,000, more than expected. This reaffirmed the strength of the economy, which raised concern that rates could stay higher for longer. ***** &gt; Investors on Thursday will be looking at the jobless claims report, which is due at 8:30 a.m. ET. Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr is also scheduled to speak on cryptocurrencies.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/5lGzGeM.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZxPdALe.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/LiyZunc.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/7qdD5RD.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/tdl0lVA.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$CRWD $SE $DKS $CIEN $JD $AZUL $ULTA $DOCU $MDB $BDSX $BJ $HPK $SOUN $NTNX $ADAP $DRIO $RIDE $TCOM $SQSP $CPB $FSTR $BNGO $AUTL $DOMO $SNCE $NINE $RNGR $DOLE $GPS $THO $PSFE $AVAV $CARA $GWRE $VFF $BBAR $ESTE $GOL $ASAN $ORCL $XXII $CASY $FERG $DAVE $WW $GEVO $PASG $FRWG*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Z3ONWGB.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$JD $BJ $TTC $BBW $DRIO $XXII $PSFE $ARHS $VFF $VITL $KNOX $FCEL $ANIP $CMAX $BTAI $DLTH $HUT $REFI $GCO $EVGN $BWEN $UP $GWRS $HBIO $AKBA $WLY $HLLY $MEI $AOMR $KLXE $KPLT $BBLN $DCBO $DTC $DTIL $AMTX $ATY $ALDX $DSGR $EWCZ $HMPT $FULC $CEPU $LCUT $PWFL $TSQ $GBLI $GBTG*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Z3bTeKX.jpg)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/COenDb0.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/4ooNn6X.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES!](https://i.imgur.com/XA8jy8V.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/554Mx68.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/g4XgVJJ.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/EGHtwOY.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/DaiieuG.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/h6aQuUP.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/gKCWlIM.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:  * JD * SIVB * MDB * PSFE * SAVA * ASAN * TSLA * AVXL * BBLN * SHEL  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com]()**)  *****  &gt; **Etsy** ‚Äî Shares fell more than 6% in premarket after Jefferies double-downgraded the online marketplace to underperform from buy.

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 18th, 2023,;,; Good Friday afternoon to all of you here on r/StockMarket! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 18th, 2023.  # **Dow, Nasdaq close higher Friday, extending rally to a seventh winning week: Live updates- [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)** ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher Friday after a whipsaw session, where it marked a fresh intraday record, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 closed at a record high, as Wall Street pushed both major indexes to their seventh-straight winning week. ***** &gt; The Dow closed up 56 points, or 0.2%, at 37,305.16. The S&amp;P 500 slipped 36 points, or 0.01%, to 4,719.19 while the Nasdaq Composite closed up 52 points, or 0.4% at 14,813.92. The Nasdaq-100 broke above 16,573.34, a record closing high reached in November 2021. ***** &gt; Shares of Costco ended the day up 4.5% after hitting an all-time high during the session. The retailer surpassed Wall Street‚Äôs estimates for quarterly results and issued a dividend of $15 per share. ***** &gt; Both the 30-stock Dow and the tech-heavy Nasdaq notched their seventh straight positive week. As of Friday, the Dow is higher on the month by 3.7%. The S&amp;P 500 is up by 3.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite has climbed 4.2% so far in December. The S&amp;P 500‚Ä≤s close brought the index just shy of its seventh straight weekly gain, which would have marked its longest winning streak since 2017. The S&amp;P 500 could still soon join the Dow with its own all-time high, however, as the broad market index is less than 2% away from a record close set in January 2022. ***** &gt; Wall Street rallied this week after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday admitted that its efforts to tamp down inflation are taking hold, and indicated three interest rate cuts are coming in 2024, buoying investor sentiment. The November retail sales data that came in stronger than expected on Thursday, following this week‚Äôs cooler inflation readings, added to hopes the Federal Reserve could navigate a soft landing. ***** &gt; That said, New York Fed President John Williams pushed back on the euphoria around the central bank easing rates next year. ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt really talking about rate cuts right now,‚Äù Williams told CNBC‚Äôs Steve Liesman in an interview on Friday. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúStocks got a major sentiment boost from Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting, but that immediate effect was bound to wear off,‚Äù said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E-Trade. ‚ÄúThe market doesn‚Äôt go up every day, no matter how strong a trend is. Pullbacks and pauses are inevitable, regardless of how big they are or how long they last.‚Äù  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/1CKxw09.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ctidu4p.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lB7yYHS.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/bpETcIX.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jU3k5JJ.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/HVT2srn.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/9iQ7H4n.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/uGD4hxG.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bmO9QCX.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/PjXHYwd.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/58K9Yx1.png))**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/E0mZekj.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/70UpDSy.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FekAXMN.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ufkLgfJ.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/elt4ibY.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/8i1w5dx.png))**  *****  &gt; # Magnificent Seven Market Cap Round Trip  &gt; At the start of 2022, the seven largest S&amp;P 500 stocks by market cap (which have begun to colloquially be called the Magnificent Seven) possessed a combined market cap of $11.78 trillion. However, severe losses throughout 2022 meant that by the end of the year these stocks were down 47.7% on average. In terms of the combined market cap, that dropped the total down to just $6.9 trillion. In 2023, those same seven stocks have averaged a gain of 106.6%. While not all of these stocks have fully recovered‚Äîfor example, Telsa (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Meta (META) all have lower market caps than at the start of 2022‚Äîthe strong performance this year on the whole has meant the combined market cap has made a round trip. Now back to square one, what‚Äôs next?  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121523-Mag-Seve.png))**  *****  &gt; # All About Dow New Highs  &gt; In the face of many worries, stocks have put together a historic year in ‚Äô23. To top things off, the Dow just hit a fresh new all-time high, its first new high since January 4, 2022.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/blog-1-2.png))**  &gt; **New Highs Happen More Than You Think** Interestingly, this marked the 11th consecutive year that the Dow made a new high, the second longest streak ever! Of course, the previous two calendar years have had a total of only four new highs, but it still counts.  &gt; Since 1900 there have been nearly 1,400 new highs, which actually comes out to 4.5% of all days since 1900 closing at a new all-time high. That is probably much more than most people expect.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/blog-2-2.png))**  &gt; **Stocks Lead the Economy** &gt; Since markets are forward looking, stocks tend to lead the economy. This can work on the way up and way down, so for us new highs right now is suggesting the economy is on firm footing heading into ‚Äô24 and a stronger economy (with no recession) could be the play next year.  &gt; Sure, there are always some examples of that ‚Äòfinal new high‚Äô right before trouble (1929, 2000, and 2007), but looking back at history, new highs rarely suggest impending doom right around the corner.  &gt; Since World War II, there were 227 months that saw at least one new high for the Dow. A recession started within a year of one of those months only 26 times, or 11.5% of the time. Compare this with the economy being in a recession 13.9% of the time since WWII and new highs could be a subtle positive sign for the economy next year.  &gt; The last new high for the Dow was nearly two years ago, so what happens after the Dow goes a long time without new high? I found 12 times since WWII it went at least a full year without a new high and then made one, and only twice did the economy fall into a recession within a year of that new high.  &gt; What stood out about those two times was both saw Middle East turmoil and a spike in crude oil, likely contributing to the recession. Given the US now produces more oil than anyone, does it makes sense to bet against history and treat this new high as an exception? Here‚Äôs a tweet I sent on this idea.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/blog-3-2.png))**  &gt; **Now What?** &gt; Plain and simple, new highs aren‚Äôt bearish events. In fact, you tend to see new highs take place during bull markets, with more advances potentially ahead. We‚Äôve been calling this a new bull market for over a year now. As far back as last November we said the lows were in and there would be no recession in 2023 (with many arguing with us the whole way up).  &gt; In fact, here‚Äôs an interview I did six months ago with Scott Wapner on CNBC‚Äôs Closing Bell. When he asked me what my biggest worry was, I said it was that too many people were bearish and weren‚Äôt embracing this bull market.  &gt; So what do new highs mean by the numbers? By itself, a new high doesn‚Äôt appear to signal any warnings. In fact, things look about average after new highs. There are the nearly 1,400 new highs since 1900 and a year later the Dow was up 7.8% on average and higher 70.2% of the time. Compare this with the average year since 1900, which was up 7.4% on average and higher 65% of the time.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/blog-4-3.png))**  &gt; But the Dow‚Äôs long break without a new high until now improves the outlook historically. Looking at those 12 times (since WWII) the Dow went at least one year without a new high and then finally made one, ol‚Äô Papa Dow was higher a year later 10 times and up an average of 14.1% with a very solid median return of 16.4%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/blog-5.jpg))**  *****  &gt; # Wealth Effect Picks Up Into Christmas  &gt; With just two weekends left to shop before Christmas, US consumers have to be feeling a little more flush than they were just a couple months ago. Back in October, the stock market was in a 10%+ drawdown and interest rates looked like they might never stop going up. Less than two months later, though, the S&amp;P 500 Total Return index is suddenly trading at all-time highs as Treasury yields have plummeted.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/totalreturn1215.png))**  &gt; Maybe just as important for that "wealth effect" feeling is the huge drop in gas prices that we've seen since late September. Back on September 17th, AAA's national average gas price reading (the cost of a gallon of regular unleaded) hit a 52-week high of $3.88. In the three months since then, there has hardly been a day when gas prices haven't gone down, and just yesterday the price/gallon ticked down to $3.087. That drop took gas prices below the low of $3.096 seen last December 22nd to their lowest levels in more than two and a half years dating back to 6/24/21.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/gallongas.png))**  &gt; With the stock market at new highs again and gas prices suddenly approaching a "2-handle," Santa may have a little more room in his gift sack this year!  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/santgabag.png))**  *****  &gt; # FAANG+ Leaving Newcomers in the Dust  &gt; Both the NYSE FAANG+ Index and Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) have put in place fresh 52-week highs in the past couple of days, however, zooming out, those fresh highs are on different planets. The NYSE FAANG+ index‚Äîcomprised of many mega cap Tech stocks‚Äîis not only at a 52-week high, but it's trading at record highs. Since the pre-COVID market high in February 2020, the FANG+ group is now up 120.1%. As for the IPO ETF, this week's 52-week high only leaves the group at the highest levels since April 2022. Contrary to the all-time high for FAANG+, IPO is still down 51.7% from its February 2021 high and is up a meager 4.7% since pre-COVID. As you can see below, these two traded closely inline with each other in the early days of the post-COVID rally, but FANG+ has left IPO in the dust since the start of 2022.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121523-FANG-vs-IPO.png))**  *****  &gt; # Bulls Take the Majority  &gt; More and more equity indices are hitting fresh record highs with the S&amp;P 500 within 1.5% of doing the same. Understandably on these moves, investor sentiment has gotten a further boost. Per the latest AAII Investor Sentiment Survey, 51.3% of investors reported as bullish this week. And keep in mind, due to the timing of the survey, that would not have fully captured any investor response to yesterday's FOMC. That is the highest and first reading above 50% since July 20th of this year when bulls were only 0.1 percentage points higher. Outside of that week, it would be the highest bullish sentiment reading since April 2022.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-AAII-1.png))**  &gt; Given the new high in bulls, bears have been nowhere to be found. A meager 19.3% of respondents reported as bearish this week. That surpasses the recent low of 19.6% from just two weeks ago for the lowest amount since the first week of January 2018 when only 15.56% of responses were bearish.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-AAII-2.png))**  &gt; The overwhelmingly bullish sentiment can also be observed through the bull-bear spread. Currently, the share of bulls outnumber bears by 32 percentage points. That is the widest margin in favor of bulls since April 2021. Looked at another way, that is 2.1 standard deviations above the historical average of the spread meaning sentiment is extremely extended..  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-AAII-3.png))**  &gt; The cheery sentiment on the part of investors certainly means there is a warm and fuzzy feeling during this holiday season, but we would note that sentiment is historically a contrarian indicator. In other words, opposite to what investors are feeling, extremely bullish sentiment readings have historically been followed by more lackluster returns.  *****  &gt; # Claims Cooling Down  &gt; Economic data this morning broadly came in healthier than expected, including weekly jobless claims. Initial claims were expected to go unchanged at 220K. While that previous week's reading was revised up to 221K, this week's print fell all the way down to 202K. That is the lowest reading on jobless claims since the week of October 14th and September 16th before that. In all, that makes for one of the lowest readings on claims since January of last year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-Claims-1.png))**  &gt; Before seasonal adjustment, claims are largely following the usual seasonal pattern having been trending higher since the early fall. Currently at 248.3K, unadjusted claims are running at the lowest level for the comparable week of the year since 1969.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-Claims-2.png))**  &gt; Continuing claims have gotten much more elevated than initial claims over the past few months. Currently totaling 1.876 million, continuing claims have risen meaningfully from the low of 1.658 million put in place just three months ago. However, the consistent pace of increases over that span (every week from September 16th through the first week of November saw a week over week increase) has slowed, having been more choppy in the past month. In fact, at 1.876 million, the current reading is still almost 50K below the recent high of 1.925 million set in mid-November.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121423-Claims-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # Moderating Inflation &amp; Final Fed Meeting Clear Path for late-December Surge  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/ef864c3f84106395bbfd2b61bd54035c/858694959f22126f-96/s500x750/a55689a0153a6b79ad518fa46fcda7cf02675b2f.jpg))**  &gt; This week‚Äôs CPI and PPI releases showed the moderating trend of inflation continues. Prices are still rising just at a slower pace and the rate of change could finally fall back before the Fed‚Äôs target of 2% next year. In response to and in anticipation of lower interest rates, the market has enjoyed above average gains in December.  &gt; As of the close on December 12, DJIA was up 1.74%, S&amp;P 500 +1.66%, NASDAQ +2.16% and Russell 2000 up an impressive 3.99% (right side vertical axis of chart above). The market did experience some typical early December weakness this year after bucking the trend of weakness on the first trading day. Even though the market has already enjoyed above average gains this month, we still anticipate more to come with the potential for a new all-time closing high from DJIA before year end.  *****  &gt; # Inflation Still Moving in the Right Direction  &gt; This morning‚Äôs Consumer Price Index for November was mostly in line with expectations (although the headline reading was slightly higher than expected), and the lack of any meaningful surprises has allowed the market to continue with what has lately been the path of least resistance, which has been higher. The report also showed that the most rapid leg of disinflation is most likely behind us, and while that could lead some to believe that the road ahead will be a slog, that isn‚Äôt necessarily the case.  &gt; For starters, the focus of monthly inflation reports lately has been in Core CPI (ex-food and energy). After peaking at 6.6% in June 2022, the November year/year reading came in at 4.0% for the second month in a row.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-Core-CPI.png))**  &gt; The chart below shows the historical 12-month rate of change in the y/y core CPI. Over the last 12 months, that rate of increase has declined by two full percentage points, and outside of the prior two months, that is one of the sharpest declines since the early 1980s. In other words, the 12-month rate of change is still declining, but the pace of decline is slowing.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-Core-CPI-One-Year-Change.png))**  &gt; November‚Äôs streak also ended what has been a monumental streak of monthly declines in the y/y core CPI reading. At seven months in October, it was the second longest streak on record, trailing only the ten-month streak of declines ending in December 1975.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-Core-CPI-Declines-Streaks.png))**  &gt; Understandably, the end of the streak of declines along with the slowing rate of decline in the y/y core CPI reading could lead one to think that inflation levels are plateauing at a higher level. However, a look at the trend of monthly prints in core CPI shows a potential tailwind in the months ahead. The chart below shows the monthly change in core CPI over the last 24 months. While it hasn‚Äôt exactly been linear, the trend is lower. In the twelve months from December 2021 through November 2022, eight out of twelve monthly prints were 0.5% or above, but in the last twelve months, only one print has been 0.5%.  &gt; Just looking at the last year (shaded area in chart) it‚Äôs a similar trend. From December 2022 through May 2022, every monthly print was 0.4% or above, but in the most recent six months, every print has been 0.3% or below. If just the trend of the last six months remains in place, for the next six months the y/y reading will be replacing monthly prints of 0.4% or more with prints of 0.3% or less which should help to keep the trend of disinflation going.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-Core-CPI-Monthly-Change.png))**  *****  &gt; # Small Business Sentiment Mixed Under the Hood  &gt; The NFIB unveiled its latest look at small business sentiment early this morning. The headline number remains in the bottom decile of its historical range, falling 0.1 points to 90.6 in November. That is compared to expectations which called for the number to be unchanged last month.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-1.png))**  &gt; Across the categories factoring into the index, breadth was mixed in November with four categories falling, four rising, and one unchanged. Like the headline number, many categories are also in the bottom few percentiles of their respective historical ranges, albeit with some exceptions like robust readings in plans to increase employment, current inventories, and job openings hard to fill.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-2.png))**  &gt; As we discussed in our Morning Lineup, combining the report's readings on employment shows some rebounding conditions for labor markets over the past few months. Looking more closely, though, it is hard to say labor market conditions are materially accelerating. As shown, hiring plans have risen, but on net more companies are reporting negative employment changes. In a similar vein, compensation plans have risen sharply including a six point jump month over month in November (the largest one month increase since last October and the third largest on record), even though actual changes to compensation have been flat. Meanwhile, fewer businesses are reporting job openings are hard to fill. Small businesses are showing labor conditions have cooled over the past couple of years but are far from weak as any more recent improvements have been from plans rather than observed changes.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-4.png))**  &gt; Similarly, sales expectations rebounded in November, contrary to a flat reading on actual sales and earnings changes. Perhaps most importantly, the share of businesses reporting higher prices has fallen down to 25, matching the July low. In combination with the higher reading on sales expectations, that likely helped the number of firms reporting now as a good time to expand.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-5.png))**  &gt; Looking at the reverse, of those reporting now as not a good time to expand, the single biggest reason given for such sentiment was economic conditions. That is typically the most widely cited reason historically followed by political climate (the NFIB has a tendency to be sensitive to politics, namely which party holds the presidency), but for the first time in at least a decade, financial conditions and interest rates earned the number two spot. As shown below, the number of firms reporting that rates are holding them back from expanding has risen steadily since the current tightening cycle began.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-6b.png))**  &gt; As mentioned previously, actual earnings changes saw no improvement in November and are sitting near historically weak levels. As for the reasons given for lower earnings, increased costs remain a key reason, but November also saw a significant jump in those reporting sales volumes as a problem. In other words, inflation and weaker demand appear to be weighing on small business earnings.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-5a.png))**  &gt; Despite the burden of interest rates and expectations for credit conditions sitting at the lowest levels in over a decade, small businesses have actually increased capital expenditures dramatically to a new post-pandemic high. However, that is counter to capital expenditure plans, which have fallen in the past few months, and inventories showing drawdowns.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/12/121223-NFIB-6.png))**  *****  Here is the full list of companies report earnings for this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 12.18.23 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) (NONE.)  &gt; # ***Monday 12.18.23 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/G9kJkCv.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 12.19.23 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wuAEw5Q.png))  &gt; # ***Tuesday 12.19.23 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/fSjaZjQ.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 12.20.23 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JNndzTW.png))  &gt; # ***Wednesday 12.20.23 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/SJnw3ft.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 12.21.23 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/N7CUSm7.png))  &gt; # ***Thursday 12.21.23 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XlSxDrb.png))  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 12.22.23 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]()) (NONE.)  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 12.22.23 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) (NONE.)  *****  # DISCUSS!

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023,;,; Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023.  # **Stocks close higher Friday as investors try to shake off latest bank fears: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/stock-futures-are-up-slightly-as-investors-weigh-bank-troubles-fed-decision.html)** ***** &gt; Stocks rose Friday, reversing their earlier session declines as Deutsche Bank shares pared back some losses. ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 132.28 points, or 0.41%, closing at 32,238.15. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.57%, while Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.3%. The major indexes all had a winning week, with the Dow gaining 0.4% week-to-date as of Friday afternoon, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq gained 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively. ***** &gt; Deutsche Bank‚Äôs U.S.-listed shares slid 3.11% Friday, rebounding from a 7% drop earlier in the trading session. A selloff of shares was triggered after the the German lender‚Äôs credit default swaps jumped, but without an apparent catalyst. The move appeared to raise concerns once again over the health of the European banking industry. Earlier this month, Swiss regulators forced a UBS acquisition of rival Credit Suisse. Deutsche Bank shares traded off their worst levels of the session, which caused major U.S. indexes to also cut their losses. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think that the market overall is neither frightened nor optimistic ‚Äî it‚Äôs simply confused,‚Äù said George Ball, president at Sanders Morris Harris. ‚ÄúThe price action for the last month-and-a-half, including today, is a jumble without any direction or conviction.‚Äù ***** &gt; Ball added that Deutsche Bank is ‚Äúvery sound financially.‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIt could be crippled if there‚Äôs a big loss of confidence and there‚Äôs a run on the bank. There is, however, no fundamental reason why that should occur, other than nervousness.‚Äù ***** &gt; European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde tried to ease concerns, saying euro zone banks are resilient with strong capital and liquidity positions. Lagarde said the ECB could provide liquidity if needed. ***** &gt; Investors continued to assess the Fed‚Äôs latest policy move announced this week. The central bank hiked rates by a quarter-point. However, it also hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be ending soon. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that credit conditions have tightened, which could put pressure on the economy. ***** &gt; On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said regulators are prepared to take more action if needed to stabilize U.S. banks. Her comments are the latest among regulators attempting to buoy confidence in the U.S. banking system in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank closures. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúRetail [and] institutional investors are both looking at the banking system, but now internationally. That‚Äôs dangerous,‚Äù Ball added. ‚ÄúBanks exist because of confidence in their stability, and that confidence can be eroded as we now see, via social media and technology in a matter of minutes.‚Äù  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kYFZ0mb.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/sa1yxWq.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/QsHW7no.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/OGQZBeP.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/uIef67v.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kr3YfHV.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JiYUEBP.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CKcDnul.png))**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vsFHgKf.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mconM20.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H7KFVcz.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ymKQozZ.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TsJcX1J.png))**   *****  &gt; # Best and Worst Stocks Since the COVID Crash Low  &gt; We are now three years out from the COVID Crash low, and even with the past year's weakness, most assets continue to sit on solid gains. For major US index ETFs, the S&amp;P Midcap 400 (IJH) is up the most having slightly more than doubled while the S&amp;P Smallcap 600 (IJR) is not far behind having rallied 95.9%. Value has generally outperformed growth, especially for mid and small-caps although that has shifted somewhat this year. For example, while its gains have been more middling since the COVID crash, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has been the strongest area of the equity market in 2023 thanks to the strength of sectors like Tech (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC). Although those sectors have posted strong gains this year, they have been the weakest over the past three years while Energy (XLE) far and away has been the strongest asset class. Paired with the strength of energy stocks has been solid runs in commodities (DBC)more broadly with the notable exception being Natural Gas (UNG) which has lost over 40%. Bond ETFs are similarly sitting on losses since the COVID Crash lows. As for international markets, Mexico (EWW) and India (PIN) have outpaced the rest of the world although Emerging Markets (EEM) as a whole have not been particularly strong; likely being dragged on by the weaker performance of China (ASHR) which holds a large weight on EEM.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low.png))**  &gt; Taking a look at current S&amp;P 500 members, nearly half of the index has more than doubled over the past three years. As for the absolute best performers, Energy stocks dominate the list with four of the top five best-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks coming from that sector. Targa Resources (TRGP) has been the absolute best performer with a nearly 900% total return. Other notables include a couple of heavy weight stocks: Tesla (TSLA) and NVIDIA (NVDA) with gains of 563.9% and 412.9%, respectively.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low-2.png))**  &gt; On the other end of the spectrum, there are currently 25 stocks that have posted a negative return since the COVID Crash low. The worst has been First Republic Bank (FRC) which has been more of a recent development. Whereas today the stock has posted an 83.1% loss, at the start of this month it would have been a 65% gain. Another standout on the list of worst performers has been Amazon (AMZN). Most other mega caps have more than doubled since the March 2020 S&amp;P 500 low, however, the e-commerce giant has hardly offered a positive return.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # Sector Performance Experiences a Historical Divergence  &gt; The first quarter of 2023 is coming to a close next week, and checking in on year to date performance, there has been a big divergence between the winners and losers. Although the S&amp;P 500 is up 2.84% on the year as of yesterday's close, only three of the eleven sectors are higher. Not only are those three sectors up on the year, but they have posted impressive double digit gains only three months into the year. Of those three, Consumer Discretionary has posted the smallest gain of 10% whereas Technology and Communication Services have risen 17.2% and 18.1%, respectively. The fact that these sectors are home to the main mega cap stocks -- like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have been on an impressive run of late -- helps to explain how the market cap weighted S&amp;P 500 is up on the year without much in the way of healthy breadth on a sector level.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-1a.png))**  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-1.png))**  &gt; One thing that is particularly remarkable about this year's sector performance is just how rare it is for a sector to be up 10%+ (let alone 3) while all other sectors are lower. And that is for any point of the year let alone in the first quarter. As we mentioned in yesterday's Sector Snapshot and show in the charts below, going back to 1990, there have only been two other periods in which a sector has risen at least 10% YTD while all other sectors were lower YTD. The first of those was in May 2009. In a similar instance to now, Consumer Discretionary, Tech, and Materials were the three sectors with double digit gains back then. With those sectors up solidly, the S&amp;P 500 was little changed on the year with a less than 1% gain. As you can see below, though, by the end of 2009, every sector had pushed into positive territory as the new bull market coming out of the global financial crisis was well underway.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-2.png))**  &gt; The next occurrence was much more recent: 2022. Obviously, it was a tough year for equities except for the Energy sector which had a banner year. Throughout most of the year, the sector traded up by well over 20% year to date even while the rest of the equity market was battered.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # The Fed Expects Banking Stress to Substitute for Rate Hikes  &gt; The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 0.25% at their March meeting, bringing it to the 4.75-5.0% range. This is the ninth-straight rate increase and brings rates to their highest level since 2007. However, the most aggressive tightening cycle since the early 1980s, which saw them lift rates all the way from near zero to almost 5%, is near its end.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-target-rate-601x800.png))**  &gt; Up until early February, Fed officials expected to raise rates to a maximum of about 5.1% and hold it there for a while. However, since that time, we‚Äôve gotten a slew of strong economic data, including elevated inflation numbers. This pushed fed officials to give ‚Äúguidance‚Äù that they expected to raise rates by more than they estimated back in December.  &gt; Market expectations for policy also moved in conjunction. Prior to February, markets expected the Fed to raise rates to 5% by June, and subsequently lower them by about 0.5% by the end of the year. But strong incoming data and Fed guidance pushed expectations higher, with the terminal rate moving up to 5.6% and no cuts in 2023.  &gt; # The Silicon Valley Bank crisis changed everything &gt; The bank crisis that erupted over the last couple of weeks resulted in a significant shift, both in expectations for policy and now the Fed as well. See here for our complete rundown on SVB and the ensuing crisis.  &gt; Market expectations for Fed policy rates immediately moved lower. Markets expected the stress in banks to translate to tighter credit conditions, which in turn would lead to slower economic growth and lower inflation.  &gt; This was nicely articulated by Professor Jeremey Siegel, one of the foremost commentators on financial markets and fed policy, in our latest episode of the Facts vs Feelings podcast, Prof. Siegel said that tighter credit conditions, as lending standards become more strict, are de facto rate hikes.  &gt; Fed Chair Powell more or less said exactly the same thing after the Fed‚Äôs March meeting. The 0.25% increase was an attempt to thread the needle between financial stability and fighting inflation. Fed officials also forecast the fed funds rate to hit a maximum of 5.1%, unchanged from their December estimate. This is a marked shift from what was expected just a few weeks ago, with Powell explicitly saying that tighter credit conditions ‚Äúsubstitute‚Äù for rate hikes.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-rate-expectations-600x800.png))**  &gt; # There‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty ahead &gt; While the recent bank stresses are expected to tighten credit conditions and thereby impact economic growth and inflation, there are a couple of open questions:  &gt; * How big will the impact be?  &gt; * How long will the impact last?  &gt; These are unknown currently. Which means future policy is also unknown.  &gt; Fed officials expect to take rates to 5.1%, i.e., one more rate increase. And then expect to hold it there through the end of the year. In short, they don‚Äôt expect rate cuts this year.  &gt; Yet investors expect no more rate increases and about 0.6% of rate cuts in the second half of 2023. Markets expect the policy rate in June to be at 4.8%, while expectations for December are at 4.2%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-implied-policy-rate-differential-600x800.png))**  &gt; There‚Äôs clearly a huge gulf between what the Fed expects versus what investors expect. This will have to reconcile in one of two ways:  &gt; * Market expectations move higher ‚Äì if economic/inflation data remain strong and credit conditions don‚Äôt look to be tightening significantly.  &gt; * Fed expectations move lower ‚Äì if the banking sector comes under renewed stress, credit conditions could tighten significantly and eventually lead to weaker data.  &gt; Things are obviously not going to go in either direction in a straight line. It‚Äôs going to be a bumpy ride as new data points come in, not to mention news/rumors of renewed problems in the banking sector.  *****  &gt; # Seasonality Keeps Claims Below 200K?  &gt; Initial jobless claims remained healthy this week with another sub-200K print. Claims fell modestly to 191K from last week's unrevised reading of 192K. That small decline exceeded expectations of claims rising up to 197K. Given claims continue to impress, the seasonally adjusted number has come in below 200K for 9 of the last 10 weeks. By that measure, it has been the strongest stretch for claims since last April when there were 10 weeks in a row of sub-200K prints. Prior to that, from 2018 through 2020 the late March and early April period similarly saw consistent readings under 200K meaning that some of the strength in the adjusted number could be on account of residual seasonality.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-1.png))**  &gt; In fact, this point of the year has some of the weeks in which claims have the most consistently historically fallen week over week. Taking a historical median of claims throughout the year, claims tend to round out a short-term bottom in the spring before an early summer bump. In other words, seasonal strength will begin to wane in the coming months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-2.png))**  &gt; While initial claims improved, continuing claims worsened rising to 1.694 million from 1.68 million the previous week. Albeit higher, that remains below the 2023 high of 1.715 million set at the end of February.  *****  &gt; # A Fed Day Like Most Others  &gt; Yesterday's Fed decision and comments from Fed Chair Powell gave markets plenty to chew on. As we discussed in last night's Closer and today's Morning Lineup, there have been a number of conflicting statements from officials and confusing reactions in various assets over the past 24 hours. In spite of all that uncertainty, the S&amp;P 500's path yesterday pretty much followed the usual script. In the charts below we show the S&amp;P's average intraday pattern across all Fed days since Powell has been chair (first chart) and the intraday chart of the S&amp;P yesterday (second chart). As shown, the market's pattern yesterday, especially after the 2 PM ET rate decision and the 2:30 PM press conference, closely resembled the average path that the market has followed across all Powell Fed Days since 2018.  &gt; The S&amp;P saw a modest bounce after the 2 PM Fed decision and then a further rally right after Powell's presser began at 2:30 PM. That initial post-presser spike proved to be a pump-fake, as markets ultimately sold off hard with a near 2% decline from 2:30 PM to the 4 PM close.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-1a.png))**  &gt; So what typically happens in the week after Fed days? Since 1994 when the Fed began announcing policy decisions on the same day as its meeting, the S&amp;P has averaged a decline of 10 basis points over the next week. During the current tightening cycle that began about a year ago, market performance in the week after Fed days has been even worse with the S&amp;P averaging a decline of 0.99%. However, when the S&amp;P has been down over 1% on Fed days (like yesterday), performance over the next week has been positive with an average gain of 0.64%. As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-3.png))**  *****   &gt; # What Now? An Update on Recent Bank Stress.  &gt; It‚Äôs been less than 2 weeks since Silicon Valley Bank‚Äôs stunning 48-hour collapse, and a few more banks have been caught in the fray. New York regulators closed the doors on Signature Bank on Sunday, March 12. A week later, US banks injected $30 billion into First Republic Bank to keep it afloat, and UBS acquired rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse in a government-brokered deal. In the midst of the chaos, your Carson Investment Research team was there for you with client-facing content, professional advice, and investment solutions. In fact, we think this event presents an opportunity to invest in the more stable large-cap financial companies and recently upgraded the sector to overweight in our House Views Advice.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mar22_1-1600x927.png))**  &gt; # Why is this happening? &gt; The rapid hike in interest rates caused an asset and liability mismatch for banks. Due to many years of low-interest rates, banks invested assets in interest-earning loans and bonds that would be repaid over the next five-plus years, which at the time was a logical way to earn a higher yield. Regulators considered government bonds to be among the safest ways a bank could invest its capital. As interest rates rose, bond values dropped. Interest rates rose at the fastest pace in history, and the safe assets that banks invested in lost value to the tune of more than $620 billion in unrealized losses as of the end of last year. This decline in value left weaker banks underwater and, when coupled with depositors pulling money out, caused them to collapse or seek costly capital raises.  &gt; # Why this matters to investors? &gt; The weakness in the banking sector will likely lead to tighter lending standards, potentially slowing economic growth. The reason we‚Äôre in this mess, to begin with, is that the Fed hiked interest rates to slow the economy because inflation was rising too quickly. Perhaps the 16% drop in oil prices over the past two weeks reflected this slower growth and bodes well for continued falling inflation. Thus, the Fed is closer to achieving its goal.  &gt; Maybe it‚Äôs an overreaction as ‚Äúbanking crisis‚Äù headlines stir painful memories of 2008. Either way, an environment with slower growth and lower inflation isn‚Äôt a bad time to invest. Bonds and stocks could both perform well, especially stocks of companies with the ability to grow earnings. We also reiterate our House Views Advice overweight on the large-cap Financials sector. The largest US banks are well-capitalized and are gaining market share from the smaller regional banks. We believe this calamity provides an opportunity for stronger banks and investors to capitalize on.  *****  &gt; # FANG+ Flying  &gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup, sector performance has heavily favored areas like Tech, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services in recent weeks. Playing into that sector level performance has been the strength of the mega-caps. The NYSE FANG+ index tracks ten of the largest and most highly traded Tech and Tech-adjacent names. In the past several days, that cohort of stocks is breaking out to the highest level since last April whereas the S&amp;P 500 still needs to rally 4% to reach its February high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-1.png))**  &gt; Although FANG+ stocks have been strong recently, that follows more than a full year of underperformance. As shown below, relative to the S&amp;P 500, mega-cap Tech consistently underperformed from February 2021 through this past fall. In the past few days, the massive outperformance has resulted in a breakout of the downtrend for the ratio of FANG+ to the S&amp;P 500.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-2.png))**  &gt; More impressive is how rapid of a move it has been for that ratio to break out. Below, we show the 2-month percent change in the ratio above. As of the high at yesterday's close, the ratio had risen 22.5% over the prior two months. That comes up just short of the record (22.6%) leading up to the pre-COVID high in February 2020. In other words, mega-cap Tech has experienced near-record outperformance relative to the broader market. However, we would note that this is in the wake of last year when the group had seen some of its worst two-month underperformance on record with the worst readings being in March, May, and November.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # March Seasonality Prevails, Banking Fiasco Be Damned  &gt; It‚Äôs encouraging typical March seasonal patterns have overcome recent bank failures, recession talk and fearmongering. The early March pullback was steeper than normal, but the usual mid-month rebound appears to be materializing.  &gt; Last week‚Äôs gains could be an indication we have seen the worst of the banking fallout and the end of the pullback. Triple Witching Weeks have tended to be down in flat periods and dramatically so during bear markets. Positive March Triple Witching weeks in 2003 and 2009 confirmed the market was back in rally mode.  &gt; The week after March Triple Witching is notoriously nasty. S&amp;P is down 27 of the last 40 year ‚Äì and frequently down sharply. Positive or flat action this week would be constructive.  &gt; In the old days March used to come in like a bull and out like a bear. Nowadays March has evolved into an inflection point where short-term trends often change course. The market is clearly at an important juncture and it‚Äôs a good time to remember Warren Buffet‚Äôs wise words to ‚ÄúBe greedy when others are fearful.‚Äù  &gt; Bank failures are never a good thing, but the swift actions of regulators likely prevented further damage to the industry. At the least, the banks are likely to be under even greater scrutiny going forward. In the near-term we expect more volatile trading. Further out we expect the market, and the economy will recover like they both have historically done.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5fe6f3377343f819ff93c97e8aeb8ffc/1258a39f06bd18c7-63/s500x750/303b38d927e1a424f5dc254dd086678978f2cc12.jpg))**  *****  &gt; # Nasdaq Leaves the S&amp;P in the Dust  &gt; Looking at the major US index ETF screen of our Trend Analyzer shows just how disconnected the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has become from other major index ETFs recently. As shown below, as of Friday's close, QQQ actually finished in overbought territory (over 1 standard above its 50-DMA) whereas many other major index ETFs were oversold, some of those to an extreme degree. On a year to date basis, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has rallied more than 14% compared to low single digit gains or losses for the rest of the pack.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/usindexqqq.png))**  &gt; Historically, the major indices, namely the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, tend to trade at similar overbought and oversold levels. In the chart below we show the Nasdaq 100 and S&amp;P 500's distance from their 50-DMAs (expressed in standard deviations) over the past five years. As shown, typically the two large cap indices have seen similar albeit not identical readings. That is until the past few weeks in which the two have diverged more significantly.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**  &gt; On Friday there was more than 2 standard deviations between the Nasdaq's overbought 50-DMA spread and the S&amp;P 500's oversold spread. As shown in the chart below, that surpassed recent highs in the spread like the spring of 2020 to set the highest reading since October 2016.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**  &gt; Going back to 1985, the spread between the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 50-DMA spreads diverging to such a degree is not without precedent, but it is also not exactly common. Friday marked the 16th time that spread eclipsed 2 standard deviations for the first time in at least 3 months. Relative to those prior instances, the current overbought and oversold readings in both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are relatively middling. However, only the instance in early 2000 similarly saw the Nasdaq technically overbought (trading at least a standard deviation above its 50-DMA) while the S&amp;P 500 was simultaneously oversold (at least one standard deviation below its 50-DMA).  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 24th, 2023**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JnEIcSYZEM))**  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3/26/23**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; (*$CCL $BNTX $LULU $MU $IZEA $SKLZ $WBA $HTHT $FUTU $LOVE $RH $PAYX $IHS $GOEV $CALM $PLAY $RUM $CTAS $CNM $MKC $BB $EVGO $VERO $AUGX $RGF $GMDA $SNX $RAIL $AEHR $PVH $SRT $UGRO $AADI $PRGS $DNMR $NEOG $CONN $IMBI $SOL $LOV $GROY $EE $ABOS $CNXC $UNF $AMPS $JEF $ESLT $CURI $DARE*)  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/mconM20.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/B9lJ6yg.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/kQxLMVP.png))**  *****  &gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).  &gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))  *****  # DISCUSS!

[Time to buy Tesla ($TSLA) stock before Q1 earnings?,;,;    Tesla ($TSLA) will be a highlight of this week‚Äôs earnings lineup, set to report its first-quarter results on Wednesday, April 19.  With shares of $TSLA off to a magnificent start this year, investors may be wondering if now is a good time to invest in the EV leader.  Let‚Äôs see if Tesla stock is a buy right now or if there are better opportunities ahead.  **Q1 Preview**  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tesla‚Äôs Q1 earnings is $0.85 per share, which would be a -20% decline from EPS of $1.07 in the prior-year quarter. Sales are expected to be up 25% at $23.56 billion Vs. $18.76 billion in Q1 2022.  The dip in Tesla‚Äôs YoY quarterly bottom line is partly attributed to higher commodity prices among raw materials like steel and aluminum in correlation with inflation. However, Tesla has also implemented several price cuts in the pricing of its EVs to boost deliveries and roll out newer models.  [ ](https://preview.redd.it/nc3nuu2udmua1.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d91a2d5fcfc7ad728237fb839d2e98f65d8a143)  Image Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  While Tesla hopes its price cuts will boost demand and lead to higher sales volume, Wall Street will be closely monitoring the effect this has on the company‚Äôs earnings. To that point, many analysts are concerned that lower vehicle pricing will chip away at Tesla‚Äôs profit margins with the comany cutting its prices five times since January.  Tesla has now dropped the prices of its Model S sedan by roughly 5% to $89,000 and its Model X SUV by 9% to $99,000. The luxury versions of these models have also been lowered by about $5,000.  With that being said, the Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction indicates Tesla should reach its Q1 earnings expectations with the Most Accurate Estimate also at $0.85 per share.   **Deliveries¬†&amp;¬†Demand**¬†   The ability to continue expanding deliveries is critical during Tesla‚Äôs quarterly results. In this regard, the increasing popularity and demand for EVs may justify Tesla‚Äôs willingness to slash its prices. With demand in focus, Tesla announced earlier in the month that it delivered a quarterly record of 422,875 vehicles during the first quarter, a 36% increase from 310,000 deliveries in Q1 2022. ¬†  This would still fall short of Wall Street‚Äôs estimates of 430,000 deliveries for the first quarter. As shown in the chart below, Tesla stock soared in its last quarterly report after beating delivery expectations but plummetted in the prior quarter when missing estimates. Still, Tesla‚Äôs ability to offer strong guidance for continued delivery growth next quarter could boost its stock.   **Growth &amp; Outlook**  Tesla is still the global leader in EV sales and controls about 65% of the market share in the United States. However, monitoring Tesla‚Äôs growth is very important for investors with companies like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) looking to even the playing field.  According to Zacks estimates, Tesla earnings are expected to dip -5% this year but rebound and climb 33% in fiscal 2024 at $5.11 per share. It is important to note that earnings estimate revisions have gone down over the last quarter. ¬†  On the top line, sales are forecasted to jump 25% in FY23 and soar another 21% in FY24 to $123.03 billion. More impressive, fiscal 2024 would be a very stellar 401% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $24.57 billion.  [ ](https://preview.redd.it/wjxy3fvzdmua1.png?width=620&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af3049e7976c81d7b4fddd720f49b219f194bcd6)  **Performance &amp; Valuation**  Tesla stock is up an impressive +52% year to date to largely outperform the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs +8% and the Auto Manufacturers-Domestic Markets +22%. As a loose comparison, Tesla has easily topped General Motors‚Äô +4% and Ford‚Äôs +9% YTD performance.  Even better, Tesla stock has now climbed +272% over the last three years to beat the benchmark, General Motors‚Äô +41%, Ford‚Äôs +151%, and its Zacks Subindustry‚Äôs +88%.   Shares of TSLA currently trade around $187 and 48.2X forward earnings which is well below its extreme decade-long high and 78% beneath the median of 223.9X. Tesla still trades above the industry average of 10.8X but Wall Street has historically been ok with paying a premium for the company's growth as a leader and pioneer in its space.  **Bottom Line**  Going into its Q1 report Tesla stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).¬†Tesla‚Äôs annual top and bottom line growth is still intriguing despite¬†the decline in earnings estimates with its more reasonable P/E valuation offering support.  Although the recent price cuts among its EVs may lead to better buying opportinuies in Tesla stock, this should also boost future demand. In this regard, investors could be¬† rewarded for holding on to Tesla shares at current levels especially as inflation begins to ease.¬†,;,; 2023-04-18 10:29:41]

[Tesla: How about its inventory level?,;,; A lot of posts are talking about Tesla's production and deliveries in 2023, thus would like to look into the numbers from another perspective.  # INVENTORY  https://preview.redd.it/omsupf0ar1ac1.jpg?width=424&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2309e6cfc9f615286d06e98ab7bb200c91aa9c13  When we look at the production and deliveries numbers between 2021 and 2023, it is not difficult to identify that the aggregate production is larger than the aggregate deliveries \[note: -5,750 for FY2021, +55,760 for FY2022 and +37,404 for FY2023\].  With the fierce competition observed in the market (lead to price slash and hence decline in gross profit margin) as well as the loss of tax credit / green benefits in 2024 (lead to possible lower demand for some of its core products), wonder if inventory will become a problem for the company in future.

[Tesla net income and earnings drop more than 20% from last year,;,; Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.  Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv  Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates  Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.  Automotive revenue, Tesla‚Äôs core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.  Tesla‚Äôs first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.  The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.  Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.  Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.   Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management‚Äôs consideration were seeking updates on the company‚Äôs trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company‚Äôs energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.  In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.  A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day‚Äôs drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.  According to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.  Tesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023.

AI and robotics will increasingly come into focus.  #Sales Vehicle deliveries increased from 405,278 to 484,507, a 20% rise from Q4-2022 to Q4-2023. Elon Musk hinted in the conference call that Tesla's FY24 Volume growth "may be notably lower."  #Revenue Increased from $24.32 bn. to $25.2 bn. - a moderate growth of 3.6%. Despite increased deliveries, lower prices per vehicle &amp; an unfavorable model mix (more lower-priced models) dampened the revenue increase.  #Margin Declined from 16% to 8.2% - here the price reductions &amp; higher production costs due to the Cybertruck are evident. Operating income fell from $3.89 bn. to $2.06 bn. Another positive note is the increase in EBIT margin compared to Q3-2023 at 7.6% - the bottom has been passed!  #EPS (Adjusted) This fell from $1.19 to $0.71, a 40% decrease. Despite a one-time tax benefit of $1.56 per share (or $5.9 bn.), the decline in profitability metrics could not be offset.  #FreeCashflow &amp; #Cash Jumped from $1.42 bn. to $2.06 bn. (+45%). As a result, the cash balance increased from $22.2 bn. to $29.1 bn. (+31%). This demonstrates Tesla's ability to efficiently generate and utilize capital - even in challenging times!  #Guidance Despite the solid figures, the guidance for 2024 remains cautious. Expected lower growth rates in vehicle volume could cool growth, while the focus is on the next generation of vehicles (Model 2/A in 2025 for $25,000).,;,; 2024-01-25 11:38:53]

[Will Tesla go up (a): a comprehensive understanding of Tesla,;,; At dinner, my children's relatives in the securities company said to me, Tesla has gone up a lot!  &amp;#x200B;  I said, "Tesla will go up again.  &amp;#x200B;  Then, he looked at me with a puzzled face.  &amp;#x200B;  At that time, I had been studying Tesla for a week and was about to finish.  &amp;#x200B;  So, I was still sure about this conclusion.  &amp;#x200B;  Why did I dare to say that?  &amp;#x200B;  Of course, it starts with understanding Tesla -  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/jgop2vtosloa1.png?width=1039&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17a8da5736bfe9e930a40fb054e6afeeb81979d7  &amp;#x200B;  Tesla's businesses are: electric vehicles, energy storage, solar energy, etc.  &amp;#x200B;  Among them, according to the financial data of Q4 22: total revenue of 24.3 billion, 21.3 billion ($) in automotive revenue, accounting for 87.65%.  &amp;#x200B;  And, Tesla electric car price cuts swept the world.  &amp;#x200B;  So, of course, we have to start our research with electric cars.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Here, to say one of my preconceived ideas when I started my research -  &amp;#x200B;  I always thought that Tesla selling cars is just a layout, like a big game, through the sale of cars to self-driving FSD software services to thousands of households is its ultimate goal.  &amp;#x200B;  After all, the software subscription and FSD gross margin straight up to 90%.  &amp;#x200B;  Currently Tesla's main revenue from electric vehicles is through the model series, as well as electric trucks and electric pickups.  &amp;#x200B;  In the future, Tesla is expected to launch a $10w class of electric vehicles to capture the low-end market and increase market share.  &amp;#x200B;  According to the distribution of Tesla's global revenue, it is as follows.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Currently it is dominated by the United States market, which is almost a clean sweep.  &amp;#x200B;  The Chinese market is growing rapidly and has become Tesla's second major battleground, but to be honest, it is also the strongest smoke and mirrors.  &amp;#x200B;  Of course, although the auto market is a competitive place, new energy vehicles are undoubtedly full of promise.  &amp;#x200B;  Although, a while ago, the epidemic led to a downturn in consumption, but the policy -  &amp;#x200B;  on the one hand, China's and the world's carbon-neutral carbon summits have continued to make new energy look good.  &amp;#x200B;  On the other hand, Shanghai continues to subsidize the replacement of new energy vehicles, giving 1W financial subsidy for replacement - may be the national wind vane to promote new energy.  &amp;#x200B;  At the same time, Musk also offered up his big killers: price cuts.  &amp;#x200B;  Outsiders see the fun, insiders see the doorway.  &amp;#x200B;  Behind this is still because of Tesla's scale advantage, and in the entire automotive industry unmatched \[high gross profit\].  &amp;#x200B;  Tesla's price reduction magic weapon, spread out to see, there are.  &amp;#x200B;  4680 large cylindrical battery technology, super factory, integrated die-casting technology automotive design (compressed inventory turnover days), parts supply localization, and the industry's Moore's Law + Wright's Law.  &amp;#x200B;  Note: These technologies will be explained in detail later in the article.  &amp;#x200B;  All this makes both traditional car companies and new car makers look beyond their reach.  &amp;#x200B;  Even the most responsive market "electric three idiots" -  &amp;#x200B;  Xiaopeng gross profit margin of 12.2%, Azera 13.6%, the ideal maximum 18.9%.  &amp;#x200B;  And in the first three quarters of 2022 operating losses Azera 8.9 billion yuan, Xiaopeng 6.2 billion yuan, the ideal 3.5 billion yuan.  &amp;#x200B;  And Tesla's gross margin, even with price cuts, has always been controlled at more than 25% -  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  So, he still has the bottom of the price cut.  &amp;#x200B;  Thus, looking around, Tesla's competitors seem to be left with BYD.  &amp;#x200B;  About who is competing with BYD to the next article, here is a brief summary of Tesla and my concerns so far.  &amp;#x200B;  Tesla's previous strategy is: high-end sports car cut into the market, and then take the market through model 3 mass production.  &amp;#x200B;  This is undoubtedly the right thing to do.  &amp;#x200B;  In the future, Tesla may want to sell cars to occupy the terminal, and then through software subscriptions and other Apple-like model long bound users - all this is happening, but the ultimate feasibility has yet to be verified.  &amp;#x200B;  While Tesla has seen its stock and sales rise in tandem by cutting prices, at the same time, Tesla's market share is declining year after year, both globally and in China and the United States.  &amp;#x200B;  Tesla's main rival in China, BYD, has seen its market share rise from 19.5% in 2021 to 31.7%, while Tesla's market share has fallen from 10.7% to 7.8% over the same period, according to data from the Passenger Association. .  Tesla's U.S. market share 79% (20 years), 71% (21 years), 65% (22 years Q3).  S&amp;P Global Automotive forecasts that by 2025, the number of U.S. electric vehicle models is expected to increase from the current 48 to 159, and Tesla's electric vehicle market share will fall to below 20%.  Perhaps, Tesla can control its gross margin, but market share is up to itself, its competitors and most importantly, user demand, can Tesla continue to occupy the public mind?  &amp;#x200B;  At the same time, although the price cut boosted sales at the moment, but the loss is the company's long-term competitive advantage and brand reputation.  &amp;#x200B;  For example, due to Tesla price cut old users rights, and the original high-end customer base are embarrassed to drive Tesla, instead of driving their old Mercedes-Benz or old BMW ......  &amp;#x200B;  Suddenly remembered Reid Hoffman in the "lightning expansion" there is a sentence -  &amp;#x200B;  The so-called entrepreneurship is the process of falling off a cliff in the rapid formation of parts into an aircraft that can be lifted.  &amp;#x200B;  The sense of urgency in this jumped off the page.  &amp;#x200B;  And Tesla, despite its nearly 20-year history, is still running rapidly, in order to continue to leave the competition, in order to replace the existing car ownership market of more than a billion, in order to Musk's "use of clean energy to continue human development" retroactive ......  &amp;#x200B;  That's all for today's analysis. Your attention is the biggest motivation for my daily progress.

[Could Tesla get hit substantially due to FSD revenue?,;,; Isn't $15K a lot of money for a product that doesn't really achieve what it says it does.

[Tesla trade based on it's own historical data,;,; **Tesla trade taken on 02/17/2023 predicting on what it will not do based on it‚Äôs own historical data.**  Wrote a vertical CALL 400/516.67 for 03/17/23 expiry for TSLA.  Quantity: 100 CALLs  Premium: $600  Portfolio Margin: $5,410  ‚ÄúOnce every 10 year‚Äù lose strike is 407.89  Most, if not all, stock market analysts attempt to divine what a stock or the stock market will do in the future.  They use fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and experience to predict the direction and potential levels to be reached before a potential turning point.  We, on the other hand, analyze what a stock, bond, ETF, or index is unlikely to do in the future based upon its own historical data.  Unlike RSI, Bollinger Bands, or other technical indicators that provide similar information, our measure uses the entire stock/ETF/index trading history to determine what the stock/ETF/index is unlikely to do.  So what is it??  We have developed a machine learning system that measures a symbols' percentage price change versus time for multiple time periods and compares the symbols recent price behavior to its own past to determine if the current behavior is anomalous.  Think of this as a measure of momentum run amok for the symbol.  Our experience has shown that there are two levels of anomalous stock/etf/index behavior that are of interest: (1) When the stock/etf/index current performance is outside of 99% of all prior instances (this is called a Level 1 overbought or oversold condition) and, (2) When the stock/etf/index current performance is outside the bounds of all of its prior history (this is called a Level 2 overbought or oversold condition).  We currently screen 600 stock/etf/index symbols every day - with more being added each week.  These symbols are all traded US stock market exchanges during normal US trading hours.  Figure 1, below, shows a subset of symbols screened for February 17, 2023  [Figure 1.  February 17, 2023 Stock Screener Subset](https://preview.redd.it/e4m303afn6ja1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d0975a9788a4e2728b082a3424f0067fbf643d2)  https://preview.redd.it/he20jp2kn6ja1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f1e49189205b41073de6291b1b6640a30b86acd1  https://preview.redd.it/unfret7ln6ja1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a897b2bb14eaf8c9a0023a6347e77d50e926602  So how can we use this overbought/oversold information??  The machine learning system that determines the overbought/oversold condition also provides threshold levels that correspond to what the symbol is unlikely to do in the FUTURE based upon where it is trading now.  Table 1, below, shows various levels and limits with different probabilities of occurrence for TSLA for a subset of future dates.  [Table 1.  TSLA Upper and Lower Closing Limits through March 17th, 2023](https://preview.redd.it/slxq8sgpn6ja1.png?width=994&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9ad8cd9b3079343ad155361e6efb00e5178f2f22)  In Table 1, above, we show five (5) columns corresponding to "No loss since inception", "Once Every 10 Years",  "Once Every 5 Years", ‚ÄúOnce Every 1 Years‚Äù, and "1% Raw Data".  Under each column header are sub-headers titled "Lower Limit" and "Upper Limit".  Under each of these sub-headers are prices that reflect what TSLA is unlikely to close below or above for varying probabilities defined the column header.  For instance, in the row corresponding to the 2/23/2023 date, we see a lower limit of 124.42 and upper limit of 312.32 under the No loss since inception column header.  This implies that TSLA closing below $124.42 or above $312.32 on Thursday, February 23, 2023 would be historical (something that's never happened before) on a percentage price change versus time basis.  Likewise, for the 03/17/2023 date, we see a lower limit of $93.82 and upper limit of $407.89 under the Once Every 10 Years header.  This implies that closing below $93.82 or above $407.89 on Friday, March 17th, 2023 would be expected to happen once every 10 years.  Given that there are approximately 252 trading days every year, no lose since inception corresponds to a likelihood of 1 in 2520 or 0.039%.  Finally, in the 1% Raw Data column, the prices reflect a 1% probability of closing below the indicated future lower limit prices or above the indicated future upper limit prices on the corresponding date based upon the entire history of TSLA - including what it's done recently.  So who could benefit from this data??  ‚Ä¢   Options Traders.  The primary beneficiaries of this type of information are options  traders.  By providing closing price levels for a symbol for a given future date, an option trader can write option positions with a known probability of success for both Put and Call options.  ‚Ä¢   Long/short strategies.  Knowing when a stock/ETF/index has moved too far, too fast is an important input in a buying/selling/shorting decision.  This screening decision is done automatically by the machine learning  computers on a daily basis.  The only thing the computer doesn't do is push the buy or sell button for you.  ‚Ä¢   Elliott Wave Practitioners.  Elliott Wave analysis can be a powerful tool for analyzing the likely path a stock/ETF/index may take higher or lower.  However, there are times when multiple paths may present themselves with near equal probability using Elliott Wave analysis alone.  However, many times, one or more possible paths would require the stock/ETF/index to move in a manner that would be unlikely to happen based upon the machine learning analysis.  ‚Ä¢   Fundamentalists.  All traders have two decisions to make:  When to buy and when to sell or vice versa.  A fundamental trader chooses to screen companies based upon fundamental analysis and makes buying decisions based upon this decision.  However, when does the fundamental trader choose to sell, buy more, etc.  The stock screening method explained in this paper can be a useful tool in helping make those decisions with exact price levels.,;,; 2023-02-19 17:52:13]

[Tesla or KBE this week?,;,; Just wanting some opinions on my situation. Critique me on my mindset as well, im still very new to this. As title says, I have holdings in KBE and Tesla with some earnings coming for both Tesla and several banks including Citi and JPMorgan. Tesla I‚Äôm down 6%, KBE I‚Äôm up 0.5%. Should I stay where I‚Äôm at? Drop KBE and dump into Tesla? Or Drop Tesla and flood KBE?  Thinking this week will be a tumultuous week for banks and maybe a rebound for Tesla since they‚Äôve been steady on deliveries so I‚Äôm leaning toward putting all into Tesla.  *I have diversified into other sectors, these aren‚Äôt my only two positions.

[Tesla stock extends record streak to 13 sessions,;,;    Tesla (TSLA) shares jumped 3.6% today, extending the company‚Äôs record winning streak to 13 sessions in a row. In that time, shares have risen nearly 42%, adding further gains to an already big year for Tesla shareholders.  Tesla stock is rising in tandem with the overall market today on cooling inflation data, but the shares have been on the rise for a couple of weeks now. The latest big news came late last week when General Motors (GM) announced it was joining forces with Tesla to leverage the electric vehicle maker's Supercharger Network. The companies announced the Tesla Supercharger Network will be open to GM EV drivers starting next year, and by 2025 GM anticipates its EVs will include Tesla‚Äôs NACs connector, which will allow for direct access to Tesla Superchargers.  GM‚Äôs move comes two weeks after Ford (F) announced a similar partnership with Tesla to enable access for Ford vehicles to Tesla's charging network.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/1w6kuajo6x5b1.png?width=732&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=432dcf945e44992a93a5f77cd6e5c1e0bb36436c  Nonetheless, it hasn‚Äôt all been good news for Tesla during the recent run-up, as the stock brushed aside negative reports about the upcoming and highly anticipated Cybertruck. Per leaked internal documents that German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on, as picked up by Wired, Tesla engineers have had some big concerns about the Cybertruck‚Äôs capabilities.  Preproduction ‚Äúalpha‚Äù versions of the Cybertruck were struggling with basic issues like suspension, body sealing, noise levels, handling, and braking, Wired reports. An automotive engineer Wired spoke with said a company like Tesla has the financial resources to address the issues, but the engineer was still ‚Äúastounded‚Äù that Tesla was struggling with some basic engineering issues with the Cybertruck.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk has nonetheless promised the company will hold a Cybertruck delivery event later in Q3, with limited production volumes beginning later this year.,;,; 2023-06-14 05:37:26]

[Tesla stock dips as analysts warn price cuts will weigh on margins,;,;    Tesla ($TSLA) shares are moving lower in premarket Monday after the electric vehicle (EV) maker delivered the fifth series of price cuts since January.  According to the company‚Äôs website, Tesla slashed prices on the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover by $1,000 and $2,000, respectively. The EV maker also cut prices on both versions of its more expensive Model S and Model X by $5,000.  ‚ÄúWe continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds, including Model S/X vehicles in transit to EMEA and APAC,‚Äù the company said in a press release.  The cuts come after Tesla said it delivered nearly 423,000 EV units in the first quarter. Several media outlets have reported that the company‚Äôs internal guidance is to deliver 2M cars in 2023 while analysts expect this number to be lower by around 10%.  Tesla is due to report its Q1 results on April 19.  **What analysts are saying about price cuts**  While Tesla is attempting to reaccelerate growth by offering cars at lower prices, analysts warn that the company‚Äôs margins could be at risk. The Street sees Tesla reporting a 21.1% auto gross margin for Q1.  Wells Fargo analysts believe Tesla will miss the &gt;20% target for auto gross margins. They also see Tesla reporting lower-than-expected EPS for the first quarter. Moreover, the analysts say Tesla will need to average \~526K deliveries from Q2 to Q4 to hit its 2M target.  ‚ÄúOur estimated auto gross margin ex credits of 18.3% is below guidance of &gt;20% and Visible Alpha (VA) consensus of 21.7%. We forecast ASPs for $46K, also below TSLA's target of &gt;$47K. Our Model 3/ Y pricing is down 12% vs. Q3, below our est. avg. price cut of 14%, reflecting model &amp; trim mix help,‚Äù they said in a note.  Citi analysts add that price cuts weren‚Äôt surprising and are likely to place a further focus on the Q1 auto gross margin.  ‚ÄúA stronger-than-expected gross margin outcome would support the contention that Tesla‚Äôs latest price cuts are coming from a position of cost strength while also possibly reflecting lower input costs. An in-line/softer gross margin outcome could revive concerns over capacity/product aging while placing 2023 consensus estimates at risk since they call for improving gross margins throughout the year,‚Äù they wrote in a note.  ‚ÄúAt \~46x ‚Äò23 consensus EPS, we don‚Äôt think the latter outcome is currently priced-in, making for a less than compelling risk/reward into the quarter under the current macro backdrop. We prefer staying opportunistic.‚Äù  Finally, Bernstein analysts expect Tesla to continue cutting prices to stimulate demand.  ‚ÄúWe note that lead times were relatively weak (&lt;4 weeks) for nearly all Tesla models in all geographies, \*except\* for the Model Y in the US. The fact that Tesla is cutting price on its longest lead time model suggests other price cuts are likely to follow, particularly since Model 3 SR rebates will fall $3750 on 4/18, and competition continues to intensify."  Given that they expect more price cuts, the analysts also don‚Äôt believe that Q1 margins may be the bottom. They expect Q1 auto gross margin of 20.5%, missing the 21.1% consensus.  ‚ÄúWe maintain that price cuts have and will undermine industry profitability (including Tesla's), but that incumbents are deep pocketed and not likely to back down. Some investors maintain that Tesla's recent price cuts reflect a structural cost advantage that will enable it to pressure rivals and capture outsize volume and dominate the EV market. Ultimately, we believe that the automotive market is hyper-competitive, and very difficult for any OEM to sustain an ongoing competitive cost advantage,‚Äù they finally concluded.

[Dow Jones rises but leaders tumble, and Tesla ($TSLA) stock triggers the sell rule.,;,;  Dow Jones futures were little changed early Thursday, along with S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The stock market rally struggled Wednesday as weak economic data raised recession fears for a second straight session.    The major indexes still don't look too bad, with the Nasdaq sliding but the Dow Jones rising.  But once again, declining stocks decisively beat winners. Once again, many of those losers fell hard. But on Wednesday, a lot of more of those big losers were leading stocks, such as **On Holding** ($**ONON**), **MarketAxess** ($**MKTX**) and **PagerDuty** ($**PD**). **C3.ai** ($**AI**) sold off for a second session, with the AI stock now staging a massive, outside week to the downside.  Others, including many chip names, declined solidly, now showing more chart damage after relatively modest retreats Tuesday.  **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) skidded for a third straight day, triggering the automatic sell rule.   Megacap techs such as **Apple** ($**AAPL**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**), Google parent **Alphabet** (**GOOGL**), **Meta Platforms** ($**META**) and **Nvidia** all fell.  Meanwhile, bank stocks came under more pressure. **Western Alliance Bancorp** (**WAL**) plunged, leading a retreat in regional banks, though they pared losses in the afternoon. **Charles Schwab**hit a two-year closing low. While bank deposits may be relatively safe, the bigger issue now may be long-term bank profitability as well as lending curbs that rapidly slow the economy.  Medical names are looking relatively strong, along with other defensive growth or defensive plays.  PagerDuty stock, On Holding, Meta and Nvidia are on **IBD Leaderboard**. Microsoft and Google stock are on the **IBD Long-Term Leaders** list.   Despite relatively benign action in the major indexes, the weakness in growth and other leading stocks is concerning. Investors should be looking to protect profits and cut losses.  ## Costco Sales Weak  Costco same-store sales fell 1.1% in March vs. a year earlier, the first decline in nearly three years. U.S. comps slid 1.5%. Excluding gasoline and currency effects, comps rose 2.6% or 0.9% in the U.S. E-commerce comps tumbled 11.6%. COST stock fell modestly.  ## Dow Jones Futures Today  Dow Jones futures edged higher vs. fair value. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.2%.  The Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. That follows unexpectedly weak February job openings and the March ADP Employment Report. Labor will release the March jobs report on Friday morning, but U.S. markets will be closed.   ## Stock Market Rally  The stock market rally had a generally negative session, despite the mixed action on the major indexes.  The ADP Employment Report showed private payrolls rose much less than expected in March, a day after a big drop in February job openings. The March ISM services index fell more than expected, signaling rapidly slowing growth.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% in Wednesday's **stock market trading**. The S&amp;P 500 index dipped 0.25%. The Nasdaq composite retreated 1.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 1%.  U.S. crude oil prices dipped 0.1% to $80.61 a barrel.  The 10-year Treasury yield declined 5 basis points to 3.285%. That's the lowest point in nearly seven months. The 2-year Treasury yield sank 7 basis points to 3.76%, off 34 basis points in the past four sessions.  ## ETFs  Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ($**FFTY**) shed 1.9%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ($**BOUT**) gave up 0.65%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ($**IGV**) slipped 1.3%. Microsoft stock and a few other heavyweights dominate IGV, while more-speculative software names like PagerDuty suffered bigger losses. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([**SMH**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) gave up 1.75%, with NVDA stock a major holding.  Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF ($**ARKK**) slumped 3.6% and ARK Genomics ETF (**ARKG**) shed 1.8%. TSLA stock is the top holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. Some Ark funds also own PD stock.  SPDR S&amp;P Metals &amp; Mining ETF (**XME**) retreated 1.15% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (**PAVE**) 1.7%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (**JETS**) and SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (**XHB**) descended 1.5%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (**XLE**) climbed 1.5% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (**XLV**) rallied 1.7% to its best level since Feb. 14.  ## Bank Stocks  The Financial Select SPDR ETF (**XLF**) edged down 0.1%, with SCHW stock a top 10 holding. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (**KRE**), which includes WAL stock, sank 1% but finished off lows.  Western Alliance stock plunged as much as 19.4% after releasing some financial metrics but not disclosing deposits. Shares came off their lows as the California-based bank disclosed deposits fell 11% on March 31 vs. the end of 2022, not as bad as some feared. Still, WAL stock closed down 12.4%.,;,; 2023-04-06 11:23:50]

[Tesla ($TSLA) stock and six other tech titans are responsible for 86% of the S&amp;P 500 2023 performance.,;,;    Tesla($TSLA) stock **plunged nearly 10% last week on earnings**. That caught everyone's attention, but it was just the tip of the iceberg.  0 seconds of 14 secondsVolume 0%   With roughly one-third of the S&amp;P 500 companies **announcing quarterly earnings results this week**, there are none bigger than tech titans **Alphabet** ($**GOOGL**), **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**) and **Meta Platforms** ($META). These four Big Tech stocks alone account for 41% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 year-to-date gain, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.  Adding **Apple** ($**AAPL**), which reports next week, **Nvidia** ($**NVDA**) and **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) stock, Colas says these seven tech giants account for 86% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 gain, which was 7.7% through Monday's close. These seven Big Tech stocks have rallied far more than the S&amp;P 500 this year.  According to Colas, there have been three drivers of outperformance for these tech leaders. First, all seven were deeply oversold at the end of 2022 and received a "January Effect" bounce.  The January Effect is a seasonal increase in stock prices throughout the month of January. The increase in demand for stocks in January is often preceded by a decrease in prices during the month of December, in part due to tax-loss harvesting.     Second, many of these tech companies have been aggressively cutting costs, so earnings power should now be higher than last year. And, finally, interest rates have declined, supporting the valuation of high-multiple stocks, he added.  ## Alphabet, Microsoft Earnings Due  Google-owner Alphabet reports earnings after the closing bell Tuesday. Shares are just below a 106.69 buy point in a **cup with handle**, according to **IBD MarketSmith** chart analysis.  Alphabet earnings are expected to measure $1.08 a share on revenue of $68.8 billion.  Dow Jones software giant Microsoft slid almost 2% midday Tuesday, threatening to extend a losing streak to four sessions ahead of the company's earnings results late Tuesday. MSFT stock is rolling back toward a 276.86 buy point in a **flat base** following a March 17 breakout.  Wall Street expects Microsoft to earn $2.24 a share on revenue of $51.0 billion, per FactSet estimates.     ## Amazon, Meta Earnings Also On Deck  E-commerce giant Amazon continues to trace the right side of a **cup base**, but is seeing resistance around its long-term 200-day moving average.  With earnings due out late Thursday, Amazon is expected to earn 21 cents a share on sales of $124.5 billion.  Facebook parent Meta Platforms will report Wednesday after the stock market closes. Meta stock is out of buy range past a **197.26 buy point** in a flat base, but receding.  The social media giant is expected to earn $2.02 a share on revenue of $27.6 billion.  ## Apple Earnings Next Week  Apple shares reversed squarely lower midday Tuesday. Still, they remain solidly above a 157.48 buy point and at the top of the **5% buy range** that runs up to 165.35.  The Dow Jones tech giant reports its fiscal second-quarter results on May 4. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to earn $1.43 a share on sales of $92.9 billion.     ## Nvidia Holds Up; Tesla Stock Breaks Down  Graphics-chip maker Nvidia remains near its recent highs despite sharp losses midday Tuesday. Shares declined more than 2% in afternoon trade.  The **IBD Leaderboard stock** broke out past a 230.59 handle buy point after the **company's strong earnings on Feb. 23**.  Electric-vehicle giant Tesla stock continues to trade near its lowest level since Jan. 26. In recent weeks, shares triggered the **7%-8% loss rule** from a buy point at 200.76 in a cup with handle.

CEO Elon Musk plans to reveal his "Master Plan 3" with analysts predicting announcements including a new Tesla EV platform, confirmation of a planned Mexico factory and potential Tesla Model 3 upgrades.  The event, at Tesla's Austin, Texas, factory, will begin with keynote presentations before turning to a Q&amp;A segment with analysts expecting a big announcement on a new cheaper EV platform, updates on the Cybertruck as well as other news.  Tesla may also confirm a long-rumored "Project Highland" Model 3 upgrade. Reuters reported Wednesday an upgraded Model 3, with an emphasis on lower production costs, will go into production in September at the company's Shanghai facility. Tesla is also updating the Model Y with interior and exterior changes with a 2024 production target, according to Reuters.  "The thing to look for this year is the Gen 3 platform, which is key to growth as it will allow lower-cost EVs which should boost volume as demand stalls and competition ramps up," Third Bridge analyst Orwa Mohamad wrote late Tuesday.  Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador also announced Tuesday Tesla plans to build a manufacturing plant in Monterrey. Additional details will be released Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported.  Tesla has repeatedly teased an EV that would sit around the $25,000 price point. CFO Zachary Kirkhorn, during the Q4 earnings call, said the "next-generation vehicle platform" was a priority. This could mean the cheaper, elusive, Tesla Model 2 could be floated on March 1.  ## Tesla Stock Performance  TSLA shares rose dropped 2.4% to 200.79 during Wednesday's [**market trade**](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/stock-market-today-market-trends-best-stocks-buy-watch/).

The company is currently in talks with Tesla about adopting this connector for its Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, and future Scout brands in the region.  **2)** **Tesla set for record quarter in China.**  Analysts predict that Tesla is likely to achieve a new sales record in China despite competition from local rivals. Estimates suggest Tesla could sell around 155,000 cars in China from April to June, marking a 13% increase from the previous quarter, although its market share may decline slightly due to increased competition from companies like BYD and Aion.  **3) Tesla sales forecast for Q2: 440,000-450,000 deliveries.**  As the second quarter comes to a close, Tesla remains the dominant force in the electric vehicle market, with estimated sales forecasts for Q2 ranging from 441,000 to 448,000 vehicles. The Model Y is expected to outpace other models, and while Tesla's production is increasing, concerns arise regarding the gap between production and deliveries. The upcoming release of the Cybertruck and a lower-cost Tesla model are seen as crucial for sustaining Tesla's growth.  **4)** **Elon vs. Zuck: it's officially happening.**  Tech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have engaged in social media banter about a potential cage fight between them, generating publicity and attention.

[Best Stocks for Long-Term Investment Discussion (2023),;,; THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. You do not search for proper financial advice on Reddit. And also, I am a dumbass. Feel free to correct me in the comments if I get things wrong.  I've been wondering about the best stocks to invest on for long-term.  IMO, a stock is great for investment if it can grow at a certain percentage. What I mean by this is that, the numbers are not important compared to the percentages. For example, Company A, worth $100B, increasing in value to $300B is better than company B, worth $2T, increasing in value to 2.6T, even though Company B earns more.  Here are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this):  1. Nvidia  I think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030. Combined with its current not-that-high worth of around $600B, Nvidia might actually reach $10T in 2030, and anyone investing before the boom might feel the stonks.  2. TSMC  The most advanced semiconductor provider in the world, TSMC might be the one that will supply the cloth for Nvidia's pants, if that makes sense. It is basically a monopoly at this point. The most advanced AI processing companies might buy their wafer from this one company. Its current worth is also not that high, around $400B.  What I don't think are great for investment:  1. Google/Alphabet  Google's AI is great and all, but YouTube, man. YouTube is such a mess for Google. YouTube really inhibits them from increasing in value. They probably operate YouTube at a loss, and I can't blame them. They have to prepare datacenters to store thousands of 10-hour black screen videos uploaded at 4K 60FPS.  2. Tesla  I, as someone who's not a Westerner, do not know what Tesla's appeal. Are electric cars that profitable? And their AI is, like, weird. Unless they come out to be the first company to sell, like, a fully-functional humanoid AI robot, I am not sure if Tesla can really be great for investment. I can be REALLY wrong here, so let me know if I am and why.  And lastly, let me know other companies that you think are great for long-term investment.,;,; 2023-04-29 09:34:58]
[P/E ratio for growth stocks,;,; Should you use the median P/E ratio (last 5years) of growth stocks to value them? I know that P/E ratio above 30- 35 are difficult to keep over long period of times, but many growth stocks have median P/E ratios than exceed 35 by a lot. So it's ok to suppose that a growth stock will match its median P/E ratio again or should I use a lower p/ e ratio for the estimates(maybe the median P/E ratio for companies in the same industry? ) In general, how long can growth stocks keep a high P/E ratio? As an example I have Tesla. Right now is P/E ratio is 68. And its median P/E ratio last years was 179.

It reported a lower-than-anticipated loss per share of $1.38, although losses widened considerably compared to $0.19 in the prior-year quarter.¬† ¬†¬†     The average revenue per user (ARPU) declined 5% year-over-year to $40.67. The company expects advertising spend to remain under pressure throughout this year due to macro challenges.  ## Is Roku a Good Stock to Buy?  Following the Q1 results in late April, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein maintained a Buy rating on Roku stock but lowered his price target to $75 from $85. Explaining his investment stance, the analyst stated that platform revenue has stabilized, with upcoming tailwinds from advertisers, agencies, retail media, and DSP integrations.  Given headwinds from slowing ad spend by subscription video on-demand (SVOD) providers and higher ‚Äúscatter market exposure,‚Äù Helfstein expects Roku to be one of the first beneficiaries of any recovery in the ad market.  Wall Street‚Äôs Moderate Buy consensus rating on Roku is based on 11 Buys, seven Holds, and three Sells. The average price target of $69.74 implies about 25% upside. ¬†  ¬†¬†¬†   https://preview.redd.it/0gffnzk39cza1.png?width=685&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98721a37e42b6a999501d1ba0065f409be3f4309     ## Tesla ($TSLA)  Investors were unimpressed with Tesla‚Äôs first-quarter performance, as the company‚Äôs earnings declined due to the impact of price cuts on margins. The company also cited underutilization of new factories, higher raw material, commodity, logistics, and warranty costs, and lower revenue from environmental credits as the reasons for margin contraction.     During the Q1 earnings call CEO Elon Musk justified the company‚Äôs pricing strategy, saying that a focus on higher volumes and a larger fleet is the ‚Äúright choice‚Äù than lower volumes and higher margins. Musk expects Tesla‚Äôs vehicles to generate significant profit over time through its autonomy feature.  Following multiple price cuts, Tesla recently hiked the prices of several cars in the U.S., Canada, China, and Japan. Nonetheless, prices remain lower than the levels seen at the start of this year.     ## Is Tesla a Buy, Hold, or Sell?  Earlier this month, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter lowered his price target to $280 from $300 but reiterated a Buy rating. The analyst reduced his 2023-2025 estimates to reflect price cuts and their impact on margins. While Potter agrees with management's view that margins will eventually rise due to software, he contends that this won't happen quickly enough to offset the near-term impact of lower prices, higher warranty costs, and slower inventory turnover.  On the positive side, Potter thinks that the global average selling price (ASP) could fall by \~$125 per unit every quarter for the next two years without hurting margins due to production credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.  Until margins and other fundamentals start improving, Potter believes that TSLA might struggle to ‚Äúcatch a bid.‚Äù¬†Nevertheless, he remains bullish on the stock and expects investors to turn around in the second half of the year and beyond.   Wall Street‚Äôs Moderate Buy consensus rating on Tesla is based on 15 Buys, 12 Holds, and four Sells. The average price target of $202.15 suggests nearly 20% upside.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/t2pdkftb9cza1.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5c3526300ba871ed77dd6123740e354f29e7a38     ## Block ($SQ)  Shares of fintech Block declined sharply in March after short-seller Hindenburg Research accused the company of inflating the number of users on its Cash App system. The company shook off these concerns by reporting better-than-expected Q1 2023 results last week.  Adjusted EPS jumped 122% to $0.40 in Q1 2023, driven by a 26% rise in revenue to about $5 billion and enhanced margins. Results gained from solid momentum in the company‚Äôs Cash App peer-to-peer ecosystem. Cash App‚Äôs gross profit increased 49% to $931 million. Meanwhile, Square, the company‚Äôs ecosystem focused on merchants, delivered a gross profit of $770 million, up 16% from the prior-year quarter.  Based on the gross profit momentum in Q1, the company increased its full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook to $1.36 billion from the previous guidance of $1.30 billion. ¬†¬†  ## What is the Price Target for SQ Stock?  Following Block‚Äôs results, Needham analyst Mayank Tandon reiterated a Buy rating on the stock but lowered his price target to $80 from $95, given the lower market valuations for stocks in the payments space.     The analyst highlighted that Q1 results beat expectations because the robust momentum in the Cash App business offset softer seller trends as volumes faded during the quarter. Tandon remains positive on Block based on the company‚Äôs focus on driving profitable long-term growth and an expanding product suite as payments continue to shift to digital channels.  With 23 Buys and seven Holds, Square earns Wall Street‚Äôs Strong Buy consensus rating. At $91.19, the average price target suggests 58.5% upside.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/kvwznfmg9cza1.png?width=696&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=814bbc24a177e04332680dd12200179a146fb3b3     ## Conclusion  Block shares have underperformed Tesla and Roku stocks so far this year. However, analysts are more bullish about Block and see higher upside potential in the stock compared to the other two growth stocks.,;,; 2023-05-12 05:58:31]
[Any historical companies like big tech?,;,; Hi all, I'm trying to win a debate here.  I am all for passive ETF investing while my friend thinks that he can pick exceptionally performing stocks easily and thinks he can continue to earn a tidy profit by investing in Apple or Tesla.  So my understanding is it's difficult to accurate pick stocks for laymen like us. But besides that, I want to know if there were any companies in history where everyone thought the stock price will just keep going up and up and nobody could have thought the prices will dip and eventually it did and never recovered?  And also, what are you opinions on whether the current set of big tech firms that seems so invincible now, will they go down that path?   Thank you,;,; 2023-10-05 15:02:17]

[Buying shares post-split: good or bad idea?,;,; Many stock splits have occurred in recent years, with companies aiming to increase liquidity within shares and erase barriers to entry for potential investors.  Of course, it's critical to remember that a split does not directly impact a company's financial position or performance.  Several companies ‚Äì  Tesla (TSLA $**TSLA**), Alphabet (GOOGL $**GOOGL**), Palo Alto Networks (PANW $**PANW**), and Shopify (SHOP $**SHOP**) ‚Äì have all split their shares over the last year.  It raises a valid question: is buying post-split a good strategy? Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the performance of each post-split.  **Tesla**  In June of 2022, the mega-popular EV manufacturer announced a three-for-one stock split; shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis on August 25th, 2022.  Since the split, Tesla shares have declined by 45% in value, coming nowhere near the general market‚Äôs performance.

Shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis on July 18th, 2022.  Alphabet shares have retraced 3.5% in value post-split so far, again underperforming relative to the general market.  https://preview.redd.it/u4euu4rqcsva1.png?width=664&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4333ebfb94471c99ba69bb15099bb28fe37afe2c  The quarterly earnings estimate has been revised to roughly 5% lower since January, as illustrated below.

[4 rental properties &amp; home paid off, no mortgages/loans. 30 years old. What should I invest in with an additional $100k? (Advice Needed),;,; **Hi team.**  **I've been investing the wrong way, and i need help.** So for the last 4 years, I've been buying real estate with no mortgages. All cash. This cash wasn't in an HYSA or MMF. Every dollar I've ever had was/is sitting in a Wells Fargo checking account. Currently, I have over $100,000 in this same Wells Fargo checking account (not even in their savings account). Now, I realize **how wrong I am** by having that amount of money sitting there.  **My current investments are the following:**  * 4 rental properties (Paid off, In Florida, generating $7,150/month.) * My home (Paid off). * 2 Stocks (NIO &amp; Tesla). I invested in NIO 3 years ago and have an average cost basis of $48. It's worth $7 right now. Big, big loss. I've not sold any, and I'm not planning to (Pride?). The total investment on NIO is $120k, now worth around $20k. 3 months ago, I invested in Tesla, $30k, and that's the only stock that's up. My average cost basis in Tesla is $155/share, now worth around $180/share. * My car (It's paid off, although it's an old 2010 BMW worth around 4k lol. I might change it soon as my girlfriend complains that I'm constantly using her car lol.).  I have no debt, and my monthly expenses are around 2000 to 3000/month (Yearly property taxes/12, HOA fees of the condo I'm living in, and that's it. My girlfriend pays the rest (food and light, as I'm handling the HOA fees).  My monthly income varies, but for the last 4 years, it has always been over $10,000 (without counting the rental properties income).  I know that I've been a lucky person but also a workaholic, and I've achieved many positive things as a 30-year old, but I'm missing exposure to index funds in my portfolio. I forgot to mention that I'm an immigrant from Spain and a current U.S. Resident, so the culture of index funds, stock investment, money market funds, high-yield savings accounts, etc., wasn't taught to me. So I've always been doing what I knew best, working as much as possible and investing earnings in purchasing real estate.  So, I've heard the term "mutual funds" before, but I never really dug much into it. A few days ago, I started reading more about it and came across the terms "HYSA and Money market funds". After reading about it, I couldn't believe I've been saving my money terribly (I even called Fidelity to confirm that these HYSA and money market fund avg. returns exist).  So now, I plan to change how I manage my money.  **What I'm currently doing when I get paid:**  1. My paystub goes directly into my business Wells Fargo checking account. 2. I hold it there until there's a buying opportunity (Like a property). Remember, I don't save 10-15k for a down payment but 150-300k for a cash purchase.  **What I'm planning on doing AFTER investing a lump sum of 100k in an ETF index fund:**  1. My paystub goes directly into my business Wells Fargo checking account. 2. I keep 5k in my Wells Fargo business account and transfer the rest to my Fidelity account. 3. Once the money goes to Fidelity, 20% will go to an ETF index fund (I'd like suggestions on which one(s), maybe VOO?), and the other 80% into SPAXX (MMF). 4. Wait until the next buying opportunity (like a real estate opportunity) and pull from the MMF.  So, as a 30-year old, I'm already late to the party of the ETF index funds, and I'm plan on investing 100k in an ETF index fund to catch up with the years of not investing.  **My questions are:**  1. Is the approach of only having 5k in a basic Wells Fargo checking account and transferring everything else to a Fidelity MMF (80%) and an index fund(20%), savvy? 2. Which ETF(s) index fund should I invest in? I like conservative but also something that's quite heavy in tech, as I'm a big tech believer.  P.S. I'm not much interested in mutual funds because of the taxes of the fund selling and buying activity every year) or retirement accounts, as I'm not really looking forward to becoming a multi-millionaire by then, but earlier (hopefully)). I'm fine with paying taxes on dividends and when I sell the ETF index funds.  I appreciate your help, as i feel so lost with everything I'm reading about ETF index funds, MMF, high-yield savings accounts, etc.,;,; 2023-05-28 23:52:01]

[Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY?,;,; A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data.

For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. * Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.  It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.  I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:  1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. 2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&amp;P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. 3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. 4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. 5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. 6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.  It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.  **What are your thoughts?**,;,; 2024-01-24 21:46:21]

[Dr. Techy| What if Elon Musk invested OpenAI instead of Twitter?,;,; Elon Musk, one of the richest men in the world, has seen two companies he‚Äôs played a big role in‚ÄîTwitter and OpenAI‚Äîhead in two very different directions.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/crsuknueevqa1.png?width=375&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=782ac5252446d6c754c18b4afc52ee51344de9a7  Just one month before Microsoft-backed OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT revived popularity of artificial intelligence across the globe, Tesla‚Äôs CEO Elon Musk took the social media platform Twitter private with **$44 billion**¬†in late October. The largest social network suffered a steep drop in value ever since.   Twitter, to which Musk has been giving his all, is not wriggling out troubles. Musk even said that Twitter might go bankrupt. Although the remark was changed later, Twitter still involved too much energy from Musk. Musk now values Twitter at about **$20 billion**, halved compared with his buyout price, according to an internal email.  As for OpenAI‚Äîmaker of AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT‚ÄîMusk cofounded it and helped get it started in 2015 with a donation of about **$100 million**. After being rebuffed to take over the AI startup, Musk and his money walked away in 2018 and focused on electric vehicle business. And OpenAI soon succumbed to Microsoft‚Äôs **$1 billion**¬†embrace to cover operation costs.  This year, Microsoft upsized investment to **$10 billion**¬†(now **$13 billion**¬†in total) into the San Fancisco-based AI research company and pounced on the chance to integrate the AI tools into its products, like search engine Bing and Office suites. The new Bing Chat feature has put Microsoft‚Äôs search engine in the spotlight recently and hits over **100 million active users**¬†in bid to grab share from its rival Google. And Google is feeling the pressure and stepping up AI development.

Whatever Musk‚Äôs reasons were, OpenAI quickly underwent significant changes. In 2019, it transitioned from a nonprofit to a ‚Äúcapped-profit‚Äù model and received the first of several large investments from Microsoft, which helped it with the vast computing resources required for AI tools like ChatGPT.  The Microsoft-backed AI pioneer‚Äôs valuation has skyrocketed. According to the Wall Street Journal, the company was in talks earlier this year to sell existing shares in a tender offer valued at about **$29 billion**, up from about **$14 billion**¬†in 2021.  Along with divergence, OpenAI cofounders Sam Altman and Elon Musk have been increasingly sniping at one other. OpenAI is leading a **$23.5 million**¬†investment in 1X, a startup that creates human-like robots. And OpenAI's foray into robotics could put it in direct competition with Musk's Tesla, which has been promising to launch a bipedal, humanoid robot called the Tesla Bot or Optimus since mid-2021.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/fnmqvxbhevqa1.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a113b2d7f08b886ca4058420989309278fd8c2a  In response, Musk joined over 1,000 researchers and supporters in calling for an immediate pause on the creation of ‚Äúgiant‚Äù AIs for at least 6 months. His signature in the joint letter indicates that Tesla is lagging in the AI race and is attempting to catch up.  Initially, Musk had a different opinion about OpenAI's chatbot. Musk called ChatGPT "scary good" in a December tweet, adding that "we are not far from powerful and dangerous artificial intelligence."  Elon Musk intended to establish a new research lab to create a competitor to OpenAI's popular text-based chatbot. The lab's focus would be on AI research, with no immediate plans to develop specific products. Though it is never too late to start a business, Open AI has a head start. The Tesla and Twitter CEO has to face a massive technological "gap," which he will not be able to catch up with harsh words alone.  So, what will happen if Elon Musk didn‚Äôt pour money into Twitter deal but invested OpenAI? Dr. Techy believes, Mr. Musk will not lose his $20-plus billion in the social media platform valuation for nothing.  On 1994, Yahoo released searching engine.

In addition, Palantir is now [eligible](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/palantir-stock-forecast-pltr-price-surges-21-after-q3-earnings-beat-on-top-and-bottom-202311021434) for inclusion in the S&amp;P 500, signifying its growing importance in the financial market.  The company's [third-quarter earnings](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-movers-0fab2fba) report indicates a notable shift towards the commercial market, reducing its reliance on government contracts (55% actually). Furthermore, Palantir has achieved profitability for the fourth consecutive quarter. It's worth noting that the company is debt-free and holds $3.3 billion in cash and short-term equivalents.  From a technical perspective, it's important to be cautious as there isn't a clear long-term support level for the stock. Currently, the stock is trading at over 15 times its projected 2023 revenue, with earnings expected to grow at a rate exceeding 80% per year (PE ratio reduction can be due to earning increase or value reduction).  However, Palantir still needs to focus on increasing its profit margin, which stood at 1%, 2%, and 7% in the last three quarters, respectively.  Is Palantir destined to become the next major tech company, or is it simply generating hype without substantial substance?  Thank you,;,; 2023-11-05 07:52:58]

[No rizz,;,; ,;,; 2023-05-17 04:59:33]
[What's going on with Rivian?,;,; Rivian Automotive is a startup electric vehicle company. A few years ago, Rivian was one of the most hyped companies to IPO. But recently, the company has been characterized by its poor financial performance. Rivian has blown through billions of dollars and has shown no sign of stopping. In FY 2022, the company reported a loss of almost $7 billion. Figures like this have spooked investors and the company‚Äôs share price has suffered as a result. The company currently trades around $14.48, down -88.86% from its IPO. Is Rivian a bust, or is there a promising future for the EV startup?  One bright spot has been the company‚Äôs increasing revenue. The company went from not reporting any revenue in FY 2020 to sales of $55 million in FY 2021, to $1.7 billion in FY 2022. This upward trend gives investors reason to be excited about Rivian‚Äôs future. When Rivian reported Q1 earnings on May 9, it reported revenue of $661 million for that quarter. Compared to Q1 of last year, this represents a 600% increase. Also, Rivian executives stressed their plans for profitability, which sent stock prices soaring.¬†  However, some larger issues still remain. Rivian is being forced to compete not only with rival Tesla, but other legacy automakers jumping into the EV race such as General Motors and Ford Motor Company. If Rivian doesn‚Äôt establish a strong foothold in the electric vehicle market soon, it may lose its opportunity to establish a presence in this growing market.¬†  I believe Rivian is an all-or-nothing play. Investing in the stock is extremely risky. However, the stock is poised for explosive returns if the company can work out its financial issues and deliver quality products to millions of customers that demand them. Currently, the company sits on $12 billion in cash and just shy of $3 billion in debt. According to FactSet, the target price for Rivian Automotive is $23.95, which reflects positive sentiment for the company even as it struggles.,;,; 2023-06-06 11:50:36]

[Stock Market Today (as of Mar 15, 2023),;,; Last night, the three major US stock indexes fluctuated and closed higher, with regional banks rebounding and semiconductors leading the market. At the close, the Dow Jones rose 1.06%, the Nasdaq rose 2.14%, and the S&amp;P rose 1.65%.  The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds rose 3.754% to close at 3.676%, with a spread of -56 basis points compared to the yield on 2-year Treasury bonds. The VIX fell 10.52%, Brent crude oil fell 3.78%, and spot gold has been on an upward trend since November 2022, but it fell 0.51% yesterday to $1903.8/ounce. The US dollar index continued to fall from its high, closing at 103.67.  The US CPI has risen steadily in February due to the high cost of rent, with a month-on-month increase of 0.4% and a year-on-year increase of 6.0%, which is in line with expectations. There is uncertainty among economists as to whether the increase in inflation will be enough to push the Fed to raise interest rates again next week, especially after the bankruptcy of two regional banks. Some economists, including Goldman Sachs, predict that the Fed will pause the current fast monetary policy tightening cycle since the 1980s to avoid the spread of the banking crisis, while financial markets still expect the Fed to raise interest rates by 25 basis points. CME's "Fed Watch" reflects the mixed opinions among economists regarding the Fed's next move.  The Wall Street Journal reports that the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Silicon Valley Bank's information disclosure and executive trading. Signature Bank is being sued for providing false statements to customers, and a proposed class-action lawsuit aims to obtain compensation from the bank. Moody's has stated that the operating environment for the US banking system is quickly deteriorating, with a negative outlook.  The US military has accused a Russian fighter jet of intercepting and destroying a US drone in the Black Sea. The US government has notified its allies and is in direct communication with Russian officials to express its opposition to the incident. The Russian ambassador to the US has been called in for discussions. The Russian side denies the allegations and claims that the drone was not deliberately targeted and lost control due to a sudden maneuver.  **Trending Stocks**  [**First Republic Bank(FRC)**](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-FRC/)  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/3fmgnwrjcwna1.png?width=1213&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cf10c45463b17c7161f5bad6e076166c2ef04c3  FRC, which was down 61.83% on Monday, was up nearly 28% yesterday, and traded up another 8.45% in the post-market.

[Is Lucid Motors a buy,;,;  Luxury EV maker Lucid Group Inc announced on February 22, 2023, that it expects to produce 9,000 to 14,000 of its luxury electric vehicles this year, up from 7,180 cars produced last year. This is below the average analyst expectation of 21,815 cars, according to Visible Alpha. Lucid's Q4 2022 revenue was $257.7 million, which is an increase from $26.4 million the previous year, but still fell short of analysts' predictions of $302.6 million. However, Lucid's net loss decreased significantly from the previous year, standing at $472.6 million or 28 cents per share, compared with $1.05 billion or 64 cents per share the year before. The company's fourth-quarter revenue missed Wall Street's expectations, with fewer cars delivered than produced. It has been difficult for the luxury EV maker to compete in the market due to the price war initiated by Tesla Inc and Ford Motor Co, which has made it harder for Lucid and other competitors such as Rivian Automotive Inc to gain market share.,;,; 2023-02-23 12:53:48]

Now I see all of my friends starting to invest, which is great! Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve inspired them. The issue is they are being exceptionally dumb with where they put their money, evenmoreso then I was, and I‚Äôve been there and done that, so it inspired me to make a Tik Tok page about the bare bones education needed to start investing; aka what a stock is, the way you make money from it(capgains &amp; dividends), why you probably shouldn‚Äôt buy individual stocks like Tesla as a beginner, what an etf/index fund is, and why that‚Äôs usually the best course of action for a beginner.  During the creation of this TikTok account, I remembered a story from my junior year of high school that my history teacher told about Joseph Kennedy, who I believe was JFKs dad/gdad or something like that. The story that he was going about his day like normal, decided to get his shoes shined, and the kid shining his shoes asked him for stock advice. This led him to question if stocks were becoming overvalued because of massive amounts of demand coming even from literal children, and because of this, he sold a large amount of his assets right before the depression completely crash the market. I almost wonder if this isn‚Äôt a similar situation we faced today? Maybe it‚Äôs just the circle that I‚Äôm in, but it seems like a lot mindless, aggressive, yet passive investing is happening right now. If an 18 y/o is making an account to inform his friends maybe this whole thing has gone too far. Money just pouring into the market. I just wanted to share and see y‚Äôall‚Äôs responses. I love that my friends are investing but I do have a mild amount of fear that we are experiencing some overspeculation, which is why I‚Äôll never mindlessly pour, I like to invest in my index funds on red days lol.,;,; 2023-12-30 08:36:02]

[Is Catherine Duddy Wood's ETF Fund a Long-Term Investment Choice?,;,;       After reading articles about investments for some time, I have come to the conclusion that Catherine Wood's ETFs are among the best ETFs available. Compared to the traditional S&amp;P 500 index and Vanguard ETFs, which typically yield returns of around 7-15% over the past few years, Catherine's ETFs have provided returns of 300%.     In February 2018, Wood expressed her belief on CNBC that Tesla's stock price would reach $4,000 within five years, which was 11 times its price at that time.     Reality has provided an answer. After only six years in the market, Wood and her Ark Investment Management have become a hot investment institution on Wall Street. Fueled by the bull market in tech stocks, five out of the seven ETFs managed by Wood have an average return of 141%, far surpassing industry averages.     Many people attribute her success to luck, but when describing tech stocks, she said, "I believe there is no tech bubble, everything that's happening now was planted 30 years ago, and we are ready for the golden age."     In early 2022, Wood's other eight funds, including those focused on financial technology and space exploration, were among the worst performers in their categories. However, I still have faith in her foresight for the future.     Wood has consistently supported everything shaping the future today, with enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies, artificial intelligence, renewable energy, the human genome, robotics, 3D printing, and even space exploration.     She has also mentioned that while her investment style may appear risky today, it is fundamentally not much different from that of Warren Buffett and others. The difference lies in her focus on finding companies that are considered valuable today but will become valuable in the future.

[Summary of recent news, and the impact on U.S. stocks,;,;  **U.S. March nonfarm payrolls data mixed, leaving door open for another Fed rate hike in May**  U.S. nonfarm payrolls growth slowed to 236,000 in March, below expectations of 239,000 and the smallest increase since December 2020.  The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, compared with a forecast of 3.6 percent. Average hourly earnings rose 0.3% from a year earlier, compared with a forecast of 0.3%.  With the release of the nonfarm payrolls data, one of the Fed's two most closely watched indicators - employment and inflation - firmed, U.S. bond yields lifted across the board, and the swap agreement showed the Fed's next FOMC meeting in May with another 25 basis point rate hike probability of about 75%.  **Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Summers: U.S. recession possibility rises, Fed nears end of rate hike**  Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Summers said the Fed is coming to the end of interest rate hikes after a series of weak economic indicators were released and the possibility of a U.S. recession is on the rise. Commenting on the Fed's May rate meeting, Summers said it is clear that we are in the final stages of the current tightening cycle. Whether it is necessary to take action again, I think this is a judgment they should wait until the last minute.  **Hedge funds: the Fed policy is about to turn, the dollar may depreciate 15% in a year and a half**  British hedge fund Eurizon SLJ Capital released a report saying that the dollar could fall another 10 to 15 percent in the next year and a half as inflation cools and the Federal Reserve is about to ease monetary policy. Stephen Jen, the firm's chief executive, said the Fed may be very close to or may even have crossed the peak of its hawkish stance, and that means a rate cut is coming.  **Bank of America: How OPEC + Production Cuts Impacted April CPI Data**  Bank of America said the impact of the Opec + voluntary production cuts on the economy and monetary policy is likely to be fairly small. That's despite headlines that it adds to an already complicated outlook for rate hikes, creating upside risks for inflation and Fed policy. But the bank sees it differently. Bofa thinks Opec's production cuts should create a small upside risk to inflation and a small downside risk to growth. Even if oil prices remain at current levels, the energy CPI component of the April CPI report is likely to decline slightly, as the lagged impact of earlier declines in oil prices outweighed Monday's gains.  **Undeterred by the banking crisis, individual investors in U.S. stocks still plunge into bank stocks**  Despite the ongoing crisis in the U.S. banking sector, the market still has doubts about the outlook for the banking sector and the U.S. economy, but U.S. retail investors continued to plunge into hard-hit bank stocks in the first quarter, pumping money into heavyweight stocks such as U.S. banks. According to data from Vanda Research, net buying of U.S. bank stocks soared to $769 million in the first quarter of this year, surpassing even the buying of retail concepts such as $Nifty ([NFLX.US](https://nflx.us/))$ and $Rivian Automotive ([RIVN.US](https://rivn.us/))$ in the same period. The company said retail investors even bought more than $200 million in shares of troubled $First Republic Bank ([FRC.US](https://frc.us/))$ during the period.  **Price war intensifies! Tesla cuts prices again in the U.S. by up to $5,000 per vehicle**  Tesla's ([TSLA.US](https://tsla.us/))$ website showed on Thursday that the price of its electric cars in the United States has been reduced once again. And just one month has passed since the last time Tesla cut prices in the United States. The price of both versions of the Model 3 was cut by $1,000, the price of the two existing Model Y models was cut by $2,000, and the Model S and Model X were each cut by $5,000. In addition, Tesla has officially launched a new, less expensive Model Y with AWD powertrain in the U.S., priced at $49,990.  **ExxonMobil reportedly in talks to buy shale oil giant Pioneer Natural Resources**  ExxonMobil ([XOM.US](https://xom.us/))$ has entered into preliminary informal discussions to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources ([PXD.US](https://pxd.us/))$, the top-ranked independent oil producer and shale oil production giant in the United States, media said Friday, April 7, citing sources familiar with the matter. Pioneer Natural Resources currently has a market capitalization of approximately $49 billion.  ***The key financial events and data for this week (4.10-4.14*** ***are as follows:)***  In terms of economic data, investors need to pay attention to China's March CPI data, the U.S. March CPI data and the U.S. March retail sales data, known as "scary data".  In terms of financial events, the recent ChatGPT concept, Shang Tang, will hold a technology exchange day on Monday to share its AI technology progress; in addition, the 2023 Ali Cloud Summit will be held on Tuesday.

U.S. stocks Q1 earnings season is back, BlackRock, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase will announce results on Friday, the market focus on banking executives on the size of bank deposits, asset liquidity and loan loss provisioning related remarks.  **According to the above, the short-term focus on large technology stocks, this aspect of the market is relatively weak in the case of a sustained breakthrough trend, indicating that the short-term large capital in the field, so the operation is the same as last week's recommendations, continue to do more at low, there is a Chinese stock can pay attention to the bottom of the stage is determined, you can pay attention to the low point of low absorption opportunities.**,;,; 2023-04-10 12:49:59]

[TSLA: Cybertruck‚Äôs About to Nuke Boomer Auto,;,; Alright degens I've been crunching some numbers that are gonna make you twitch. People say the Cybertruck is a joke, but I think those smooth-brains have a huge blind spot. Just back in March [Morgan Stanley shat on](https://insideevs.com/news/656606/morgan-stanley-cybertruck-low-volume-prediction/) the truck, predicting just 50k deliveries PER YEAR.  I'll keep it short but let's talk about it.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/67wh9l3twm7b1.png?width=1120&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73dc7d836f45a4065af39ab19791014beec5211f  The Cybertruck has 1.5 million reservations already, and Google Trends data suggests that it could go as mainstream as the Model Y. When Elon tweeted about the Cybertruck in April, the internet broke with searches for it. And guess where these searches came from? Truck-loving areas. Places where all the dudes drive F150s and Silverados. They're flirting.  We all know how boomers in the auto industry like Ford and Chevy milk profits from gas-guzzling trucks to fund their garbage EV projects. But what if Musk and his Cybertruck come in across middle America like a wrecking ball? Cash cow slaughtered. Margins decimated.  I smell blood, and I think you do too.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/grulj39uwm7b1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b59bb746c62ca30fbdc6bdce2460f0e7026fcd9  Remember back in 2014, when everyone laughed at the idea of EVs? The US Energy Information Administration predicted them to have a tiny market share by 2040. Well, EVs hit 5% of the US market share last year, and the projection has been increased each year. Now, they're saying it'll be like 14% by 2040. They're worse at predictions than JPow and the fed are about inflation.  Even with that lowball number, Tesla‚Äôs got a path for 70%+ global EV market share. That‚Äôs like 8 million cars per year, up from 1.3m last year.  Now, some pencil-pushers are saying trucks will make up 69% of all vehicles in the US by 2040, but EV trucks will only grab a measly 10% of that. Here's what I say to them: üñï  These analysts might be scared of forecasting exponential EV growth, but I think it's about damn time they woke up and smelled the electric engine fires. The Cybertruck will be a nightmare for traditional automakers.  So this might be a good time to bump up your TSLA exposure. This is not financial advice, but those Cybertruck numbers should blow whiny analysts‚Äô expectations out of the water.  tl;dr: Cybertruck is gonna go mainstream, disrupting traditional automakers and sending EV growth to the moon. Hold onto your seats, apes. Watch those Cybertrucks fly off the shelves and print tendies with me through 2024.  Position: Long $TSLA.

[I have a question about stock market fluctuations.,;,; So I started investing in stocks around two years ago, mostly as a way of learning some things about the market. I started with little money and traded mostly in ETFs. It was interesting for me to see how for example China‚Äôs lockdown problems and the following supply chain issues or the Ukraine war influenced my stock prices. Right now I would say that I have a better feeling for how this all works.   However, I have a question about some odd fluctuations. If I look at my stock ‚Äî 5 stocks and 6 ETFs at the moment ‚Äî I see them fluctuating somewhat randomly throughout the week. I‚Äôd say that this is to be expected. They tend to go up over time but from day to day they have some fluctuations because of people trading, news about a company, annual figures, etc. However, some days just look odd. Some days almost all of my stocks just drop by a couple points. They‚Äôd all be slowly rising for about a week and then suddenly they all dip. Today was such a day.   To show what I mean: - Infineon Technologies (-2.17%) - NXP semiconductors (-1.47%) - Philips (-1%) - S&amp;P Divident Aristocrats (-0.3%) - Vanguard All World (-0.3%) - Vanguard Developed World (-0.3%) - S&amp;P 500 (-0.3%) - Airbus (+0.3%) - XTrackers AI (+0.26%)  So is this just a random fluctuation like usually happens or do days like this have some other cause? I know it‚Äôs a minor loss, but the pattern intrigued me. I‚Äôd love to gain insight into this.,;,; 2024-01-25 12:28:26]

[What Am I Missing?,;,; Edit: People seem to have a TSLA fixation and think I want to buy it. That's not the case. I don't care what your opinion of TSLA is. I've done my analysis of all the stocks mentioned below according to the analysis mentioned below. Tell me where my analysis falls short and what other methods I should consider (that don't involve technical analysis).   Seeing some recent rave reviews about TSLA, ADBE, and FDX lately. Talking about the charging method Tesla uses becoming the standard in North America and being adopted by SAE, Adobe's investments in generative AI, and Fedex being able to pick up some slack if UPS workers go on strike, as well as some other investments and innovations they've been making.  But the problem is, I just don't see them valued at good prices.   FDX is trading at almost 2.5x book and 21x earnings  ADBE is trading at 15x book, almost 47x earnings, and 12x revenue per share  TSLA is trading at almost 17x book, almost 74x earnings, and over 9x revenue per share.  From a valuation standpoint (P/B, P/E, and P/S), those numbers are completely unjustifiable when considering buying.  So is there something I'm missing? Something I'm failing to consider? It seems like in the case of TSLA and ADBE their tech advancements could be a competitive advantage. Or are these types of stocks just wildly overhyped and overpriced? Because from a valuation perspective (P/B, P/E, and P/S) things like DINO, PBR, TSN, NTR, X, HMC, WFG, BIO, and BNTX look like great buys - why wouldn't I just buy those. They seem much more fairly priced, even cheap...  So what am I missing? What else do I need to consider in my analysis, if anything?,;,; 2023-06-29 03:55:36]

[Investment plan for about 85 000$ USD over the coming year,;,; So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years.  I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030.  However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.  I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.  The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)  Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco **S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&amp;P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)  So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?  Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :),;,; 2023-07-17 13:28:09]
[Thoughts?,;,; First-time investor from Europe (just turned 21), looking to invest long-term and add mainly to VUSA through dollar-cost averaging yearly. Any opinions welcome. I know Revolut is not a popular choice of brokerage but many services that are available in the USA are not available here and I already owned the app/wanted an easy-to-use interface.

[regulatory approval for Neuralink to test its chip in humans, sends valuation to $5bn,;,; Elon Musk's company, Neuralink, which is developing technology to implant chips in human brains, is now valued at around $5 billion.  This valuation increase is due to some investors purchasing stock and the recent U.S. regulatory approval for Neuralink to test its chip in humans.  The full breakdown will be going live tomorrow morning [right here](https://theoneread.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=eric), but all points are included below for Reddit discussion as well.  Despite this progress, experts warn it could take many more years before the technology is ready for commercial use. Additionally, Neuralink is facing challenges related to its treatment of animals during research and is currently under investigation by federal authorities.  After receiving approval for human trials, the company offered its shares privately to investors at an even higher valuation of $7 billion, although it's unclear whether any investors bought shares at this price.  **why is this important?**  1. **Potential Impact on Healthcare**: Neuralink's technology could potentially revolutionize healthcare by offering treatments for a range of conditions such as depression, autism, and paralysis. If successful, it could also open up possibilities like web-surfing or telepathy through the implanted chip, as Musk has suggested. 2. **Innovation and Investment**: The increased valuation of Neuralink demonstrates investor confidence in the potential of this groundbreaking technology, and it could spur further innovation and investment in the field of brain-computer interfaces and neurotechnology. 3. **Regulatory Hurdles**: The approval for human trials is a crucial step in Neuralink's development process. It signifies that the company has met certain safety standards and regulatory requirements. However, the investigations into Neuralink's handling of animal research highlight the complex ethical and regulatory challenges involved in such cutting-edge technology. 4. **Musk Factor**: Anything related to Elon Musk tends to draw significant attention due to his track record of successful ventures, such as Tesla and SpaceX. His involvement could influence public perception and investor sentiment around Neuralink. 5. **Risks and Skepticism**: Despite the progress, experts express skepticism about Neuralink's high valuation given its early-stage development and the many hurdles it still faces. This indicates a need for caution among potential investors and a reminder that success in this ambitious venture is not guaranteed.  **P.S.** If you like this kind of analysis, there's more in this [free newsletter](https://theoneread.beehiiv.com/subscribe?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=eric) that tracks the biggest issues and implications in the market.

[Why Ford Could Sit Nicely In Your Portfolio,;,;  On February 2, 2023, $F (Ford Motor Co) announced a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. This is in line with the company's previous quarterly dividend, and the forward yield is 4.19%. The dividend will be payable on March 1, 2023, to shareholders of record as of February 13, 2023, with an ex-dividend date of February 10, 2023.    In addition to the regular dividend, Ford also declared a supplemental dividend of $0.65 per share. The automaker attributed this to strong cash flow and the successful monetization of its stake in Rivian Automotive $RIVN (Rivian Automotive) which is nearly complete. This additional dividend is welcome news for shareholders and highlights the company's commitment to returning value to investors.    Compared to its peers, Ford's dividend yield is fairly attractive. This dividend is just one part of the company's broader strategy to improve its financial performance and reward shareholders. Ford has been working to streamline its operations, reduce costs, and invest in new technologies to remain competitive in a rapidly changing automotive landscape.    The dividend announcement comes at a time when the automotive industry is facing a number of challenges, including the ongoing semiconductor shortage and supply chain disruptions. Despite these headwinds, Ford has continued to deliver strong results, with solid revenue growth and improving margins. The successful monetization of its stake in Rivian is just one example of how the company is leveraging its assets to create value for shareholders.    In conclusion, Ford's announcement of a regular and supplemental dividend is a positive sign for investors. The company's commitment to returning value to shareholders, combined with its efforts to improve its financial performance, make it an attractive investment opportunity in the automotive sector.

[Anyone have experience with getting exposure in private companies via asset management companies?,;,; Hey lads! I‚Äôm sure everyone by now is pretty aware of the AI and robotics space as it‚Äôs literally all over the place right now. People like Elon Musk have been talking about it a lot recently and Tesla also just put out their newest iteration of their bots on LinkedIn which was pretty cool to see. I‚Äôve always been amazed at how robots are able to do tasks in the same capacity we do so seeing it come to fruition is pretty insane to me.  I always do my best to keep up with news in the space to see if there‚Äôs any cool advancements or new jobs that these robots are taking on. That being said I saw today that ‚ÄúUnited Drug‚Äù who is one of Ireland‚Äôs largest pharmaceutical distributors has just brought in a whole squad of autonomous robots..and when I say squad I mean 21 robots lmao. That‚Äôs almost enough for a soccer match lol. The company partnered with LocusBots to make this happen which I found pretty cool because I had heard about them working with DHL and UPS before. Apparently these robots are able to navigate autonomously through the warehouse and assist the human staff (thought I‚Äôd add the human part on just incase lol) with handling orders. It‚Äôs suppose to increase overall productivity of the warehouse, which I feel like is going to be the case when you add in robotics in any capacity to somewhere. I wonder if robots are eventually going to eliminate a whole bunch of jobs in the near future.. What yall think? I feel like i can easily see robots operating a warehouse.  After reading through the article I wanted to check out LocusBots a bunch more and invest in them. Cause if they are making big splashes like this in major companies around the world I want to be in on them. It was annoying to find out that they‚Äôre a private company lol  I did however come across Stack Capital while doing my search into investing into Locus. From what I gathered Stack Capital invests in equity, debt, and/or other securities of growth-to-late-stage private businesses. I seen that in their portfolio they had already invested $8m into LocusBots back in 2022 so this could potentially be a good way to indirectly invest in them right? From the looks of it they have a pretty solid management team with a whole bunch of experience so I‚Äôm not super worried about their judgement when it comes to portfolio management.  Does anyone have experience with getting exposure in private companies this way? I‚Äôve personally never done it so I‚Äôm not 100% sure on it. I really love the look of Locus so I would really love to get some insight into companies like Stack and if they‚Äôre a good shout or not.,;,; 2023-05-30 17:27:07]

[(3/8) Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,;,; #Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, March the 8th, 2023-  *****  # [Stock futures are flat following a selloff fueled by Powell‚Äôs comments: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/07/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)  ***** &gt; U.S. stock futures were little changed Wednesday, a day after a selloff spurred by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell‚Äôs comments indicating interest rates may need to go higher for longer. ***** &gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures ticked higher by 35 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures rose marginally. ***** &gt; The Dow closed nearly 575 points lower on Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 slid 1.53% to close below the key 4,000 threshold, and the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.25%. The sharp decline for stocks was accompanied by a spike in bond yields, with the rate on the 2-year Treasury surpassing 5% and touching the highest level since 2007. ***** &gt; The shakeup in markets came after Fed Chair Powell spoke before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. He cautioned lawmakers that the central bank‚Äôs terminal rate will likely be higher than previously anticipated due to stubbornly high economic data in recent weeks. ***** &gt; ‚Ä≥[Powell] is being very, very clear that if you look at what happened over the past year and a half, the call on inflation didn‚Äôt pan out,‚Äù Morgan Stanley‚Äôs global chief economist Seth Carpenter said on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell: Overtime.‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think now Powell is very much on board with the idea that he does not want to get caught flat-footed again, and so opening the door very wide for a 50 basis point hike was exactly what he did,‚Äù Carpenter added. ***** &gt; On Wednesday, investors will be closely watching Powell speak before the House Financial Services Committee. Separately, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin will also be speaking on the labor market Wednesday morning. January‚Äôs job openings and labor turnover data is due, as is the ADP jobs report for February.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/HsGVGMM.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Wst3IHQ.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/HcA8GOW.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/pieagEG.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/7qdD5RD.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/tdl0lVA.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$CRWD $SE $DKS $CIEN $JD $AZUL $ULTA $DOCU $MDB $BDSX $BJ $HPK $SOUN $NTNX $ADAP $DRIO $RIDE $TCOM $SQSP $CPB $FSTR $BNGO $AUTL $DOMO $SNCE $NINE $RNGR $DOLE $GPS $THO $PSFE $AVAV $CARA $GWRE $VFF $BBAR $ESTE $GOL $ASAN $ORCL $XXII $CASY $FERG $DAVE $WW $GEVO $PASG $FRWG*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Z3ONWGB.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$CPB $NINE $UNFI $GOL $VRDN $ABM $NVEI $MCG $MNTX $LTH $VERX $XERS $IMXI $REVG $COCO $KFY $VRA $LFST $BF.B $YST $CINT $NERV $VBNK*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/h0tRTXN.jpg)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QFpHu7V.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/VZCrw1w.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/MNR3uor.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/QGt9NXc.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/qUTw8it.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/bOcHNVM.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/cVs6DqW.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:  * HKD * SHIB.X * XRP.X * CRWD * RUM * WW * RIVN * OXY * TCNNF * VGX.X  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/08/stocks-making-the-biggest-premarket-moves-crwd-oxy-tsla.html)**)  *****  &gt; **CrowdStrike** ‚Äî Shares of the cybersecurity firm climbed more than 6% in premarket trading after a stronger-than-expected report for the fourth quarter.

[Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&amp;P 500 gains,;,; = just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing =  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023  [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9)  &amp;#x200B;  The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&amp;P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.  &amp;#x200B;  It‚Äôs an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inflation battle, noted FactSet‚Äôs Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 top performing days for the S&amp;P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday‚Äôs close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%.  &amp;#x200B;  Through Dec. 22, the S&amp;P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&amp;P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.  &amp;#x200B;  Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&amp;P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  That didn‚Äôt mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.  &amp;#x200B;  Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.  &amp;#x200B;  Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.  &amp;#x200B;  The strategy ‚Äúindicates the Fed‚Äôs measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,‚Äù Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&amp;P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks‚Äô bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group‚Äôs announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.  &amp;#x200B;  SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a ‚Äúmini‚Äù banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.  &amp;#x200B;  Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks ‚Äî Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%,  and Meta Platforms Inc.  META, 0.56%.  &amp;#x200B;  See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?  &amp;#x200B;  Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high:  &amp;#x200B;  The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs overall return, he wrote, with the company‚Äôs success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.,;,; 2023-12-27 15:52:27]

[(4/10) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,;,; # Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, April 10th, 2023-  *****  # [S&amp;P 500 futures decline to start the week as investors‚Äô recession fears grow: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html) ***** &gt; S&amp;P 500 futures declined on Monday, as investors looked ahead to key inflation data and the start of first-quarter earnings season. ***** &gt; Futures tied to the broad market S&amp;P 500 fell 0.18%, and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures was little changed. Nasdaq 100 futures shed 0.49%. ***** &gt; On Thursday, the major averages rose to end a holiday-shortened trading week. However, only the Dow notched a weekly gain of 0.6% while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posted weekly losses, ending lower by 0.1% and 1.1%, respectively. ***** &gt; The market was volatile as economic data showed signs of a weakening labor market. The March jobs report on Friday showed a resilient economy and moderate inflation, however, which pushed stock futures and Treasury yields higher. The New York Stock Exchange was closed for Good Friday. ***** &gt; Nonfarm payrolls grew by 236,000 for the month, about in line with the Dow Jones estimate of 238,000, the Labor Department reported. The unemployment fell to 3.5%, against expectations that it would hold from the previous month at 3.6%. ***** &gt; Investors are in for a busy week of economic data, including the latest consumer price index and producer price index data ‚Äì due out Wednesday and Thursday, respectively ‚Äì which will be key in determining if or when the Fed will pause or put an end to its rate hiking campaign. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúOur guess is the equity market needs economic Goldilocks, a bit of slowing to continue to cool inflation expectations, but not too much to spark ‚Äòhard landing‚Äô fears,‚Äù Raymond James‚Äô Tavis C. McCourt wrote in a Sunday note. ***** &gt; They‚Äôll also get the first batch of companies reporting first-quarter financial results. Tilray Brands kicks things off Monday. The major banks ‚Äì JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup ‚Äì will report on Friday.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/SEGLNbJ.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)  *****  #LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fo5yQPQ.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/oGtJCdb.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XEuYACg.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/geev0Gp.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$DAL $JPM $UNH $GBX $KMX $TLRY $C $WFC $ACI $IMBI $PGR $PNC $BLK $FAST $INFY $APOG $BYRN $RENT $OGI $WAFD $CGNT $LAKE $THTX $SPWH $UXIN $SKIL $NTIC $SBEV $LVMUY*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/LlMOBkG.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*N/A.*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Exopf5u.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/ojM0x2d.png)**)  *****  #FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/3Oj5wvD.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ccB4NYr.png)**)  *****  #FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/MV6TA8c.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/G5ZagLi.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:  * BUD * TSLA * GFAI * NVAX * PXD * TSM * MDU * AAPL * STWD * ASX  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/10/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-mu-pxd-tsla.html)**)  *****  &gt; **Micron Technology** ‚Äì Shares jumped more than 6% following news that Samsung Electronics plans to cut memory chip production near term.

S&amp;P 500 futures also climbed 0.9%, while Nasdaq-100 futures were up 0.3%. ***** &gt; Regional banks surged in early trading, led by First Republic. The beaten-down bank jumped 21.9%, a day after losing 47%. The SPDR Regional Banking ETF (KRE) gained 3%. Regionals got a boost after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday morning that the government is ready to provide further guarantees of deposits if the banking crisis worsens. ***** &gt; Wall Street is coming off a strong rally, with the Dow surging more than 380 points Monday, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.9%. The action came a day after a forced takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, which was engineered by the Swiss government. Investors also welcomed news that JPMorgan Chase could be advising embattled First Republic Bank on strategic alternatives. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúBank selling appears exhausted and it would take the emergence of fresh deposit problems at a new name to bring out incremental supply, although there‚Äôs very little interest to step in and buy the group, especially the regionals,‚Äù Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge, said in a note. ***** &gt; Investors now expect a slower pace of tightening from the Federal Reserve in light of the banking crisis. Traders now are pricing in a 83% chance of a quarter-point rate hike when the Fed wraps its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, according to CME Group‚Äôs FedWatch tool. The probability of a pause is at 16.6%. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúRisks of contagion are rising and could push the Fed to pause the current rate hiking cycle, although this is not our base case,‚Äù said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. ‚ÄúThe Fed will likely signal they are near the end of their rate hiking campaign as recession risks increase and inflation pressures decrease.‚Äù  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/zigPsfW.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WuDZYIS.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/o4kZQFT.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/73vXuqs.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/kkUKWxH.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$PDD $ARRY $NKE $FL $GME $CSIQ $TME $CHWY $GIS $ACN $NIU $RVLP $WOOF $DRI $DOYU $ONON $ADMA $FDS $BZ $BRAG $AIR $KBH $DOOO $GAMB $CMC $EXPR $OLLI $HQY $BITF $ACDC $NVGS $HRTX $HUYA $AEVA $CTRN $WGO $LLAP $OXSQ $SMTI $XFOR $PHUN $SPPI $BZUN $EXAI $WVE $PHR $HYPR $KULR $XGN $SCVL*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/JxG6hIn.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$CSIQ $TME $ONON $BRAG $SMTI $XGN $CTRN $BITF $HUYA $ACDC $OXSG $LLAP $LTRN $XFOR $LMDX $INKT $DFLI*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/1Kr44Qi.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ao5glH6.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/kUQisGv.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5PQzaqI.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/3obokzF.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/vgSfydY.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/nqwy9QE.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/upDXKH8.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:  * FRC * DWAC * ALT * JPM * CSIQ * ONON * PLUG * DJIA * VIGL * NASDAQ  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/21/stocks-making-the-biggest-premarket-moves-.html)**)  *****  &gt; **Tesla** ‚Äî The electric vehicle maker rose 2% after Moody‚Äôs assigned it a Baa3 rating and removed its junk-rated credit.

Chevron is set to give the index a boost as it gained 4.5% in pre-market trading on the spike in oil prices. ***** &gt; The output cut from OPEC+, which is slashing 1.16 million barrels per day, sent oil prices soaring. West Texas Intermediate crude was 6.6% higher, while international benchmark Brent crude climbed 6%. ***** &gt; Traders are shedding optimism from recent market strength with the prospect of higher oil prices adding to fears of higher inflation and a looming recession. ***** &gt; The Energy Select Sector SPDR fund (XLE), which tracks the S&amp;P 500 energy sector, also popped more than 3% in the premarket. Marathon Oil and Halliburton were the fund‚Äôs best performers, rising more than 6% each. ***** &gt; All three major averages were positive in the first quarter, despite turmoil in the banking sector highlighted by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March. The Nasdaq Composite led the way in the quarter with a gain of 16.8% while the S&amp;P 500 rose 7% in the first three months of the year for its second-straight positive quarter. The Dow industrials lagged but still managed to grind out an advance of 0.4%. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúFor now at least, tech is seen as a safe haven of all things, immune to the news in banking. The S&amp;P 500, in turn, seems held together by its own heavy weighting in tech, names like Microsoft, Apple and the like,‚Äù Wellington Shields technical analyst Frank Gretz said in a note to clients. ***** &gt; The first week of the new quarter is a shortened one for Wall Street, as trading will be closed for Good Friday. However, there will be several key pieces of economic data for investors, including job openings data on Tuesday, ADP private payrolls report on Wednesday and the closely watched monthly jobs report on Friday.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/11eXFpo.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)  *****  #LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GEv6A54.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/JpIs9Gp.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/0v7CXuP.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/DPM9cgs.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$SAIC $CAG $LW $AYI $STZ $FLGC $MSM $OCX $DLO $RPM $LEVI $SMPL $LNN $APLD $SCHN $EGY $IONM $KRUS $GNLN $SGH $RELL $WDFC $FRLN $SNAX $ZENV $CLIR $RGP $SLP $SDRL $NG*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5Y8HITW.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$EAST $SAIC $WLMS $FLGC $FSI $OCX $VTSI $IONM $MIRO $ELBM $TIVC*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/60PjWGG.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/r4mgY1P.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**) (NONE.)  *****  #FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES!](https://i.imgur.com/KLDbdZx.png)**)  *****  #FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/QpUPAM6.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/XEOeE5N.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2kuKJ0T.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:  * TSLA * SOFI * AI * OXY * WWE * BUD * GFAI * CLF * ANVS * CRSP  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/03/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-mro-m-wwe-and-more.html)**)  *****  &gt; **Energy stocks** ‚Äî Energy stocks rose broadly Monday after OPEC surprised the market by announcing a production cut.

[Looking into Tom Lee's world,;,; ,;,; 2023-05-22 18:41:38]
[Shopify ($SHOP) delivers impressive earnings, enticing investors to consider buying the stock.,;,;    ## Shopify's Q1 earnings call contained a major surprise.  The e-commerce landscape is dominated by behemoths like **Amazon** and **Walmart**. However, there are a number of rising players that have made inroads. One of them is **Shopify** **(****SHOP** **0.15%)**. If you have ever clicked on an advertisement on Facebook or Instagram and subsequently made a purchase, chances are you've checked out using Shopify.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, Shopify boomed in popularity. It's no secret that the pandemic was a catalyst for online shopping and the creation of side hustles (monetizing a hobby). During this period, Shopify's offering was in high demand, and subsequently, the financial profile of the company seemingly changed overnight.  It should be noted that Shopify's infrastructure is designed for businesses of all sizes, and not just small or medium businesses (SMBs). For example, Tesla uses Shopify as does PepsiCo, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and Nestle.  Furthermore, large consulting firms like Deloitte and enterprises such as **IBM** have strategic agreements with the e-commerce company as systems-integrated partners.  Like many other businesses, Shopify's operating results have started to normalize in a post-pandemic world and shares are up roughly 70% this year as of the time of this article, although they still are down about 65% from all-time highs in November 2021. Let's dig into the company's first-quarter results and assess if it's trading at a reasonable valuation and deserves a look for your portfolio.     ## Shopify's Q1 at a Glance  During Shopify's fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call, management offered the following outlook for the first quarter of 2023:  * Revenue growth in the high-teen percentages year over year; * Gross margins to be slightly higher quarter over quarter.  Per the company's Q1 earnings release, Shopify's revenue grew by 25% (and 27% on a constant-currency basis) to $1.5 billion. And its gross margin was 47.5%, up from 46% in Q4.So it's safe to say that Shopify exceeded its own forecast.  Another metric to analyse is the company's operating expenses. For the quarter, Shopify's operating expenses totalled $910 million, up 24% year over year. That increase was mainly driven by salaries and wages, including those of the company's Deliver employees, a business that Shopify is now selling just a year after buying it.  While Shopify blew away its revenue forecast, investors should be keenly aware that the company's combined annual growth for the cost of goods sold and operating expenses outweighed its revenue growth. For this reason, Shopify reported an operating loss of $193 million, nearly double its operating loss in Q1 2022. Yet despite these operating losses, Shopify reported a net income of $68 million, or $0.05 in earnings per share (EPS).¬†   By contrast, Shopify reported a net loss of $1.5 billion ($1.17 EPS) for Q1 2022. This was due to a $1.6 billion net unrealized loss on equity and other investments.  Shopify owns stakes in other companies, and when these stocks experience volatility in either direction, it must factor those unrealized gains or losses relative to the cost basis for each investment into its bottom line. It should be noted that in Q1 2023, Shopify booked a net unrealized gain of $269 million, more than enough to overcome the operating loss. ¬†  Overall, these financial results look like a mixed bag to me. I am quite impressed by the revenue growth. However, Q1 clearly illustrated that the Deliver integration, and its associated costs, were a drag on the core business. After a year of rising costs and slow integration efforts, it's no wonder Shopify decided to pull the plug and divest these logistics assets to Flex port. While Shopify is also undergoing cost reductions in the form of layoffs, I question if a consistent path to profitability is viable.     ## Didn't see this coming  Although Shopify beat Wall Street's expectations, I think the *real* cause of its post-earnings stock surge was the surprise announcement that the company is selling its logistics assets to Flexport, a leader in that niche.  Remember, it was only last May that Shopify acquired the logistics and fulfillment company Deliverr. The thesis behind the deal was to layer Deliverr's merchant solutions on top of Shopify's fulfillment network (SFN) infrastructure. But over the last year, management has been updating investors about its integration efforts. Namely, Shopify's management made it clear that the extra costs associated with building out SFN will have a *dilutive* impact on the company's margin profile.¬†  While it may be uncomfortable to admit, Shopify's Q1 results show that it has overhead bloat, driven mainly by added headcount from Deliverr. The divestiture helps Shopify cut labor other non-core operating expenses related to its logistics business.¬†     ## Is the stock a buy?  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ejok5t214q0b1.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07eb3d2aa3cc50571a3de7cb8c4eb82190d7c22e     In my opinion, there is more than meets the eye here. When it comes to logistics, Amazon is a juggernaut and it took decades to get there. Plain and simple, Shopify does not have the financial flexibility or the technical know-how to compete. On the surface, selling the logistics assets seems like a smart and responsible move for Shopify.¬†  After the earnings call, analysts at several Wall Street institutions, among them **Goldman Sachs**, **Citigroup**, **Morgan Stanley**, and Piper Sandler, revised their price targets for Shopify.  Citigroup is the most bullish with a price estimate of $65 per share, implying roughly 8% upside from a recent price of about $60. By contrast, Piper Sandler modeled an intrinsic value of $50 per share or 17% downside. Goldman and Morgan Stanley have price estimates of $59 and $54 per share, respectively. The common theme among the banks is that all have neutral or neutral-equivalent ratings.  Shopify is not yet consistently profitable, which makes traditional valuation metrics such as price-to-earnings or the price/earnings-to-growth ratio less useful. One metric that can help is price-to-sales (P/S). Shopify is currently trading at 13 times its trailing-12-month revenue. P/S ratios vary by industry. But a general rule of thumb is to compare P/S ratios among competitors in the same industry. Given that comparable companies such as Amazon and Walmart are much larger, mature businesses, it's not necessarily fair to judge Shopify's P/S ratio because it's still a growth company, which as a group tends to have high ratios.¬†¬†  I personally do not like stocks when momentum is pushing them up. As a long-term investor, I am not looking to buy on perceived good news and sell on an upswing to book a quick gain. The most prudent action for investors is likely to assess Q2 earnings and digest how the Flexport deal is going. While Shopify has built a credible operation, the company faces an uphill battle, particularly with Amazon. There is definitely money to be made in Shopify stock, but it's volatility and underlying business fundamentals are enough for me to look elsewhere, and based on the available metrics it doesn't seem to be trading at a reasonable level.,;,; 2023-05-19 05:36:43]

Silvergate Capital, meanwhile, shares plunged more than 30%, after the company delayed its 10-K annual report. ***** &gt; Tesla shares, popular with retail investors, lost 5% after the company failed to unveil details of any next-generation vehicles during its much-anticipated investor day Wednesday. The decline put pressure on S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures. ***** &gt; Rates, meanwhile, pressed higher, with the benchmark 10-year note yield trading above 4%. The 2-year note yield reached levels not seen in more than a decade. ***** &gt; Wall Street is coming off a mixed session, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite falling Wednesday, while the Dow posted a small gain. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq are on pace for their second consecutive losing week for the first time since December. The Dow, meanwhile, is on track for its fifth consecutive negative week, a first since May 2022. ***** &gt; The rise in bond yields and concerns of a potentially larger-than-expected hike from the Federal Reserve have fueled investor concern in recent days, putting a dent in the early 2023 rally. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúYou have a situation where if rates stay high, multiples need to come in, and it likely leads to a further downfall down the line in the economy because there is a lag effect to these rate hikes,‚Äù Cantor Fitzgerald‚Äôs Eric Johnston said on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell: Overtime‚Äù on Wednesday. ‚ÄúAnd then once the economy falls, then earnings would have a fairly long way to go to the downside.‚Äù ***** &gt; On the economic front, investors await jobless claims, and unit labor costs and productivity data.

S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 hovered around the flatline. ***** &gt; Traders are coming off a positive week for the major averages. The Dow industrials added 1.75% last week, ending a four-week losing streak. The S&amp;P 500 advanced 1.90%, while the Nasdaq capped the week with a 2.58% pop. ***** &gt; Those gains come even as the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose above the psychological 4% level at various points last week. An upward move in the 10-year yield raises borrowing costs for consumers and could signal a drop in investor confidence. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre afraid of a recession, go get the 10-year Treasury,‚Äù Sri-Kumar Global‚Äôs Sri Kumar told CNBC on Friday. ‚ÄúEquities are a losing proposition today, and until you see the valuations come down significantly, just don‚Äôt trust [Friday‚Äôs] rally.‚Äù ***** &gt; Important catalysts this week include congressional testimony Tuesday and Wednesday from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who will guide investors and lawmakers on how the central bank is thinking about inflation and its rate-hiking campaign going forward. ***** &gt; Traders are also anticipating the February jobs report on Friday, which follows January‚Äôs blockbuster report that showed the economy added 517,000 payrolls. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting 225,000 jobs added last month. ***** &gt; On Monday, the latest factory orders data will also be released after the bell. Economists are expecting a decline of 1.8% in January, according to consensus estimates from Dow Jones. That‚Äôs compared to a 1.8% gain in the prior reading.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/Ug9cTQ6.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)  *****  #LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/BCq5iVd.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/bJ275Hp.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/7qdD5RD.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/tdl0lVA.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$CRWD $SE $DKS $CIEN $JD $AZUL $ULTA $DOCU $MDB $BDSX $BJ $HPK $SOUN $NTNX $ADAP $DRIO $RIDE $TCOM $SQSP $CPB $FSTR $BNGO $AUTL $DOMO $SNCE $NINE $RNGR $DOLE $GPS $THO $PSFE $AVAV $CARA $GWRE $VFF $BBAR $ESTE $GOL $ASAN $ORCL $XXII $CASY $FERG $DAVE $WW $GEVO $PASG $FRWG*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Z3ONWGB.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$CIEN $BDSX $ADAP $FSTR $RIDE $SNCE $CECO $PASG $QTRX*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/kVI3rV2.jpg)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/UA2TAKu.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/BVCCP41.png)**)  *****  #FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zqLCvR7.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/2w529Hy.png)**)   *****  #FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/QeSoaZW.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/U7X9Ju3.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/PIV6t5H.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ARWdeXq.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:  * BOIL * KALA * BBIO * ESPR * MO * AAPL * KOLD * CTIC * CIEN * AMBI  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/06/stocks-making-big-premarket-moves-ferrari-apple-kb-home-and-more.html)**)  *****  &gt; **Ferrari** ‚Äî Shares of the luxury automaker rose less than 1% early Monday after Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas named it a top pick, replacing Tesla.

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023,;,; Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023.  # **Stocks close higher Friday as investors try to shake off latest bank fears: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/stock-futures-are-up-slightly-as-investors-weigh-bank-troubles-fed-decision.html)** ***** &gt; Stocks rose Friday, reversing their earlier session declines as Deutsche Bank shares pared back some losses. ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 132.28 points, or 0.41%, closing at 32,238.15. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.57%, while Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.3%. The major indexes all had a winning week, with the Dow gaining 0.4% week-to-date as of Friday afternoon, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq gained 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively. ***** &gt; Deutsche Bank‚Äôs U.S.-listed shares slid 3.11% Friday, rebounding from a 7% drop earlier in the trading session. A selloff of shares was triggered after the the German lender‚Äôs credit default swaps jumped, but without an apparent catalyst. The move appeared to raise concerns once again over the health of the European banking industry. Earlier this month, Swiss regulators forced a UBS acquisition of rival Credit Suisse. Deutsche Bank shares traded off their worst levels of the session, which caused major U.S. indexes to also cut their losses. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think that the market overall is neither frightened nor optimistic ‚Äî it‚Äôs simply confused,‚Äù said George Ball, president at Sanders Morris Harris. ‚ÄúThe price action for the last month-and-a-half, including today, is a jumble without any direction or conviction.‚Äù ***** &gt; Ball added that Deutsche Bank is ‚Äúvery sound financially.‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIt could be crippled if there‚Äôs a big loss of confidence and there‚Äôs a run on the bank. There is, however, no fundamental reason why that should occur, other than nervousness.‚Äù ***** &gt; European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde tried to ease concerns, saying euro zone banks are resilient with strong capital and liquidity positions. Lagarde said the ECB could provide liquidity if needed. ***** &gt; Investors continued to assess the Fed‚Äôs latest policy move announced this week. The central bank hiked rates by a quarter-point. However, it also hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be ending soon. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that credit conditions have tightened, which could put pressure on the economy. ***** &gt; On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said regulators are prepared to take more action if needed to stabilize U.S. banks.

For major US index ETFs, the S&amp;P Midcap 400 (IJH) is up the most having slightly more than doubled while the S&amp;P Smallcap 600 (IJR) is not far behind having rallied 95.9%. Value has generally outperformed growth, especially for mid and small-caps although that has shifted somewhat this year. For example, while its gains have been more middling since the COVID crash, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has been the strongest area of the equity market in 2023 thanks to the strength of sectors like Tech (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC). Although those sectors have posted strong gains this year, they have been the weakest over the past three years while Energy (XLE) far and away has been the strongest asset class. Paired with the strength of energy stocks has been solid runs in commodities (DBC)more broadly with the notable exception being Natural Gas (UNG) which has lost over 40%. Bond ETFs are similarly sitting on losses since the COVID Crash lows. As for international markets, Mexico (EWW) and India (PIN) have outpaced the rest of the world although Emerging Markets (EEM) as a whole have not been particularly strong; likely being dragged on by the weaker performance of China (ASHR) which holds a large weight on EEM.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low.png))**  &gt; Taking a look at current S&amp;P 500 members, nearly half of the index has more than doubled over the past three years. As for the absolute best performers, Energy stocks dominate the list with four of the top five best-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks coming from that sector. Targa Resources (TRGP) has been the absolute best performer with a nearly 900% total return. Other notables include a couple of heavy weight stocks: Tesla (TSLA) and NVIDIA (NVDA) with gains of 563.9% and 412.9%, respectively.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low-2.png))**  &gt; On the other end of the spectrum, there are currently 25 stocks that have posted a negative return since the COVID Crash low. The worst has been First Republic Bank (FRC) which has been more of a recent development. Whereas today the stock has posted an 83.1% loss, at the start of this month it would have been a 65% gain. Another standout on the list of worst performers has been Amazon (AMZN). Most other mega caps have more than doubled since the March 2020 S&amp;P 500 low, however, the e-commerce giant has hardly offered a positive return.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # Sector Performance Experiences a Historical Divergence  &gt; The first quarter of 2023 is coming to a close next week, and checking in on year to date performance, there has been a big divergence between the winners and losers. Although the S&amp;P 500 is up 2.84% on the year as of yesterday's close, only three of the eleven sectors are higher. Not only are those three sectors up on the year, but they have posted impressive double digit gains only three months into the year. Of those three, Consumer Discretionary has posted the smallest gain of 10% whereas Technology and Communication Services have risen 17.2% and 18.1%, respectively. The fact that these sectors are home to the main mega cap stocks -- like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have been on an impressive run of late -- helps to explain how the market cap weighted S&amp;P 500 is up on the year without much in the way of healthy breadth on a sector level.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-1a.png))**  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-1.png))**  &gt; One thing that is particularly remarkable about this year's sector performance is just how rare it is for a sector to be up 10%+ (let alone 3) while all other sectors are lower. And that is for any point of the year let alone in the first quarter. As we mentioned in yesterday's Sector Snapshot and show in the charts below, going back to 1990, there have only been two other periods in which a sector has risen at least 10% YTD while all other sectors were lower YTD. The first of those was in May 2009. In a similar instance to now, Consumer Discretionary, Tech, and Materials were the three sectors with double digit gains back then. With those sectors up solidly, the S&amp;P 500 was little changed on the year with a less than 1% gain. As you can see below, though, by the end of 2009, every sector had pushed into positive territory as the new bull market coming out of the global financial crisis was well underway.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-2.png))**  &gt; The next occurrence was much more recent: 2022. Obviously, it was a tough year for equities except for the Energy sector which had a banner year. Throughout most of the year, the sector traded up by well over 20% year to date even while the rest of the equity market was battered.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # The Fed Expects Banking Stress to Substitute for Rate Hikes  &gt; The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 0.25% at their March meeting, bringing it to the 4.75-5.0% range. This is the ninth-straight rate increase and brings rates to their highest level since 2007. However, the most aggressive tightening cycle since the early 1980s, which saw them lift rates all the way from near zero to almost 5%, is near its end.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-target-rate-601x800.png))**  &gt; Up until early February, Fed officials expected to raise rates to a maximum of about 5.1% and hold it there for a while. However, since that time, we‚Äôve gotten a slew of strong economic data, including elevated inflation numbers. This pushed fed officials to give ‚Äúguidance‚Äù that they expected to raise rates by more than they estimated back in December.  &gt; Market expectations for policy also moved in conjunction. Prior to February, markets expected the Fed to raise rates to 5% by June, and subsequently lower them by about 0.5% by the end of the year. But strong incoming data and Fed guidance pushed expectations higher, with the terminal rate moving up to 5.6% and no cuts in 2023.  &gt; # The Silicon Valley Bank crisis changed everything &gt; The bank crisis that erupted over the last couple of weeks resulted in a significant shift, both in expectations for policy and now the Fed as well. See here for our complete rundown on SVB and the ensuing crisis.  &gt; Market expectations for Fed policy rates immediately moved lower. Markets expected the stress in banks to translate to tighter credit conditions, which in turn would lead to slower economic growth and lower inflation.  &gt; This was nicely articulated by Professor Jeremey Siegel, one of the foremost commentators on financial markets and fed policy, in our latest episode of the Facts vs Feelings podcast, Prof. Siegel said that tighter credit conditions, as lending standards become more strict, are de facto rate hikes.  &gt; Fed Chair Powell more or less said exactly the same thing after the Fed‚Äôs March meeting. The 0.25% increase was an attempt to thread the needle between financial stability and fighting inflation. Fed officials also forecast the fed funds rate to hit a maximum of 5.1%, unchanged from their December estimate. This is a marked shift from what was expected just a few weeks ago, with Powell explicitly saying that tighter credit conditions ‚Äúsubstitute‚Äù for rate hikes.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-rate-expectations-600x800.png))**  &gt; # There‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty ahead &gt; While the recent bank stresses are expected to tighten credit conditions and thereby impact economic growth and inflation, there are a couple of open questions:  &gt; * How big will the impact be?  &gt; * How long will the impact last?  &gt; These are unknown currently. Which means future policy is also unknown.  &gt; Fed officials expect to take rates to 5.1%, i.e., one more rate increase. And then expect to hold it there through the end of the year. In short, they don‚Äôt expect rate cuts this year.  &gt; Yet investors expect no more rate increases and about 0.6% of rate cuts in the second half of 2023. Markets expect the policy rate in June to be at 4.8%, while expectations for December are at 4.2%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-implied-policy-rate-differential-600x800.png))**  &gt; There‚Äôs clearly a huge gulf between what the Fed expects versus what investors expect. This will have to reconcile in one of two ways:  &gt; * Market expectations move higher ‚Äì if economic/inflation data remain strong and credit conditions don‚Äôt look to be tightening significantly.  &gt; * Fed expectations move lower ‚Äì if the banking sector comes under renewed stress, credit conditions could tighten significantly and eventually lead to weaker data.  &gt; Things are obviously not going to go in either direction in a straight line. It‚Äôs going to be a bumpy ride as new data points come in, not to mention news/rumors of renewed problems in the banking sector.  *****  &gt; # Seasonality Keeps Claims Below 200K?  &gt; Initial jobless claims remained healthy this week with another sub-200K print. Claims fell modestly to 191K from last week's unrevised reading of 192K. That small decline exceeded expectations of claims rising up to 197K. Given claims continue to impress, the seasonally adjusted number has come in below 200K for 9 of the last 10 weeks. By that measure, it has been the strongest stretch for claims since last April when there were 10 weeks in a row of sub-200K prints. Prior to that, from 2018 through 2020 the late March and early April period similarly saw consistent readings under 200K meaning that some of the strength in the adjusted number could be on account of residual seasonality.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-1.png))**  &gt; In fact, this point of the year has some of the weeks in which claims have the most consistently historically fallen week over week. Taking a historical median of claims throughout the year, claims tend to round out a short-term bottom in the spring before an early summer bump. In other words, seasonal strength will begin to wane in the coming months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-2.png))**  &gt; While initial claims improved, continuing claims worsened rising to 1.694 million from 1.68 million the previous week. Albeit higher, that remains below the 2023 high of 1.715 million set at the end of February.  *****  &gt; # A Fed Day Like Most Others  &gt; Yesterday's Fed decision and comments from Fed Chair Powell gave markets plenty to chew on. As we discussed in last night's Closer and today's Morning Lineup, there have been a number of conflicting statements from officials and confusing reactions in various assets over the past 24 hours. In spite of all that uncertainty, the S&amp;P 500's path yesterday pretty much followed the usual script. In the charts below we show the S&amp;P's average intraday pattern across all Fed days since Powell has been chair (first chart) and the intraday chart of the S&amp;P yesterday (second chart). As shown, the market's pattern yesterday, especially after the 2 PM ET rate decision and the 2:30 PM press conference, closely resembled the average path that the market has followed across all Powell Fed Days since 2018.  &gt; The S&amp;P saw a modest bounce after the 2 PM Fed decision and then a further rally right after Powell's presser began at 2:30 PM. That initial post-presser spike proved to be a pump-fake, as markets ultimately sold off hard with a near 2% decline from 2:30 PM to the 4 PM close.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-1a.png))**  &gt; So what typically happens in the week after Fed days? Since 1994 when the Fed began announcing policy decisions on the same day as its meeting, the S&amp;P has averaged a decline of 10 basis points over the next week. During the current tightening cycle that began about a year ago, market performance in the week after Fed days has been even worse with the S&amp;P averaging a decline of 0.99%. However, when the S&amp;P has been down over 1% on Fed days (like yesterday), performance over the next week has been positive with an average gain of 0.64%. As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-3.png))**  *****   &gt; # What Now? An Update on Recent Bank Stress.  &gt; It‚Äôs been less than 2 weeks since Silicon Valley Bank‚Äôs stunning 48-hour collapse, and a few more banks have been caught in the fray. New York regulators closed the doors on Signature Bank on Sunday, March 12. A week later, US banks injected $30 billion into First Republic Bank to keep it afloat, and UBS acquired rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse in a government-brokered deal. In the midst of the chaos, your Carson Investment Research team was there for you with client-facing content, professional advice, and investment solutions. In fact, we think this event presents an opportunity to invest in the more stable large-cap financial companies and recently upgraded the sector to overweight in our House Views Advice.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mar22_1-1600x927.png))**  &gt; # Why is this happening? &gt; The rapid hike in interest rates caused an asset and liability mismatch for banks. Due to many years of low-interest rates, banks invested assets in interest-earning loans and bonds that would be repaid over the next five-plus years, which at the time was a logical way to earn a higher yield. Regulators considered government bonds to be among the safest ways a bank could invest its capital. As interest rates rose, bond values dropped. Interest rates rose at the fastest pace in history, and the safe assets that banks invested in lost value to the tune of more than $620 billion in unrealized losses as of the end of last year. This decline in value left weaker banks underwater and, when coupled with depositors pulling money out, caused them to collapse or seek costly capital raises.  &gt; # Why this matters to investors? &gt; The weakness in the banking sector will likely lead to tighter lending standards, potentially slowing economic growth. The reason we‚Äôre in this mess, to begin with, is that the Fed hiked interest rates to slow the economy because inflation was rising too quickly. Perhaps the 16% drop in oil prices over the past two weeks reflected this slower growth and bodes well for continued falling inflation. Thus, the Fed is closer to achieving its goal.  &gt; Maybe it‚Äôs an overreaction as ‚Äúbanking crisis‚Äù headlines stir painful memories of 2008. Either way, an environment with slower growth and lower inflation isn‚Äôt a bad time to invest. Bonds and stocks could both perform well, especially stocks of companies with the ability to grow earnings. We also reiterate our House Views Advice overweight on the large-cap Financials sector. The largest US banks are well-capitalized and are gaining market share from the smaller regional banks. We believe this calamity provides an opportunity for stronger banks and investors to capitalize on.  *****  &gt; # FANG+ Flying  &gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup, sector performance has heavily favored areas like Tech, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services in recent weeks. Playing into that sector level performance has been the strength of the mega-caps. The NYSE FANG+ index tracks ten of the largest and most highly traded Tech and Tech-adjacent names. In the past several days, that cohort of stocks is breaking out to the highest level since last April whereas the S&amp;P 500 still needs to rally 4% to reach its February high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-1.png))**  &gt; Although FANG+ stocks have been strong recently, that follows more than a full year of underperformance. As shown below, relative to the S&amp;P 500, mega-cap Tech consistently underperformed from February 2021 through this past fall. In the past few days, the massive outperformance has resulted in a breakout of the downtrend for the ratio of FANG+ to the S&amp;P 500.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-2.png))**  &gt; More impressive is how rapid of a move it has been for that ratio to break out. Below, we show the 2-month percent change in the ratio above. As of the high at yesterday's close, the ratio had risen 22.5% over the prior two months. That comes up just short of the record (22.6%) leading up to the pre-COVID high in February 2020. In other words, mega-cap Tech has experienced near-record outperformance relative to the broader market. However, we would note that this is in the wake of last year when the group had seen some of its worst two-month underperformance on record with the worst readings being in March, May, and November.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # March Seasonality Prevails, Banking Fiasco Be Damned  &gt; It‚Äôs encouraging typical March seasonal patterns have overcome recent bank failures, recession talk and fearmongering. The early March pullback was steeper than normal, but the usual mid-month rebound appears to be materializing.  &gt; Last week‚Äôs gains could be an indication we have seen the worst of the banking fallout and the end of the pullback. Triple Witching Weeks have tended to be down in flat periods and dramatically so during bear markets. Positive March Triple Witching weeks in 2003 and 2009 confirmed the market was back in rally mode.  &gt; The week after March Triple Witching is notoriously nasty. S&amp;P is down 27 of the last 40 year ‚Äì and frequently down sharply. Positive or flat action this week would be constructive.  &gt; In the old days March used to come in like a bull and out like a bear. Nowadays March has evolved into an inflection point where short-term trends often change course. The market is clearly at an important juncture and it‚Äôs a good time to remember Warren Buffet‚Äôs wise words to ‚ÄúBe greedy when others are fearful.‚Äù  &gt; Bank failures are never a good thing, but the swift actions of regulators likely prevented further damage to the industry. At the least, the banks are likely to be under even greater scrutiny going forward. In the near-term we expect more volatile trading. Further out we expect the market, and the economy will recover like they both have historically done.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5fe6f3377343f819ff93c97e8aeb8ffc/1258a39f06bd18c7-63/s500x750/303b38d927e1a424f5dc254dd086678978f2cc12.jpg))**  *****  &gt; # Nasdaq Leaves the S&amp;P in the Dust  &gt; Looking at the major US index ETF screen of our Trend Analyzer shows just how disconnected the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has become from other major index ETFs recently. As shown below, as of Friday's close, QQQ actually finished in overbought territory (over 1 standard above its 50-DMA) whereas many other major index ETFs were oversold, some of those to an extreme degree. On a year to date basis, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has rallied more than 14% compared to low single digit gains or losses for the rest of the pack.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/usindexqqq.png))**  &gt; Historically, the major indices, namely the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, tend to trade at similar overbought and oversold levels. In the chart below we show the Nasdaq 100 and S&amp;P 500's distance from their 50-DMAs (expressed in standard deviations) over the past five years. As shown, typically the two large cap indices have seen similar albeit not identical readings. That is until the past few weeks in which the two have diverged more significantly.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**  &gt; On Friday there was more than 2 standard deviations between the Nasdaq's overbought 50-DMA spread and the S&amp;P 500's oversold spread. As shown in the chart below, that surpassed recent highs in the spread like the spring of 2020 to set the highest reading since October 2016.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**  &gt; Going back to 1985, the spread between the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 50-DMA spreads diverging to such a degree is not without precedent, but it is also not exactly common. Friday marked the 16th time that spread eclipsed 2 standard deviations for the first time in at least 3 months. Relative to those prior instances, the current overbought and oversold readings in both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are relatively middling. However, only the instance in early 2000 similarly saw the Nasdaq technically overbought (trading at least a standard deviation above its 50-DMA) while the S&amp;P 500 was simultaneously oversold (at least one standard deviation below its 50-DMA).  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 24th, 2023**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JnEIcSYZEM))**  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3/26/23**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; (*$CCL $BNTX $LULU $MU $IZEA $SKLZ $WBA $HTHT $FUTU $LOVE $RH $PAYX $IHS $GOEV $CALM $PLAY $RUM $CTAS $CNM $MKC $BB $EVGO $VERO $AUGX $RGF $GMDA $SNX $RAIL $AEHR $PVH $SRT $UGRO $AADI $PRGS $DNMR $NEOG $CONN $IMBI $SOL $LOV $GROY $EE $ABOS $CNXC $UNF $AMPS $JEF $ESLT $CURI $DARE*)  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/mconM20.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/B9lJ6yg.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/kQxLMVP.png))**  *****  &gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).  &gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))  *****  # DISCUSS!
