[Jeff Bezos coming in hot with the insider buy on $Amzn. One whole ass share,;,; ,;,; 2023-05-27 19:52:29]
[Your lotto play for AMZN's earnings tonight,;,; So yesterday I told everyone to buy [META calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/) before earnings and it was a straight banger with the stock up 15% after earnings. The day before? [MSFT earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/), posted it before market close. Those who followed either times made big money! What's today's post? Let's take a look at Amazon (AMZN) which is set to release its earnings report today after the closing bell. Can we do it again? Let's see. We're all eagerly waiting to see the tech giant's financial performance for the first quarter of 2023. With a gain of 23% year to date, way above the 7% rise in the S&amp;P 500 index, Amazon has been one of the better-performing names within the tech sector. We want to know if daddy Bezos can maintain his strong momentum.  I expect the company to top the consensus estimates of earnings and revenues. Amazon outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 9% to $149.2 billion. It was due to a 13% rise in North America revenues and a 20% improvement in the Amazon web services segment. That said, the positive impact was partially offset by an 8% drop in international division revenues. I fully expect the Q1 result to be on similar lines.  Trefis estimates Amazon‚Äôs valuation at [$134 per share](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/AMZN/no-login-required/p5DVYQLL/Amazon-AMZN-Valuation-Is-AMZN-Stock-Expensive-Or-Cheap-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230427), which is 22% above the current market price of around $110.   **Revenues expected to top the estimates**  [Amazon‚Äôs revenues grew 9% y-o-y](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/AMZN/no-login-required/HcytK2Km/Amazon-Revenues-How-Does-AMZN-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230427) to $514 billion in FY2022.  * The company witnessed positive growth in net revenues from physical stores (11%), third-party seller services (14%), subscription services (11%), advertising services (21%), and AWS (29%) divisions. We expect the same pattern to continue in Q1. * The net sales from the online stores category marginally decreased in the year to $220 billion. We expect the same trend to continue in Q1. * Overall, we forecast Amazon‚Äôs revenues to touch $560 billion for the full-year 2023.  The estimates follow that Amazon‚Äôs fiscal Q1 2023 net revenues to be around $125.99 billion, slightly above the $124.54 billion consensus estimate.  **EPS is likely to beat the consensus estimates**  Amazon Q1 2023 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.22, 5% above the consensus estimate of $0.21. The adjusted net income decreased from $33.4 billion to -$2.7 billion in FY 2022. It was partly due to an increase in operating expenses and partly because of an unfavorable decrease in non-operating income from $13.3 billion to -$18.2 billion. Markedly, the non-operating income primarily suffered because of a pre-tax valuation loss from an equity investment in Rivian Automotive.  We expect the operating expenses to follow the same trend in Q1. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $1.71 and revenue per share of $55.44 for the full-year 2023.  **Stock price estimate is 22% higher than the current market price**  Remember the $134 evaluation? This was using an RPS estimate of around $55.44 and a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of just above 2x in fiscal 2023. This translates into a price of $134, which is 31% above the current market price. Note that P/E Multiples are based on Share Price at the end of the year and reported (or expected) Adjusted Earnings for the full year.  **What do other Finance Websites Say?**  [TipRanks](https://www.tipranks.com/) also expects Amazon to post strong results. They report that Amazon's cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is likely to remain a significant contributor to the company's overall revenue.  [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/) predicts that Amazon's first-quarter earnings will be driven by its e-commerce and cloud computing businesses. It also notes that AWS (Amazon Web Services) is expected to post revenue of $14.03 billion, representing a YoY increase of 28.6%.   [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/) mentions that in response to an uncertain macro backdrop, management has implemented some aggressive cost-saving measures to boost both profitability and its margin profile. These measures include shutting down unprofitable businesses, reducing its global headcount and reprioritizing resources in an effort to right-size the business. The goal is for amazon (like meta) to emerge leaner and stronger.   For those who don't know the [Tastylive website](https://www.tastylive.com/), they've also provided a comprehensive preview of Amazon's earnings report, highlighting the company's ability to beat expectations in the past. Amazon has a history of surpassing Wall Street's earnings estimates, and it is expected to continue this trend in Q1 2023. However, they also mention potential challenges, such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, that could impact the company's financial performance.  **Amazon Earnings Expected Move**  Take a look at the implied volatility of the options market, we can see what the market perception is on AMZN‚Äôs stock price movement going forward. With an expected move of ¬±$6.55, we are looking at just over a 5% expected move on the current stock price for this earnings announcement, which is not necessarily high for a household name like Amazon. If we were to look further into the June cycle though, we can see that this ¬±$6.55 expected move makes up over 60% of the June cycle‚Äôs expected move, which is a substantial chunk given the circumstances.  AMZN stock is currently trading around $110, and we can see that equidistant out-of-the-money options for the weekly options cycle are trading for around the same price - this tells us that the market is not pricing in any sort of skew for this announcement, which is a perceived high-velocity movement. This basically (unfortunately) offers no indication on whether it's going to move up or down. However, given all the details above, what do *you* think? No seriously, take a moment to think about the information presented before you continue reading and try to think: calls or puts for earnings? We do know that with the stock currently at $110, Amazon's risk-versus-reward profile suggests the stock could produce strong returns in the next 12 to 18 months. *But what about earnings??*  **What to do for today's Earnings**  Given all the considerations above, it would be an absolute degen play to even bother considering going into Amazon for earnings. (Oh.. who am I kidding?( Let's fucking go for it! AMZN 4/28 call spread is looking juicy. Can buy the 115c and sell the 120c for $122. This can offer 4.1x gains if things go our way. Mind you, this is not financial or investment advice - this post is just offering education based on what people tend to look for in a company to make an earnings prediction.

[Deep in $AMZN covered calls,;,; Back in Nov, I sold 21 covered calls for $AMZN with strike $135 for $1 each contract. This means I have 2100 $AMZN stocks and I was trying to gain a 'little' income on my stonks while they were sitting dormant in my account.  Market rallied up and I got screwed up big time. The first time, I sold my covered call for $135 strike was for $1 (i.e. I earned around $2100 for these). Since then, I've been rolling over my covered calls for no profit / no loss, in order to push out the date. It's been three months, and looks like after ER today, AMZN is now \~$175 and tomorrow AM when market opens, each contract will be \~$40. I wish I was happy to see AMZN skyrocket for past 3 months.   I never knew, that $2,100 of covered calls profit will take prevent me from enjoying the ride of ($175-$135)x2100 = $84K profit. :(  Market is unstoppable, what's the way out of this?

[Trash DD, AMZN,;,; Those of you who‚Äôve followed me before know what this is.  Bad DD and wild speculation.   AMZN earnings I‚Äôd expect, to be in the range of a healthy beat while the revenue will lag.  This probably won‚Äôt matter because AWS growth and chip development is the narrative.  AMZN has publically spoken to several cost cutting measures, and I think under Andy they‚Äôll come out swinging for these metrics.    If the market likes the narrative, and I think they will, fundamentals will take a back seat.  The market has been flat and looking for a growth catalyst.  AMZN doesn‚Äôt follow traditional valuation metrics historically.    My position:   Very small,  10 calls at $130 Aug 11.  10 calls at $130 Sept 15.  20 sold put spreads at $120/$115 Aug 18.

[$RKLB Hidden message in PR: Part 2. $AMZN &amp; $RKLB Likely billion dollar deal to be annouced,;,; If you haven't read it already, Here is my first post  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10xlhxa/rklb\_hidden\_message\_in\_new\_pr\_big\_announcement/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10xlhxa/rklb_hidden_message_in_new_pr_big_announcement/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  To sum it up: Rocketlab last week announced that it has signed a contract with a HUGE undisclosed customer for the purchase of its new reaction wheel product (that was designed for this customer) (reaction wheels are an expensive satellite part and mega constellation such as starlink, all satellites need these), and rocketlab built a facility last year to produce these in high volume, each reaction wheel has a retail price of 100-120K each, each satellite needs roughly 4 of them. with each satellite needing to be replaced every 5 years or so, this is a potentially Billions of dollars worth of reoccurring revenue.  ([Rocketlab Builds a massive fucking facility for production of these reaction wheels](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-expands-space-systems-footprint-with-new-high-volume-reaction-wheel-production-facility/))  ([Rocketlab announces new reaction wheel for a "Huge undisclosed mega constellation customer"](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-increases-space-systems-offerings-with-new-products-for-small-satellites/))  Its hard to summarize the whole thing but read my post. I really dig deep in the potential $$  In my post I narrowed it down to be potentially Amazon project Kuipar. which is a huge satellite fleet that would result in Billions of dollars worth of these parts over the next 10 years.  (IM PROBABLY LOSING YOUR INTEREST BECAUSE U DONT KNOW HOW SIGNIFICANT THIS IS, READ TO THE END I PROMISE U ITS WORTH THE TIME)  Well Im fucking doubling down, here is fucking why.  Adam Spice (Rocketlab CFO) a few days ago attended an event and did a presentation on Rocketlab  An investor asked about the new reaction wheels and he answered this and in his response he said two things that caught my eye  "our new 12ms reaction wheel is much bigger than we've ever done and is really targeted towards that one megaconstellation customer we haven't be able to name, but hopefully once they start launching those satellites, we will be able to disclose who they are"  "and now we enter into an agreement with a mega constellation customer, were its THOUSANDS of reaction wheels per year, and much bigger reaction wheels, and what that does is allow us to build a dedicated, high volume production facility in New Zealand"  ([Video of CFO talking about it](https://twitter.com/NutscapesNFT))  Here is the info we ALREADY KNEW about this constellation. (please read my other post or you might be a bit confused as I might reference some info from their)  \-But in a nutshell these reaction wheels are designed only for satellites 600-650KG (this isn't roughly, it NEEDS to be precise),  \-Obviously a large customer if they built a facility + designed new product for this customer  Now here is where Adam Spice fucked up. Just because he is not a satellite expert, does not mean us internet regards aren't. He gave way too much information and I have narrowed it to who it could be  So First off I went through every mega constellation planning to be launched (or already launched and sorted by the size of the satellite from 600-650KG  This really only fucking narrows in down to Amazons project Kuipar (Amazons starlink competitor), this is an abnormally large satellite, the only other sat that resemble the size range include the following (see my other post for exact breakdown)  In the video Adam Spice stated that they have not yet launched their satellites yet, which even further narrows it down to project KUIPAR (they have not launched yet)  Adam Spice also said "once they start launching those satellites, we will HOPEFULLY be able to disclose who they are". THIS IS HUGE, THIS TELLS US THEY CANNOT DISCLOSE. they want to disclose the customer, but they cant  Why aren't they able to disclose it on their own terms?  Because the company they are launching for is a fucking public company.  If it was a private company they sold to, why would the private company give a flying fuck? also they won't be legally bound to not disclose it, it would be THEIR OPTION as manufacturer. (unless the private company made some weird confidentially clause, which would be very unusual and bizzare as a private company.  Aso we already knew it was going to be a huge contract given they made a new product and facility for it, but Adam nailed the cherry on top. "We will be making THOUSANDS OF THESE for this customer"  Now each sat is different but its roughly 4 reaction wheels per satellite, (not much of a range, some could need SLIGHTLY more or less)  Thousands (PLURAL) of reaction wheels PER year IS A FUCKING HUGE FLEET  were talking A BASE Of 250 satellites per year (Its MORE, im just using 1000 per year as a starting)  I went through Wikipedia, looked at all the data from satellite fleet size, if they have already started launching or not, public or private, size of satellites (Mass in KG)  Not only does Amazon project Kuipar meet the criteria for ALL of these facts that we know, but all of them simatenaously. VERY FEW of these satellite fleets meet 2+ of these criteria, I could only find a few other other satellites fleets that even resembled the size (off by 50KG in sat size, but even then its hypothetical as reaction wheels must be put in place for exact size of sat), never mind the other conditions.  Some other honourable mentions include  Telesat constellation which satellites are 150KG oversized, and total fleet wouldn't even need 1000 reaction wheels total. (also planning to launch in 2025 lol)  EVEN FUCKING SCRAPPING ALL THE CONDITIONS I LISTED ABOVE, from the video it sounds like the satellites will be launching soon  [Project Kuiper launching sometime "early 2023"](https://www.satelliteinternet.com/providers/project-kuiper/)  Lets do some more fucking MATH!  if they do supply reaction wheels to project KUIPAR.  3236 Planned satellites to be launched  100-120K per reaction wheel  [Pricing sheet](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/assets/Uploads/Rocket-Lab-12-Nms-RW4-RW5-reaction-wheel-datasheet.pdf)  Lets go low end at 100k Per reaction wheel  4 reaction wheels per satellite  3236 Sattelites, (keep in mind Leo mega constellation sats die every 5 years roughly and will be replace with new reaction wheels)  Were talking 1.3 billion of reoccurring revenue.  Also even if its not Amazon project Kuipar, which I really do think it is. There really isn't too many mega constellations planning to be launched anytime soon lol  CFO at least confirmed with us that they will be making thousands of reaction wheels per year for this one mega constellation customer (IM TALKING ABSOULUTE BARE MINIMUM)  He said thousands as in plural  so 2000 reaction wheels  he said per year  so lets go 1 year  1 years of manufacturing 2000 wheels per year for one customer = 200million $  What are your guys thoughts? It seems clear as day to me. Can anyone point to who else this would be, im open to counter arguments?  is it just lack of knowledge on the sattelite parts and space industry the reason this hasn't reacted yet? Im freaking out over this, but no one seems to match my energy here lol, im the only one who posts about rocketlab hahahah.

Then, $UPS missed earnings and I decided to drop 500 of my $AMZN shares 'cause your boy ain't about to lose the house over Bezos‚Äô baby.  So, this week was wild. The market had a seizure during trading hours, but then $MSFT &amp; $GOOG reported and it's like we hopped on a rocket straight to the moon. Tech stocks went absolutely bonkers and I caught $MSFT, but that‚Äôs for another post.  And then, our Lord and Savior, $META, crushed earnings on Wednesday. Sentiment flip-flopped like a fish out of water. Clearly, these mega-cap stocks were beating expectations and were hella undervalued.  What happened next? Well, the Nasdaq $QQQ went up nearly 3%, and Amazon shot up 4.5% to almost $110. Now, usually, I'd slap on a +5 to +10% call option, but not this time. No siree, I was going in raw hoping I won‚Äôt have 18-years bad luck the next morning.  So, $AMZN reported and it just exploded - from $110 to $122 in under 2 minutes. They beat EPS by 50% and revenue by $3 billion. Absolute madness. But, like a true WallStreetBets veteran (check my all-time hottest post), I knew what to do.  An hour later, the earnings call was scheduled. Y'know, where they get into the nitty-gritty and talk about future guidance (aka the mood killer). I figured a 22% gain in a month was more than enough tendies, so I started selling off my shares after-hours. It dipped a bit from the $122 high, but I still came out on top.  And now, the aftermath: $AMZN is sitting at $105.00 - Current position: 4 shares. Feels good, man.

[Hit. Hit. Miss. Hit. Some of y'all probably wondering what happened after I missed AMD. I BOUGHT AMZN,;,; [AMZN position (and some throwaway appl puts for fun which I probably missed on)](https://imgur.com/tsX4uk2)  17 2/2 150C  -10 2/2 165C  10 12/20 150C  In summary: 17 naked calls at 150 , 10 of them being Dec 20th expiry &amp; 7 150/165C spreads expiring tomorrow. Amazon is at 168.26 as of my writing this and will probably see 170 tomorrow so I'll probably get close to max value on those 7 spreads.  Something I did (that you can see in my [transaction history)](https://imgur.com/C0fzJNo)... I originally had 17 spreads, but was feeling extra bullish today and decided to buy 7 of those short calls back to uncap them. I'm glad I did! My inbox is poppin a little, I'll get to those - but for those that were listening when I kept touting Amazon, I didn't back down from my play.  Regarding my last play (AMD and NDXP calls yesterday) : I made a mistake that was worse than "calling AMD and NASDAQ" - I emotionally sold and realized loss instead of just holding another 24 hours and getting it back.  That said Congrats Amazon bulls. Fuck you Meta bulls (also congrats), and I'll be responding to those who were gloating sometime soon.  Bulls we eating tonight!,;,; 2024-02-01 21:30:16]

It would instantly transform $DISH overnight to become serious wireless player and allow $AMZN to chip away at the big 3. $DISH also recently said they now cover 70% of the USA with their 5G service.  **Unlimited 5G data for $10, $15, $25 for Amazon Prime members?

Dish shares jumped 18% following the news, while shares of Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&amp;T all dropped. (After this story published, Amazon reached out wanting to clarify that Amazon, Verizon and T-Mobile have all denied the rumor that was reported by Bloomberg on June 2. Dish declined to comment. This Industry Voices article is speculation by one industry analyst.)  ## Prime Wireless, powered by Dish?  What had the markets so excited about a potentially transformative tie-up? In a word: timing. The timing could not be more perfect for Dish and Amazon to make each other an offer they can‚Äôt refuse, and for consumers to break away from the retail environment of the big three carriers. Wireless networks, like any other facilities-based business, are monetized through their use and in order to thrive, they need vast numbers of users consuming throughput.  Despite [declining retail customer adoption](https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/dish-drops-another-210k-wireless-subs-2q), Dish‚Äôs wireless efforts to date to field a nationwide 5G network have [just passed 70% coverage](https://about.dish.com/2023-06-15-The-DISH-5G-Network-is-Now-Available-to-Over-70-Percent-of-the-U-S-Population) of the U.S. population and the company has built much of the infrastructure and institutional knowledge necessary to power a nationwide network rollout ‚Äì but only if they can start realizing the benefits of owner economics.  Meanwhile, Amazon, with its giant built-in ecosystem of loyal customers, effortless purchasing and its ability to cross-collateralize ultra-cheap, or even free, wireless service, could be just the catalyst to make that mass customer migration possible. In fact, according to the latest J.D. Power data on wireless customer loyalty, 37% of current wireless customers say they selected their carrier based on price.  Among Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) customers, that rate jumps to 69%.¬†Put another way, 6 in 10 wireless customers of the kind ultimately served by AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon through flanker or other brands like Metro, Cricket and Consumer Cellular are at risk of conquest by a radical Dish/Amazon combo offer.  ## Wireless customers hungry for an alternative  Consider the variables at play: a macroeconomic environment of sky-high inflation where everything feels too expensive and everyone is looking to find ways to cut costs. A ubiquitous digital giant that already has deep customer relationships with nearly every consumer in the country. A hungry and financially motivated outsider that has been plotting a move like this for years. Something new and different in a sea of same. Could these be the beginning of the thread that forces the big three into a model that looks more like what streamers have done to the video subscribers count of cable TV?¬†¬†¬†  While a union of Dish and Amazon does make a lot of sense from a timing and incentivization perspective, those factors alone would not necessarily ensure its success ‚Äì many strategic partnerships have seemed like perfect fits before fizzling out. What makes this potential pairing so intriguing is its clear path to success. Customers already appear to be willing to break free of the big three carriers if the price is right, and that sentiment will only grow stronger if the low-cost carrier is associated with a brand they know and already trust.  Beyond the widespread interest among consumers in switching wireless providers for lower cost alternatives, [eSIM technology](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/esim-cards-faq) has made it even easier for customers to become carrier agnostic. Without physical SIM cards tying customers to the carrier-specific phones, an Amazon/Dish partnership could easily employ a ‚Äútry it, you‚Äôll like it‚Äù strategy deployed through its app to onboard customers in the short-term while angling to retain them for the long haul, all while offering complimentary trials of Amazon/Dish services to boot. Now, what if those prospects were offered to try a Dish-powered wireless network with an Amazon gift card as a kicker?  Amazon has another ace up its sleeve: its existing mesh network. Amazon has already tried to seamlessly connect various customer devices through mesh networks with [Amazon Sidewalk](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/everything-you-need-to-know-about-amazon-sidewalk). Supercharging this connectivity with wireless access network enables a near-term future where a customer‚Äôs Alexa and Echo devices boost the Dish 5G cell phone service with Wi-Fi backhaul. Amazon‚Äôs personal assistant devices are already so ubiquitous that device connectivity would likely be seamless. Forget about more cell towers in residential neighborhoods ‚Äì an inexpensive phone with an Amazon network that could get signal boosts in bad-reception areas of the house would be incentive enough for plenty of customers to switch.¬†  Perhaps most importantly, that‚Äôs two massive, double-digit billion-dollar infrastructure investments (owning an ISP, and building a physical wireless network/acquiring spectrum) that Amazon either already has or doesn‚Äôt have to undertake in order to enter and compete in this space.  ## Where do we go from here?  While Dish likely sees any deal between itself and Amazon as a ‚Äú2024 event,‚Äù according to Chairman Charlie Ergen, it‚Äôs hard to deny that the market conditions make a deal getting done in the near-term a logical conclusion. Two of the big three wireless providers are already vulnerable. Between lagging financial performance, executive shake ups and customer loyalty becoming more and more fleeting, there‚Äôs never been a better time for Amazon and Dish to make a big move. And if it happens, it has a chance to send ripple effects throughout the wireless and retail spaces.  Not everyone agrees, of course. AT&amp;T CFO Pascal Desroches, for one, recently [downplayed](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/atandt-cfo-likens-amazon-mobile-rumor-to-seinfeld-/d/d-id/785359) the likelihood of an Amazon foray into wireless, saying: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sort of like those of you who watch Seinfeld. It‚Äôs a show about nothing. This was a rumor about nothing.‚Äù  To Desroches point, many crucial details ‚Äì like what effect a deal would have on the price of Prime, what infrastructure would need to be enhanced to handle a vast and unexpectedly quick subscriber increase, how device retailers would be incorporated (or wound down ‚Äì Amazon is among the largest seller of mobile phones on the planet) ‚Äì will have to be ironed out. But this could be a deal that makes too much sense to dismiss completely. One way or another, Amazon is likely to come ([back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Phone)) to wireless faster than you can say, ‚Äúone-click purchase,‚Äù and that could be enough to finally lead Dish to the promised land, too.  **The chart looks like it's going to break out to the upside** üöÄ  https://preview.redd.it/g6jcndpxy0eb1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fddad9ac7397d15403140c4d45c2fb5f6471ac0  **The FLOAT is 22% SHORT**  **üçã (Is this the next $GME, $AMC, $CVNA, $SIRI?... $DISH has a legit turn around opportunity with $AMZN)**  https://preview.redd.it/d4ibcvm1z0eb1.png?width=1402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e906c910104319ac19ae85e294cddd4ab313476  **June 2, 2023 rumours surfaced again and you can see the stock reactions below  üëÄ**  https://preview.redd.it/41h3ttx701eb1.png?width=1182&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7200aeaf57ed3f8e730b83f889036a9432c2a31,;,; 2023-07-25 02:45:46]

[It's Prime day again; They tricked me into buying more items than I ever have in the past. Should I be buying long-dated calls on AMZN?,;,; So I go to buy some stuff on amazon, just some stuff I was already going to buy but was waiting for the sales of Prime day just to see what kind of sales I'll get.    So I'm at the checkout, and Amazon asks me if I would just like to buy the stuff now and only pay the taxes and 1/5th of the price right now, and pay the rest later. FOR FREE! NO INTEREST, no loan, no nothing, just agreement that I will pay it over 5 months.    I was, shall we say, INTERESTED!  Well, now I have like 5 times the amount of monies to spend. So what do I do, I go back and buy the more expensive item and throw a few hundred dollars worth of stuff I don't really need yet, but might/could use before Black Friday.   THIS is a GREAT Deal, because if I put it all on my credit card, I would be paying 25% APR, since im riddled with debt. If I saved the money, then we all know I'd be losing to inflation. SO now with AMZN  giving me basically free money, I feel like I can spend again. Stuff I don't need with money I don't YET have.   SO I figured if I then take my wife's weekly earnings and buy AMZN ATM calls I should be able to print the money I need by the time I have to pay it, from the AMZN Automated Teller Machine (see what I did there).   I'm just wondering if everyone on here is having the same experience with this free money stuff on AMZN, because then I would like to go ahead and start "investing" into AMZN for the rest of the year.   ALSO, has everyone else been offered free credit card debt every few months? Everytime I pay off my Credit card, not often, They just ask me if i would like to borrow money for only a 3% fee for 18- months. I figure that beats inflation, so I always just take the cash and pay the other credit cards that are about to start getting the 20%+ APR. and bam, all of a sudden im stress free to "invest" for another year. I'm beating inflation.   On top of this, if I dont have a credit card cleared to move the debt to, one of my banks will offer to give me a cash loan for 0%APR, plus small 3-5% fee, for like 12 to 18 months. Basically I can just keep moving the money around and paying for it with a 3-5% fee every few months.   I'm just curious if everyone in this version of the matrix is experiencing the same glitch, and if that is why the market just secretly just keeps going up. I just keep putting my wife's bi-weekly checks into the market rather than paying bills. AM I DOING IT CORRECTLY?  Thank you for your feedback. I'm just a really confused bear at this time, trying to find my place in the train. ,;,; 2023-07-13 00:27:26]

[$875 - $490k in 2 months,;,; Hello fellow regards.  I am the degen regard with the $52k MSFT calls (sold for 160k).  Everyone has been asking, so i will give the full story the best i can and to the point. Loss &amp; gain porn and dopamine highly fluctuated recently.  Screenshots showing starting, all time low, and currently. (Robinhood fked up and doesnt show %, and shows -37k instead of 875 cause theres a 38k withdrawl from yesterday pending).  TLDR: I gambled my life savings during the last 2 years, going from $217k account to just $875 2 months ago, gained 56,000% since then, currently at 490k. Im 26yr old.  2017 - Feb, 7 2021: Starting investing with robinhood in 2017 and would deposit money pretty often, learned about options (shocker) and hit a high of 274k in Feb of 2021 (total deposits 217k).  2021 - March 20, 2023: Trading options, meme stocks,  and tech earnings led to me losing more than 99% of my account by March 20. I actually had $375 and deposited $500 that day.   March 20 - Today Began trading 0DTE QQQs and weekly AMZN and TSLA swings both calls and puts.  Yesterday i bought like 200k worth of QQQ weekly calls and 100 MSFT 280 calls ($60k) in the morning to cash on the earnings run up and sell before close, because i promised i wouldnt play earnings again (shocker #2)... Anyway i was down 34% and decided to sell.. i put in the order and only 12 calls sold, i canceled it and decided to ride earnings overnight. Woke up and sold it for $160k after market and sold the QQQ calls, account was 458k when i sold.  Right after selling i bought $10k META puts to play earnings and i bought over $275k of 3DTE and weekly QQQ Puts. My account is sitting at 506k now, running up over 57,800% since March 20, 2023.  Bottom line: Im regarded, and i got lucky asf. Dont go trying to chase a $ without expecting to lose it all.

[Fisker (FSR) YOLO Update - 11/13/2023,;,; Original YOLO Post: [Click Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15hszd4/fsr_my_ultimate_regard_yolo_dd/)  Alright boys, it's me again. As promised, I have an update for you. Included in the update is an INCREASE in my position.  All of my prior DD still stands, especially:  * Tesla is king, and will always be the f\*\*king king (glory to the TSLA bulls) * Smart "asset light" business model using Magna (who owns a stake in FSR so they can collaborate on pricing power) - instead of Fisker wasting their time building misaligned shit and hoping no one notices  I'm down 37% since my last post.   https://preview.redd.it/h6w2zwcvr50c1.png?width=741&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea105a1f7e9ca95fe3d10325c55f5a4bfebf0620  So why do I insist on continuing to bend over for my wife's boyfriend? Instead of using my remaining $100K for something productive like wiping my ass with Benjamin Franklin's face every day, I did my homework for the first time since 6th grade:  * **I bought a Fisker car** \- I spent $70K+ (using the other half of my life savings) buying my own Fisker car to see for myself if it is any good. And let me tell you, it is f\*\*king incredible. It looks good, drives smooth, and has tons of space/legroom for picking up...friends on the street. This pic was shot in the middle of a 300+ mile road trip during which I encountered no issues. Tons of people were noticing this car during the trip/stops.  [F\*\*k, this car is beautiful](https://preview.redd.it/ol6s8tbqr50c1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=472b96dc51bf607bf9ae43bd7044fd1ac5940f37)  * **Company is making meaningful money now** \- in addition to shipping great cars, they have at least $70K+ of my own money, and likely in the hundreds of millions already (5000 limited edition reservation holders x $70K = $300M+ revenue...and last I had checked they had 60,000+ total reservation holders waiting on cars) * **Market cap of this company is only $1.36B** \- such a low valuation on what I extrapolate to be hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue and potentially 5000+ cars per quarter?? Compare that to $15B for Rivian with 10,000+ cars per quarter and $9B for Lucid with 2500+ cars per quarter. * **Reviewers still love this car** \- the professional and amateur reviews I'm seeing are all still positive. Still no recalls or widespread major issues that I have heard of. * **Henrik Fisker hate/haters and lame criticism** \- so many haters on this guy. I hate him too, he's a piece of shit. But god damn the hate fuels this magnificent bastard as it does Elon, Greta Thunberg, or king of the cucks Will Smith. The only criticism I see are all irrelevant, like his last venture from 10 YEARS AGO failing, or there's so much competition for EVs (see my last post for why these are regard statements)   https://preview.redd.it/tjexmikwx50c1.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2620b747cfd0cc55f12603d409023f49bb4ce9a0  * **Plan B still in play** \- I always still have my small investments in both AMZN and Uber to lift me up and make me a millionaire if FSR goes tits up.  Anyways, that's it. Not financial advice. I f\*cking love this stock and I love this ride.,;,; 2023-11-13 19:03:29]

[All in Long Term on Globalstar (NYSE: GSAT) - Partnerships with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM),;,; Less than $1.50 a share, this is a great time to get in, on the low end.  Learn from the mistakes of the greatest investor of our time:  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett once said "I blew it," when he passed up on the opportunity to invest in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), not once but twice.  Both in 1994 and in 1997. Don‚Äôt be that guy who reads this post and says "I blew it" in 2043.  A hundred shares at the same price point for AMZN in the 90‚Äôs would have you sitting on 2000 shares at $145 (approx - $300K in value).

[Amazon Balancing On The Edge - Will It Lead Anywhere?,;,; So, the story is that Amazon's been in a tight spot since 2019, dealing with one investigation after another. Each hit caused a blow to $AMZN. But at least the government's taking some action, and the House Committee on the Judiciary also joined all this digging into Amazon.  In short, it all started in 2020 when articles from CNBC, Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal with investigations started dropping, causing stock falls.   The grand finale came in October 2020 with news about the FTCS, triggering another stock drop. And that's how 2020 ended, with Amazon in the headlines.   Then, in 2022, the Wall Street Journal came out with an article about the SEC investigating Amazon, and (surprise) $AMZN fell once again.  Throughout all this, Amazon kept silence about any risks tied to their shady moves. And finally investors [filed a lawsuit](https://11thestate.com/cases/amazon-investor-suit) against them, and it's Washington deal now.  Now, after this whole saga, what's your take? Would you even consider investing in Amazon (kinda sarcastic but still)?,;,; 2023-11-30 15:38:50]

[QQQ Puts ‚ô®Ô∏è‚ô®Ô∏è‚ô®Ô∏è‚ô®Ô∏è,;,; Okay fellow regards, here's my play going into Monday.  I've been digging for a reason not to do this trade and I just can't find one. SP500 insiders have been selling off like crazy. The top 7 or 8 companies in the QQQ are trending down to test critical resistance or already at it.  AAPL - MSFT - META are all gonna go flat, while AMZN and NVDA still have some to give. TSLA... shilit that's a different animal, I'm not touching that one... and GOOG? Well the magic rock says, "this is the time but puts on Google she's going to go test $135 and if it pushes through, there's no critical support till the low 120's." I'm not kidding my magic rock said all of that...  Oil has been on the rise since July, and our government is to cancel Alaska oil/NG leases issued under trump era. Job opening/hires are down about 3% while unemployment is up 8.8%. Inflation and rates aren't stopping, they're just delayed. Like I said the more you dig, the more this makes sense. If anyone can talk me out of this before Monday please get at me on the comments..  As always, there's a chart with crayons for the mouth breathers. Tossed in a spot gamma chart for those of you with half a brain. And before I get the "mY cHaRt dOesN'T lOok Like tHaT". draw your chart and put your money where your mouth is.

[Thought Experiment - If you were forced to invest into a stock based on a metric (and the stock price was hidden) what metric would it be?,;,;   I was thinking to myself - if the news channels and investing platforms wouldn't show the stock price but some other fundamental metric then what would you prefer it be? If this were to be the case, it would  &amp;#x200B;  1. help us invest more soundly on a      fundamental basis ; 2. avoid people "fomoing"      into a stock when it has run up and, 3. also help us to avoid selling when      the stock price has fallen - as seeing the fundamental metric instead of      the stock price would provide us with a better info - or even the calrity      to buy the stock as its now available cheaper.   For eg: For AMZN P/OCF is touted as a better measure to keep track of for investing into AMZN. If below 20/22 then it's touted as a good buying opportunity and not a good opportunity if its above that.   What would your preferred metric be? I understand its not possible to have a one-size-fits-all metric but as it's a thought experiment, we are not limited - we can even have multiple metrics but the key is the stock price is hidden,;,; 2023-09-26 17:02:25]

[Google, Amazon, and Unity are among the tech companies implementing layoffs to start 2024,;,; Google, Amazon, and Unity are among the tech companies implementing layoffs to start 2024, echoing trends observed in 2023. Tech firms persist in cost-cutting, efficiency improvement, and adapting to a cooling labor market. The U.S. unemployment rate stands at 3.7%, a near 50-year low, yet recent months have seen a slowdown in job gains. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employers added 105,000 workers in October, 173,000 in November, and 216,000 in December, below the 2023 monthly average of 225,000.   Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) confirmed on Thursday that it is laying off hundreds of staff across its voice assistant, hardware, and engineering teams. A Google spokesperson mentioned organizational changes, including role eliminations globally, aligning with product priorities.  Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman are reportedly leaving the company after Google's $2.1B acquisition in 2021, amidst competition with the Apple (AAPL) Watch. Alphabet also made several cuts in 2023, including an announcement in January to eliminate roughly 12,000 jobs.  Unity Software (NYSE:U) announced a 25% staff cut this week, aiming to restructure and refocus its core business for long-term and profitable growth. Approximately 1,800 employees are impacted, with the company unable to reasonably estimate costs associated with the reduction until the first quarter of 2024. Despite revenue growth, Unity has struggled to turn a profit, leading to a 20% decline in shares over the past six months.  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to cut several hundred employees in its media units, including Prime Video and MGM Studios. Reports suggest a 35% reduction in the Twitch workforce, affecting around 500 workers, and a 5% cut in the Audible workforce. Like tech counterpart Alphabet, Amazon made various employment cuts in the previous year.  Xerox (NASDAQ:XRX) announced a 15% reduction in its workforce in the first quarter of this year as part of a restructuring plan. The plan focuses on improving and stabilizing the core print business, increasing productivity through a new Global Business Services organization, and directing Digital Services and IT Services capabilities towards more profitable markets. This restructuring follows a 6% year-over-year decline in third-quarter sales.,;,; 2024-01-14 15:16:45]

[BIG WEEK AHEAD,;,; We have Fed speak and six significant earnings reports with forward guidance this coming week.  My thoughts:  JPOW &amp; Committee has no reason at all to do six rate cuts this year so far.  Too bad - the economy would boom otherwise.  He won‚Äôt declare victory and most likely will remain cautious.  I think the market needs to get over the Fed and move on.      Tuesday the fun begins:  MSFT -  red hot!   The tunes are full blast - can they dance?   They have three businesses to report on plus AI.  Microsoft 365, Asure cloud, &amp; personal computing- XBOX, Bing, Surface, and Activision.  Their yoy earnings is expected to increase 19%.  They been pushing AI close to two years now - show me the money!  Would like to see  yoy revenue growth of at least 25% based on their price. I think they are over bought.    GOOGL -  is expected to grow earnings by 53% to roughly $ 1.61.  Let‚Äôs see how search and YouTube does.  Maybe they have a new AI story to tell.  Over bought I think.     AMD -  is expected to grow earnings by 12% to roughly $0.77.   It‚Äôll be about forward guidance I believe.   I like what I hear about the 8000G processors with lower power graphics and innovative content creation capabilities.   They have a strong story as well with their neural processing unit(NPU) Ryzen A for PC‚Äôs. Over bought but will continue to kick ass I think.  Thursday:  AAPL - is expected to grow earnings 12% with flat yoy revenue.  Really don‚Äôt see any surprise to the upside.  Heard the Apple Pro Vision isn‚Äôt gaining any app‚Äôs on Netflix‚Äôs.    Really no growth story so far.  Sell.   AMZN -big Q upcoming.   They need to demonstrate they can make big money.  They are expected to grow earnings from $0.03 to 0.79/share.  Use them a lot - we‚Äôll see.  Meta - expected to grow earnings by 66% to $5 roughly.  Meta plans to have 350,000 Nvidia H100 chips to drive its data centers &amp; AI by end of 2024. Year of efficiency is over I think.     I‚Äôm hoping for a flat week, but do have puts on MSFT &amp; APPL.   My opinion only.   Your thoughts!,;,; 2024-01-28 05:28:20]

[I am bullish on $CHYNA,;,; First off, let me say that I clearly understand how bad China stocks have been since their peak in 2021. Not only have they come out of the pandemic at an anemic growth rate, the housing crisis, corrupt government, and the list goes on have been very large headwinds.  However, when a stock is trading at 10x PE and still growing at 15% YoY without even touching their AI capabilities, I think a lot of these mega cap China stocks are a steal at these prices.  1. Sentiment is at an all time low. Literally everyone is done with China stocks and refuses to buy them 2. Hedge funds have been piling in since the beginning of the year when $BABA was at $67 and $BIDU was st $98 3. Chinas downturn has likely already happened and the growth story will be back by the end of the year 4. $BIDU has a 10 year floor at $90-100. If it breaks below that, it‚Äôs game over but until then, this is a massive floor to buy at 5. $BABA is at IPO price and has grown revenue 10x since then. Really??   I‚Äôm show their are even more contrarian and value indicators to look at but I‚Äôm convinced. I‚Äôm holding 100s of shares of commons in each and $20k in leap calls across both names. They may not reach their peak in 21‚Äô anytime soon but I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre a safe 50-100% gain from here with patience.  My last point is look at mega cap tech stocks in Oct. 22‚Äô. Don‚Äôt you wish you bought $META $TSLA at $90? $AAPL at $120? $AMZN $GOOG at $80? This feels like that same chance.  Let me know your thoughts in the comments!,;,; 2024-02-01 05:25:16]

[Market Outlook 10/25/2023,;,; **Recap On This Tuesday‚Äôs Market Action:**  * SPY closed up 0.75% * QQQ closed up 0.97% * Dow Jones Industrial closed up 0.62% * VIX closed down 6.88%  Good evening everyone, I hope you all have had an excellent and productive Tuesday! Today we saw the major indices pop at the open and trade relatively flat throughout the day closing only slightly higher than the open. There are major earnings reports being released this week so it will be interesting to see how the market reacts to these reports.  https://preview.redd.it/dabbyy7le8wb1.png?width=2261&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5eb1a3339b5847607718b02b99fc91f532e5a01  SPY gapped up from its close on Monday and appears to be starting to bounce off of the 200 day EMA (white line). SPY did however undercut the recent low set earlier this month. The bounce off of the 200 day EMA coupled with the hopefully positive earning reports this week may help push SPY higher. However, as always, we cannot predict the future. If earnings are weaker than expected SPY may take a sharp dive below the 200 day EMA.  https://preview.redd.it/7ffs8kple8wb1.png?width=2284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ff5391196965951a55342694931be2c3bf5afa2  QQQ is still well above its 200 day EMA. However, we still did see an undercut of the earlier October lows yesterday. This week‚Äôs earnings will definitely impact the tech heavy NASDAQ as Microsoft ($MSFT) and Alphabet ($GOOGL) reported after today‚Äôs close and Meta ($META), IBM ($IBM), Amazon ($AMZN), and Intel ($INTL) report later this week. As with SPY, if earnings are worse than expected we may see a quick drop to the 200 day EMA.  **GOLD List Stocks:**  https://preview.redd.it/hrt24idme8wb1.png?width=2276&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e700c2df2af2b0fc1572763cc012d6406b279dc  AAPL is behaving quite nicely given the recent market action. While it has been trending downward since the beginning of August, AAPL is holding up better than many others. If the overall market picks up and AAPL reports positive earnings next week, we could see a break of the recent October highs of $183.  https://preview.redd.it/iq5f11wme8wb1.png?width=2263&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3b2ce9409806f96ce084b4026b575bc4c377adca  AMZN has a very similar story to AAPL. AMZN is still above the previous October lows and may test the 50 day EMA if earnings come out positive.  https://preview.redd.it/8f9midjne8wb1.png?width=2277&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96d05e58cba830bf6c2644bed2246eed9d898013  GOOGL has been steadily trending upward over the past few months. GOOGL reported earnings today and as of writing this is now down 6.49% in after hours trading. It is important to keep in mind that after hours price moves do not always translate into the next day trading session.  https://preview.redd.it/vnkjqe9oe8wb1.png?width=2274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e5f59238cdb4d03efc190c0245cf7b64e1e14f00  META has seemed to have had a stall in price movement since mid July. The 8 and 21 day EMA‚Äôs are very close together and the 50 day EMA has continued to plateau. Earnings come out tomorrow after the close.  https://preview.redd.it/cl456xpoe8wb1.png?width=2278&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=899fbea96f43d7e1d0bca5a9c904781e9dc57c19  MSFT has stayed close to its October high and seems to be bouncing off of the 8 day EMA. MSFT reported earnings after hours today and is currently gapping up around 5%. Again, this may not translate into the trading session tomorrow.  https://preview.redd.it/bkrphv7pe8wb1.png?width=2269&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e2dc22af3564f2c23e12dad823e0554af801f0e  NVDA has been range trading from $400 to $500 since mid June. NVDA does not report earnings till the end of Novemeber but will likely be heavily influenced by other companies and the overall market. I opened a starter position in NVDA today as it took out the little base that formed halfway through last week.  https://preview.redd.it/hle6izqpe8wb1.png?width=2274&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c71f05d2a8cccac1caec4759e11df6f3da40fefc  TSLA reported earnings last week and gapped down heavily. Price seems to have come to rest on the 200 day EMA for now. TSLA also has a multi year downward sloping trendline, shown in yellow. The last time price came near this line it was rejected heavily. If TSLA is able to rally to this trendline it will take a lot of buying power to overcome it.  **Bringing everything together:**  For now, the market seems to be catching its breath after heavy selling at the end of last week. However, there are several big earnings reports coming out which may push the market in one direction or the other. While there may be a number of stocks with valid setups, it would be wise to err on the side of caution until the majority of earnings reports have been released.

And have much more options activity overall for that date then any other exp date currently available.  That being said, the next big date for options activity is the triple witching date **Mar 15** (this is when Quarterly, Monthly, and Weekly options all expire on the same date)  **MAR 15 OPEN PUTS/CALLS**  Ticket    /    Open Puts  /   Open Calls     /      Put/Call Ratio  \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  APPL:      /     267K          /      292K          /              0.92  MSFT:    /      103K         /       103K          /             1.00  GOOGL:   /   153K         /        117K          /             1.30  AMZN:     /   188K         /         208K          /             0.87  NVDA:    /    168K         /        116K           /            1.44  META:    /      56K          /          60K           /             0.93  TSLA:    /       352K         /         323K        /              1.09  \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Looking at this date shows a bearish sentiment going into the end of the first quarter. With 4 of the stocks actually having a 1.00 or higher put/call ratio indicating bears in control of options volume for those dates.  **Summary**  Important thing to keep in mind is that the market tends to react a bit earlier (1-2 weeks) to options activity then the actual exp date. Based off the options activity for the next 3-4 months the market is pricing in a top early to mid January with a selloff going into the end of the first quarter.

The earnings came out and were stellar, they aren't losing as much money as they use to and are on an exponential growth path. Tomorrow they will be up BIG! However, I don't think this one is done. I am rolling my options (I have about this many in Robinhood and SOFI as well) out a couple months to give myself some more time. I think they keep running for the next couple of weeks for the following reasons:  \- Good earnings (duh).  \- Short interest is decent and will need to cover over the next couple days.  \- Low volume on this stock can cause it to swing super fast if we get some movement. I've been watching and the downswings are on lower volume than the upswings. I don't think there are a ton of people who want to sell shares.  \- $40 strike calls are already in the money and I think $45s will be tomorrow causing pressure up.  \- People are looking for the next NVDA, and this fits the bill (AI, works with all the big players AMZN, GOOG, etc, and machine learning)   What do you think? How dumb am I?  Position right now, expiring Friday: 257 $40c, 167 $45c, 45 $50c,;,; 2024-02-14 23:37:27]

[FSR - My Ultimate Regard YOLO + DD,;,; **TL;DR - I put roughly half of my savings ($150K+) into an EV company stock (FSR) that is literally last to the party, likely even too late. YOLO**  Alright boys. Hear me out.  First of all, I f\*\*king love Tesla. No one is going to beat them to become the new #1 at EVs. Anyone who believes that is lying to themselves, probably lost their mind wanking off to skibidi toilets. (And btw, I wish all the glory to you regards who got in TSLA and are riding that shit to the moon)  All I'm saying, is that every Intel has their AMD. Every iPhone lover has that annoying as shit Android asshole nagging them about features their phone has that literally no one cares about (or that anyone actually uses other than by losers named "Kevin").  I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out which of these other annoying EV wannabes is going to get there. Here's why I think it is going to be Fisker (NYSE: FSR)    * **Outsourced manufacturing to Magna** \- instead of wasting billions of dollars building their own factories to end up with misaligned doors and flaming batteries (as well as high burn rate), they are having Magna Steyr build their cars, the same contract manufacturer that already manufacturers specific cars for the global brands (Mercedes G-Class, BMW 5 Series, Jaguar E-Pace, Toyota Supra). This makes them extremely capital efficient, and since Magna also took an equity stake in Fisker, they can collaborate to maintain pricing power without compromising either party's upside. * **Traction** \- 60,000+ reservations already, and in progress delivering the first 5,000 "Ocean Ones" limited edition variant. If they finish delivering these, that's already $340M+ in revenue.  * **Positive reviews so far** \- Not sure if I am allowed to post links, just search "Fisker Ocean Review" on YouTube. * **Low relative valuation (compared to shit competition)** \- FSR currently sits at \~$2B market cap. Lucid is at \~$14B. Rivian is \~$25B. Nio is \~$26B. Lordstown market cap is \~2 Wendy's burgers. If FSR finishes delivering just half of their reservations by the end of the year, that's more than Rivian. And WAY more than the 1,400 BJs that Lucid has been giving behind the dumpster to convince people to buy their overpriced slap in the face.  * **CEO is an experienced regard** \- Henrik Fisker is annoying as shit, but he designs some goddamn beautiful cars (BMW Z8, Aston Martin, etc.). Most of the Fisker lineup (SUV, Pickup, supercar) looks even hotter than my wife's boyfriend. * **An affordable car option for even WSB regards who lost their YOLOs** \- FSR is on track to have a $29K "everyman" (yes, including for you dumbass who lost your inheritance on YOLO SPY 0DTEs) vehicle that will be shipping in 2024.  * **Flexible lease** \- starting and stopping a lease at any time instead of getting f\*\*ked by the car dealer for 3 years without them buying you dinner  There's more if you dig deeper (e.g. their car has the highest range of any EV SUV - 360 miles) and they have the lowest carbon footprint of any EV (including the use of recycled materials, solar panels on the car, etc.). Some people like thinking about the f\*\*king planet instead of where their next crayon meal is coming from. And they'll make a car buying decision based on that thought process too.  A few months ago I took my first position in FSR (see post history for proof, originally 16,228 shares).  As of today, I have 23,500 shares (\~$150,000 at the current price) with plans to buy more. (Proof attached below)  Counter-arguments I expect from you assholes:  * **"BuT FiSkEr'S lAsT vEnTuRe FaIlEd"** \- Sometimes you get on the toilet and fail to shit. Next time you plop the biggest shit of your life. Henrik has clearly learned his lesson by outsourcing the manufacturing this time and securing a partnership with a battery maker that isn't employing my 2 year old niece to assemble their cathodes or whatever the f\*\*k batteries are made of. * **"ThErE'S sO mUcH cOmPeTiTiOn"** \- Yeah, true regards think that an ICE maker will make better EVs. There's a reason Ford and GM have their lots full of their shit EVs. Tesla represents more than just a car to people. There' a reason iPhone users don't switch to Android on features alone. Fisker is building that "lifestyle" brand by touting their sustainable approach with the low carbon footprint I mentioned above. It's literally in their mission statement - to be the most emotional and sustainable vehicle. And do you think too much competition stopped Google? Or Zoom? Lots of competition means the market is still fragmented, there is no one true king yet. And as much as I love Tesla too, not everyone wants to drive around in an egg. *  "ThE cAr Is UgLy" - so is your wife's boyfriend, but that doesn't stop her. Eye of the beholder or whatever  Once FSR beats Lucid's deliveries, by my rough multiplicalculations I project it to 7x to at least Lucid's valuation. That makes my price target $36 (not that much higher than its ATH). From there the next milestone is Rivian's valuation for a total of 12x-13x gain - the second price target will be $78.  Obligatory **NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**. I like this stock. I'm ready for the most emotional and sustainable ride of my life diamond handing this shit.  My position proof: (Yes I hedged myself with 16 shares of AMZN and 47 shares of UBER just in case. That should make up for any potential losses when those two stocks probably moon at some point too)   https://preview.redd.it/l559pqxpi1gb1.png?width=857&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ce09f786b64e7ab4ae40263869590cb184b4d89,;,; 2023-08-04 07:16:55]

[Why I don't think NVDA party gonna last,;,; I know I know - you all think NVDA can reach higher than the sky, but here is why I say they don't. In fact, here is why I say they have already outburnt their rocket!   Look at the list below.    there are only 5 companies at the $1T club, and number 6 and 7 are fighting their asses off to get in. now lets talk about ALL of them, and why NVDA isn't one of them:     1. MSFT has just this week gained supremacy and passed AAPL. There's no argue why MSFT is one of the top 5 companies in the world. They control more than 60% of all OS on all computers on the entire planet, they have access to us all with their products, and they control 22% of could services world wide with Azure. billions of users world wide uses products they 100% own, and profit of with no middleman anywhere. That's dominancy! That's not talking about LinkedIn which is considered to be the best professional social network, and they sure as fuck monetize this. 2. AAPL since they dropped Intel's processors for the M1 and later M2, they control end-to-end of their production process and have roughly 50% market share of wealthy users world wide, plus 26% of mobile users globally. Not sure if they truly invented it, but they have perfected the subscription profit model, and controlling the spending of their huge users base fiercely! And I bet there's a hidden report out there showing they control the majority of the top dome of socio-economic group. BTW a friend of mine working as senior full stack at MSFT told me they gave him a MacBook when he started working for Microsoft. He's developing MS-Office on a MacBook!!!!!  3. Saudi-Aramco - I know shit about them, but they control oceans of oil and you know.... oil is oil 4. Google - 98% market share for online searches. plus, over 70% global market share of mobile OS and 12% share of  cloud service. All in-house and 100% owned by Google. Oh yeah, and don't forget about Youtube. Oh BTW - do you drive much? did you know that to avoid competition, Google bought Waze too? 5. AMZN - Well to be honest, I don't believe they have a strong valuable market place anymore and I am pessimistic about their retailing now days. In fact I heard somewhere (and I can't find it now) that they lost almost $10B on their forward sellings in 2022, BUT!!!! they earned over $20B off advertising on site which covers the returns and customer's care. we can argue about that, but we can't argue about the crown jewel of AMZN - AWS!!!! 33% of all data on could, is located on an AWS server. You know NFLX, DIS, and WBD streaming services? Along with Amazon prime, they are all located on the same fucking servers!!!! In fact, unless you're watching Youtube or AppleTV, if you're watching streamers, you're watching it off an AWS server!  6. NVDA - let's roll back to it later 7. Meta - I do hate that evil empire, but there's no argue that there's no other company with as much user data as they have. Between Instagram, Facebook, whatsapp - if you want to talk or meet someone, it's probably through one of their platforms, and they monitor it. 8. Tesla - I hate Elon! I think he should be in jail for violating at least 10 SEC regulations. But he's still out there and roaming. I won't argue that TSLA is A-Z solution to car manufacturing. Everything is In-house as well, and the marketing expenses are 0!!! But in a world where everybody are looking for autonomous vehicles, Elon's got the most data collected in the world. When they talked about creating a center control for autonomous driving, they suggested Tesla will be the center since they have the biggest data centers dedicated for it.   &amp;#x200B;  Now lets get back to NVDA - 10 years ago, they were nothing. A great product for a special segment of hardcore computer users willing to spend $200-$500 on hardware no one else even knows needed.   Back then Intel was God and AMD tried biting on them. But got no where close.    Then AI kicked in, and engineers found out GPU are better to teach the modules rather than CPU and guess who's the best GPU manufacturer? wait no!!! It's not NVDA! They have never manufactured a single processor. They don't have a single factory. They do it all with TSMC (number 11 on the list, but around 1/3 the value on NVDA).   Ok so they have the best design. Fuck!!! no they don't!! They use ARM technology to design their processors ($74B market cap). And why ARM are so important? well because couple months ago, NVDA wanted to buy them, so the US regulator looked this deal up, and found out these 2 companies are the only 2 companies to design such technologies and by buying them, NVDA will basically eliminate the competition, and be a full monopoly on ARM architecture processors. so how come one company is worth $74B and the other $1.4T??? because they design the best AI training processors.  WAIT!!!! FUCK they don't!!!!! haven't you heard?? AMD just steamrolled them with Frontier ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier\_(supercomputer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_(supercomputer)))     AMD has had the best week in their life!! how good? $250B good. That's still 1/6 of NVDA.   And wait, I mentioned Intel several times before, but what's the deal with them? Well in a nut shell, they have dragged behind. They used to have an enormous market share of processors in the market and they got cocky and neglected R&amp;D while the rest rushed to innovate. But even though you are probably reading this on an Intel based computer, or have one at work/home, and they used to be the sole suppliers for Apple computers, Intel at it's peak was worth $273B (Jan 31st 2020). Still fraction of NVDA's worth. And in opposed to NVDA, ARM and AMD - Intel has always owned their own factories, meaning their worth should combine NVDA and TSMC together!!!!  So the question remains - WTF??????       &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/5xbjatheg8dc1.jpg?width=1036&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4564c4053a764084a6dfca02474ce66d606225c7,;,; 2024-01-18 18:27:58]

[6=22=23 Volume moving tickers,;,; Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers Fundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment‚Äôs price.¬† I look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.¬† The shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.

[META Earnings Today, why not grab calls?,;,; Bullish on META ahead of Earnings  Meta Platforms (META) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q3 2023 results today. Last quarter, they kicked ass with 11% YoY revenue gains, hitting a cool $32 billion. Daily active users and ad impressions? Up 5% and 34%, respectively. But hold on‚Äîaverage price-per-ad fell 16% YoY. Expecting similar vibes this quarter, but what's the play?  Let's rewind a bit. META stock was a rollercoaster‚Äîup 15% from early 2021, sitting pretty at $310. But it wasn‚Äôt smooth sailing, folks. We saw +23% in 2021, a bloodbath of -64% in 2022, and then a moonshot of +156% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&amp;P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 10% in 2023 - indicating that META underperformed the S&amp;P in 2021 and 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&amp;P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for other heavyweights in the Communication Services sector including GOOG, NFLX, and CMCSA, and even for the megacap stars TSLA, MSFT, and AMZN. It's like they're playing catch up.  Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could META face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&amp;P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?  Well considering this year has been the 'year of efficiency' for Meta Platforms, with the company‚Äôs quarterly results in 2023 regularly bringing fireworks post-earnings. I'm certainly bullish. During the earnings, I will be interested in the company‚Äôs Reality Labs performance, a segment that includes Meta‚Äôs augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware, software, and content. The segment has come under scrutiny in the past following concerns about its profitability. However, analysts are expecting growth with this segment.  Any losses from it's virtual reality will be a drop in the bucket anyways as META's main money maker is advertising. So I'll also be watching for active user growth. Meta's ad growth is expected to spike 25% yoy in the third quarter and through 2024 with rising Reels engagement and monetization. However we should keep an eye on "paid social" as a new form of revenue (subscriptions).  Despite the details, I think it's worth getting a call for META before earnings. I'm going to grab META 10/24 320c @ 5.75. We would need a 6.5% increase to break even.,;,; 2023-10-25 19:15:26]

[Arbitraging the AI potential misspriced in some stocks that will become the leaders,;,; **GOOGLE**I have been very bullish on Google given MSFT stock performance but for some reason the market has been lagging. MSFT has been driven up, up and up based on Sam Altman, Open AI, GPT, and AI, AI, AI. The Bing supposedly takeover of Google Search was a FIASCO, won't happen.  Google's Deep Mind is another level. Not a generative text bullshitting your prompts. Google is the only actor that has been serious on AI since 2015. Now they are proving to you - have you seen the Gemini AI release? [Google launches its largest and ‚Äòmost capable‚Äô AI model, Gemini](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/06/google-launches-its-largest-and-most-capable-ai-model-gemini.html)  Google should be trading in the 160$ range by now - But it's ok, market is lagging.  Ignore AI, google without AI is the best tech business you can buy.  **AMD**  Just anounced: [Meta and Microsoft say they will buy AMD‚Äôs new AI chip as an alternative to Nvidia‚Äôs](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/06/meta-and-microsoft-to-buy-amds-new-ai-chip-as-alternative-to-nvidia.html)  It is a matter of time that NVIDIA loses its momentum. It was nice to see a 1200% YoY revenue growth - that's really impresive. But... AMD and other actors want a piece of that cake, NVIDIA won't be able to eat it alone for longer. Chip buyers are already feeling the supply shortage or overprice in their pockets so they are looking for alternatives. AMD is the next best player known, right?  AMD hasn't rallied like NVIDIA. It is still trading as pre-AI thing.  &amp;#x200B;  These are the 2 most clear companies that you can buy at a fair to cheap valuation. I am not touching MSFT, nor NVIDIA, nor APPLE at this valuation. Either AMZN, AMD or GOOGL run a 2x from current level or the other 3 mentioned have a correction of 30% to 40%.

[What recession?,;,;   Why the ‚Äúrecession‚Äù seems to not be happening.. in most places.  Basically, it comes down to secular growth trends and money flow. Despite the fact that there are high interest rates, slowing retail spending, layoffs, high debt, low cash reserves- the sky appears to not be falling. It will however, happen in some places.   Right now, there are industries, cities, and technologies that are going to suffer, but there are also ones that will do well. There are cities, for example, that are ripe for a housing crash (San Francisco, Phoenix, Nashville). There are industries and companies who, if they don‚Äôt keep up with AI, won‚Äôt make it. The companies who have been driving AI- MSFT, NVDA, AAPL, AMZN, ADBE, etc, have all done well so far in 2023. The movement and velocity of money, while slowing down in the macro sense, still hasn‚Äôt broadly affected companies with strong cash positions and competitive moats.   All of it has the same common thread- some areas will suffer and some areas will boom. We find these by evaluating leadership, policy, and catalysts for growth.   Things can come to a grinding halt if the consumer is in such a tight spot that money stops flowing- however that is also not really happening yet, and it would seem as if the federal reserve doesn‚Äôt truly want to get to that point. Political climates could change and influence this, but that probably won‚Äôt happen until the next presidential election. Technically, if year over year GDP growth starts to go negative, then we are in a recession. Even still, there will be opportunities that arise out of that, like a cooled down real estate market, and maybe some stocks at discounted valuations. Right now, there are definitely stocks that have been ignored compared to the AI rally, and may be ripe for buying.   Typically my basic initial checklist looks like this: Is this company profitable? Is it run well? Does the leadership have a vision and good follow-through?  Does it have a strong cash position?  Does it have a competitive moat?  Am I buying a great company at a fair price? What are the catalysts for future growth?  There are many more factors to take into account but this is a good place to start. You can modify and apply these principles to real estate as well.,;,; 2023-06-11 02:26:02]
[Hello Earnings Season,;,; Earnings season has arrived. Some of you may say, oh why did the stock fall...they beat expectations, they gave great guidance, blah blah blah..

The quarter before MSFT fell down by 5% (the same MSFT that is now at $400) because of capex associated with AI investments...well that's what they say.   My point is- it doesn't make sense.

But excluding cars and gasoline, the decline was better than market expectations. The big banks kicked off the 23Q1 fiscal quarter with a sound of crisis, the major banks still made a lot of money.

Other C, WFC results also exceeded market expectations, driving a collective pre-market rise in financial stocks.  \-Shares news: Dow component UNH results exceeded expectations, raised full-year guidance, shares rose slightly. BA again suffered parts quality problems, cut 737Max payments, shares plunged -6%. After MSFT and GOOGL, AMZN also unveiled its AI platform yesterday.  \-Treasuries and gold retreated before the market, and the dollar index rallied. Stocks were mixed, with the Nasdaq down mid-range and the S&amp;P and Nasdaq down slightly.  \-SPY rallied strongly yesterday reversing the previous day's down move, though it still did not break the key pressure $ 413-414 area hinted at in recent days, which remains a key intraday test to the upside.

I had been burned on CPI before (see other posts about losing 210k in about 4 seconds last year) so bought some puts as a hedge on other positions and DCAd a bit too aggressively and ended up with 7800 contracts at a price of \~.17.  Lots were 10s of thousands on bid/ask but when I tried to close, it shrank to 1 to 50 and the candle would jump on each limit order (had to market sell) as this is approx $300,000,000 in notional value.  (Schwab also sucks balls on option order execution).  Instead of 600k+ in gains, I ended up closing for 15k in gains with a hurt mojo at the money I could have had and had fun losing later.  Last week I wanted to enter an iron condor but by the time my money swept from my futures account, it was too late.  On this Monday around open, I entered into a slightly bullish Iron Condor of 9000 contracts with expiry 5/1 and then jumped on a 4 hour plane trip which was delayed 2 hours without wifi, fingers crossed.

Was now down over 300k yesterday and Schwab flashed a "total lose of 750k" on screen.  I assumed this is normal as their % stuff is shit and nearly always wrong, and I usually just watch account balance. In the middle of the night it showed account balance going from 1.1m to 400k.  I got a tad worried as no calls, no emails no notifications.  Found out at 5am EST that 884 of by 413p I shorted were assigned early, and I was now long 88,400 shares of SPY which I sold at 413 overnight as there was no time value left on the 413p.

Schwab encouraged me to exercise the 409s but I said I would watch GDP first as there may be time value left with the market rising.  Market kept going up, sure enough there was.  Reminder, check time value when exercising.  At open I had to have a broker on the phone for 90min while I slow walked sell orders of shares/puts to not be lopsided in the trade and tried to get benefit of the rising market.  I obviously wanted to keep them as long as possible as my max downside was already hit and I could only go up (assuming they didn't market sell the shares and leave my long puts or exercise for me, killing about 250k in time value).  I hand typed sell orders in lots of 1000-4000 for shares/puts for 90 min with a broker on the phone who was also talking to risk management.  Dude was seriously the most helpful person ever.  The exercise cost me about 300k-600k (who knows exactly with their shitty UI) in additional gains today on top of the 900k since I could not hold them due to not having $17m under my mattress that I could send on a moment notice.  The remaining of gains today was some revenge trading of about 8000 SPY call options at couple strikes which I bought Wednesday night.

As Kostin noted last week: "The seven largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 (Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG), Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA)) account for 28% of the market cap and have contributed 12 pp of the index‚Äôs 19% YTD total return."

[PSEC why now is the time with 20% upside, limited risk COO President bought 80k shares during the 4th quarter!,;,; Happy weekend everybody. I am trying to help the regards that only know NVDA MSFT AAPL TSLA AMD AI AMZN ETC. Put out that helping hand for the gamblers that have been eating red crayons alot!   https://preview.redd.it/gicjys75iegc1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b36291a99c5cf39471ce20caba518585484405ef  Not every company is going to take us to the moon. It is ok to have a company that can pay you a steady 10-12% dividend with some appreciation. In comes Prospect Capital or PSEC. This company has been public since 2004. It is a BDC or business development company. Under the law they must pay 90% of their total profits in the form of dividends. So it is important to note that the company must sustain earnings in order to do that. In the past, many people have worried about a dividend cut at any company, however, PSEC has paid out over 4.1 billion dollars since 2004! Their 6 cents every month, 72 cent per share dividend has been in place for over 5 years! Please check!  Last night I reviewed their most recent earnings report. 11/8/2023 \[They will have one within 2 weeks\] The 10Q official report was 151 pages! I spent roughly 2 hours doing so!  It is a very complicated investment company. They have stakes and investments in over [400 companies].   A regard wants a gold star and its 128 companies.  Over 50% of their sales/income come in the form of high yielding loans. Most of which are at 10-12%. Most smaller companies can not borrow 10-50 or 100 million from a bank.. in turn they seek out private equity or a company like PSEC.. Most of these loans are first line secured, which means PSEC has a stake or can take the assets if a loan goes sour. 2 hours of course is not enough time to review all the companies and a full report‚Ä¶ but 2 hours is enough to tell you the company dividend is in tact!  PSEC fell a lot over the past 2 weeks‚Ä¶ 6.30 to 5.70 because the optimism of a Fed Rate cut has dissipated. Many BDCs go up as rates drop, because investors are attracted to the yield that these can provide if the return on their cash goes down‚Ä¶ Which is why I am posting this now‚Ä¶.  This is an opportunity as the stock sits at 5.84 and even 6.30 is fairly cheap for what you are getting, along with the risk/reward. I can see this going to 6.50 ‚Äì 7.. Which implies close to 20%, with very limited risk to the downside‚Ä¶  The COO/President has purchased 80,000 shares at an average price near 5.85 in November/December, that is near 500K, for someone with a 175K salary and a networth that is below 10 million. The CFO and CFO‚Äôs husband has also purchased shares during the 4th Quarter. The CEO owns nearly 20% of the company at nearly 70 million shares with no salary.   Just providing ideas in case people are worried that the market has come up to far, to fast! Good luck!,;,; 2024-02-03 16:58:01]
[Your lotto play for ETSY's earnings tonight,;,; Etsy (ETSY) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2023 results today, after hours.   For the first quarter of 2023, Etsy anticipates total revenues between $600 million and $640 million. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 48 cents, suggesting a decline of 20% from the prior-year quarter‚Äôs actuals. This figure has increased by 2.1% in the past seven days. To keep things simple, I'm going to put the entire post in jot note form and then provide my conclusion at the end.   **Key Factors to Note**  * Etsy‚Äôs first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from its core business. ETSY‚Äôs core marketplace might have driven its gross merchandise sales.  * The company‚Äôs continuous efforts toward expanding its product offerings to deliver an enhanced customer experience are expected to have contributed well to its top-line growth in the quarter under review.  * Etsy has a strong active buyer base in the United States, Germany, and the U.K.   * This is likely to have continued to support the soon-to-be-reported quarter‚Äôs performance.   * The company‚Äôs progress in its newest core market, India, is also expected to have been a positive.  * Increasing consumer demand for services and household supplies like groceries is expected to have impacted Etsy‚Äôs top line in the first quarter.  * Rising investment in core Etsy and subsidiaries, such as Reverb, Depop and Elo7, are anticipated to get reflected in the to-be-reported results.  * The expanding global footprint of Etsy Payments and the strong momentum across Etsy Ads and Offsite Ads are likely to have been the other positives in the quarter under discussion.  * Additionally, continuous efforts to increase brand awareness are likely to get reflected in the to-be-reported quarter‚Äôs results.  * Further, increasing investments in marketing to acquire buyers and retain the existing ones are anticipated to have remained tailwinds.  * Moreover, Etsy‚Äôs go-to-market strategy, recommendation features, better shipping options, conversion rate optimization, online search and checkout process optimization and expanding app usage are likely to have proved beneficial.  * However, the impact of global supply-chain constraints, sluggish consumer discretionary spending and macroeconomic uncertainties might get reflected in the upcoming quarterly results.  * Intensifying competition in the e-commerce market is expected to have remained a concern for Etsy‚Äôs market position in the to-be-reported quarter.  I think the "good" news outweighs the "bad" news in this case. Notice EBAY (a very similar ecommerce website) did very well with earnings. I'm gonna grab a call spread, buying the ETSY 5/5 105c @ 3.65 and selling the 110c @ 2.37. This means I can grab the spread for $128 for a potential of 3.9x gains if the stock climbs ~9%.,;,; 2023-05-03 17:08:00]

[ABNB Earnings Alert: Everything you need to know üöÄüî•,;,; Listen up, degens! Yesterday [I gave you AMD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17kq09i/amd_earnings_time_to_hit_it_big/) and the stock is up 8% today. Calls printed, big time. Last week, I told you to get [AMZN calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17h0sy7/amazon_earnings_the_boomer_play_that_could_print/) and those did very well. Well now, ABNB is about to drop its 3Q 2023 earnings after the bell today. The company expected to see some good post-rona gains in  the travel industry, with the accommodation platform expected to report increased revenues and profits. Again.   The company's forecast shows us they‚Äôre eyeing between $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion in revenue, marking a yoy growth from 14% to 18% compared to $2.9 billion last year. Wall Street suits are guesstimating revenue smack in the middle at $3.36 billion, with an EPS increase of 16.2% to $2.08 from last year's $1.79.  The company expects to report a small-ish uptick in their Nights and Experiences (nights) booked from the second quarter‚Äôs 115.1 million. hey're also projecting a record-smashing 3Q adjusted EBITDA (that's basically their earnings before the suits take out taxes and other boring stuff), which was a sweet $1.5 billion last year. They're also hoping to improve on their EBITDA margin of 51% from 2022.  Third-party data suggests strong 3Q bookings.  Analysts at the Bank of America (BoA)‚Äîwho've always got something to say‚Äîare sending mixed signals on the online travel sector. But let's be real, the data from AirDNA suggests Airbnb's 3Q booking growth is solid. They're anticipating around 114 million nights booked and total bookings upped to $18.2 billion. Especially in the Asia-Pacific region, the Nights and Experiences should be popping off.  Factors like average daily rates going up, driven by foreign exchange, mix shift of larger homes, and geographic mix, is expected to have impacted the to-be-reported quarterly performance. Moreover, strength across Cross-border nights booked, owing to increasing international travel demand, is likely to have aided Airbnb‚Äôs performance in the to-be-reported quarter.  Regulatory drama in New York has been a hot topic, so expect Airbnb‚Äôs management to focus on long-term bookings on the platform.   * ‚ÄúCEO Brian Chesky has suggested new long-term rental initiatives will be announced as part of Airbnb‚Äôs winter product update,‚Äù they wrote in a note to clients.  Keep an eye out for other gems in the earnings call, like insights into their long-term rental game plan and other potential moonshots like sponsored listings, which could hype up growth rates for 2024.  Additionally, increasing travel demand, growing awareness around hosting, and introducing new tools for hosts are likely to have resulted in strong supply growth across all regions and market types in the quarter under review. Also, strong momentum in new active listings, driven by reduced fees for longer stays and monthly discounts, is likely to have been another positive.  All these factors are expected to have driven growth in gross booking value (GBV) in the third quarter. I think we're in for a potentially epic earnings here, that can send ABNB to the moon. üöÄüåï I'm gonna grab a ABNB 11/03 122c @ 2.91 each. You could also opt for a call spread, buying the 120c at 3.90 and selling the 125c at 2.03. This means you can grab the spread for 187 bucks, with a capped potential gain of 2.7x. Keep in mind, this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. Tomorrow we have AAPL, SQ, DKNG, COIN, and CVNA so keep your eyes peeled!,;,; 2023-11-01 18:44:08]
[Short SPY and buy RSP,;,; TLDR - Short SPY (weighted S&amp;P500) and buy RSP (equal weight S&amp;P500) to make bank on the rotation out of the magnificent 7 into the rest of the S&amp;P500.  https://preview.redd.it/llrngept2y1c1.png?width=1777&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec173ef24a811709beb1aae9a4995af1f988cea9  https://preview.redd.it/81s2bhpt2y1c1.png?width=1778&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30d5cf603c406d7953820dee822f49048465c6aa  I think we can all agree that a rotation out of the magnificent 7 is coming. As people invest into boomer stocks with dividends and P/Es below 50, the question arises: "how do we use to opportunity to make the stonk market give us free money?"  My answer is "pair trading". I realize that utilizing a sophisticated trading strategy I heard about earlier today and then going to WSB for feedback is a recipe for me sucking off your wife's boyfriend behind a Wendy's dumpster by the end of the week but, here goes.   The concentration and lack of diversity in SPY has been increasing and particularly so for the last year and these handful of stocks have carried the market to near all time highs. This must run out of steam at some point as some the charts are looking exhausted on the back of such a moon-shot. For reference, since Jan 1st:  * AAPL +54.26% * MSFT +61.23% * GOOG +54.07% * TSLA +133.18% * NVDA +250.25% * META +192.10% * AMZN +78.27% * SPY +20.60% * RSP +4.92%  Yes they were undervalued at the start of the year but the divergence is now massive between these stocks and the rest of the market. I posit that one of two things will happen:  1. The bull market takes hold and we head to new all time highs with investment coming out of the magnificent 7 as profits are booked and flowing into the rest of the market leading to a closing of the SPY-RSP spread. 2. We enter a recession at some point next year and safety is sought in defensive stocks as funds move from the magnificent 7 into utilities, healthcare etc. which will narrow the SPY-RSP spread.  If there were a trade that would profit from either scenario it literally cannot go tits up. This is where pair trading comes in: we short the SPY and buy the RSP based on the thesis that this spread will close. By going long and short we are not gay bears betting against America and we should be able achieve Bill Hwang levels of leverage without being margin called as the one position hedges the other (famous last words).   This is a low risk trade and may not satisfy the risk appetite of WSB regulars but I'm looking to enter the position in the next week or so with an equal weighted approach (same amount in each instrument and same amount short and long). I think around 25% of my account should suffice for the moment.  Keep it real bitches.,;,; 2023-11-22 18:44:55]
[UVIX Play: Go Balls Deep &amp; Make Money,;,; Dear my fellow WallStreetBets brethen,  I am writing to provide you with a well regarded due diligence report on why going long on UVIX NOW could result in u making hella tendies on Wednesday. I‚Äôm so confident on this play, I‚Äôm willing to take a one week ban if UVIX doesn‚Äôt spike from its current price after FOMC ($10.21 at this time of writing).  First and foremost, it is important to understand what UVIX is and how it operates. UVIX is an exchange-traded note (ETN) that tracks the performance of the S&amp;P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index. The VIX, also known as the "fear index," is a measure of the stock market's volatility and is used by investors to gauge the level of fear or stress in the market.   The market has been soaring ever since FB and AMZN earnings, which is understandable. But UVIX being a volatility gauge, being at all time lows before such a week [filled with important events‚Ä¶](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-decision-apple-earnings-april-jobs-report-what-to-know-this-week-144601325.html)We already how FOMC = a bunch of pressure on the markets.  A 25bps increase would push the Fed interest rate to levels not seen since 2007.  It is worth noting that UVIX is a leveraged ETN, which means that its price movements are magnified compared to the underlying index. This means even though you‚Äôll be purchasing shares (which I recommend, only because IV on the call options are high), you‚Äôll still make nice tendies. It‚Äôs down over 7% today and it‚Äôs near all time lows (currently at $10.21). This presents a juicy opportunity to get in at the lows, before a massive catalytic event. This literally can‚Äôt go tits up.   *As with any investment, it is important to do your own research and assess your personal risk tolerance (as did the wise ControltheNarrative did) before making a decision. Just kidding, go as balls deep as you can on SHARES and rejoice by the end of this week.   TLDR: GO LONG UVIX RN  Best regards, -A WSB Elder  Edit: currently up to $10.77 , up around 5.2% on shares in less than 3 hoursüòÇ  Edit 2: UVIX up 22% today, currently trading at 13.01; I recommend taking profits at these levels but of course it‚Äôs up to you.,;,; 2023-05-01 16:50:09]

All short positions should be opened during premarket tomorrow before market open.  The abnormal increase in the stock price is usually a result of market makers receiving and pricing in knowledge that Chinese regulators may soon come out with new regulations on investments abroad.  This shouldn't come as a surprise, given how Chinese regulators have historical precedence of announcing new regulations following major/surprise rulings from British Regulators on investments abroad. Some Hong Kong based futures brokerage platforms may post new developments on securities regulations ahead of an official announcement from Chinese regulators.

[Am I Regarded?,;,; I‚Äôm looking to expand on my thoughts and would like some perspective on something to see if I‚Äôm living inside an echo chamber.   Lately I‚Äôve had a paradigm shift with regards to streaming platforms and their over saturation of the market. I have noticed that a good portion of platforms have begun making announcements about releasing some of their content for theatrical release(Amazon‚Äôs most recent ‚ÄúAir‚Äù), I would assume this is an attempt to attract new subscribers to their respective platforms. Even with the theatrical release I‚Äôm under the impression that there is only really enough room for about 3 platforms. Now even if the major players I‚Äôm the streaming market (I‚Äôm think Amazon, Netflix, and Disney) buyout all the other platforms which I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs possible, won‚Äôt they have to continue with the theatrical release pathway to obtaining new subscribers, how else does someone who‚Äôs not already a subscriber find their new content?   Now I‚Äôm a Canadian and I‚Äôm currently only looking at Canadian investments and company‚Äôs because of the awful exchange rate of our Monopoly money, but with this line of thinking about the streaming platforms, is it reasonable to think that Cineplex (CGX) would be a large beneficiary of this new method to attract subscribers given their massive market share of Canada?   The paradigm shift was during the early and later stages of the pandemic I believed that theatres would go the way of the dodo bird. I even went to see a movie I had no interest in seeing because I believed that with the pressure on them from streamers that a complete shutdown was the final nail for them. Now we‚Äôre on the other side of all the lockdowns and streaming platforms seem to be wanting to foster a symbiotic relationship with the theatre companies,  I would imagine that this would be extremely beneficial for companies such as Cineplex. If my thinking makes sense would now be a good time to do a deep dive into all the theatre related business and determine which one or two stand to be the biggest gainers from this transition?,;,; 2023-04-21 03:30:23]

[Nvidia chases $30 billion custom chip market with new unit,;,; Nvidia NVDA  is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for  cloud computing firms and others, including advanced artificial  intelligence processors, according to nine sources familiar with the  company's plans.  The dominant global designer and  supplier of AI chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market  for custom AI chips and to protect itself from the growing number of  companies interested in finding alternatives to its products.  The  Santa Clara, California-based company currently controls about 80% of  the market for high-end AI chips, a position that has sent its market  value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than  tripled in 2023.  Its customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOG and Meta Platforms META, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of Nvidia chips to compete in the rapidly emerging generative AI sector.  Nvidia's  H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor  for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started  to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps  reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time  to design.  Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in  helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to  rival firms such as Broadcom AVGO and Marvell Technology MRVL, according to the sources who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  "If  you're really trying to optimize on things like power, or optimize on  cost for your application, you can't afford to go drop an H100 or A100  in there," Greg Reichow, general partner at venture capital firm Eclipse  Ventures said in an interview. "You want to have the exact right  mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need."  Nvidia does not disclose H100 prices, which are higher than for the  prior-generation A100, but each chip can sell from $16,000 to $100,000  depending on the volume purchased and other factors. Meta has said it  plans to bring its total stock to 350,000 H100s this year.  Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon .com AMZN,  Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for  them, according to two sources familiar with the meetings. Beyond data  center chips, the company has pursued telecom, automotive and video game  customers.  In 2022, Nvidia said it would let  third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking  technology with their own chips. The company has said nothing about the  program since, and Reuters is reporting its wider ambitions for the  first time.  A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company's 2022 announcement.  Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices AMD  and Marvell executive, heads Nvidia's custom unit and her team's goal  is to make its technology available for customers in cloud, 5G wireless,  video games and automotives, according to a LinkedIn profile. Those  mentions were scrubbed and her title was changed after Reuters sought  comment from Nvidia.  Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment.  $30 BILLION MARKET  According  to estimates from research firm 650 Group‚Äôs Alan Weckel, the data  center custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year,  and double that in 2025.  The broader custom chip market  was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023, which amounts to roughly 5% of  annual global chip sales, according to Needham analyst Charles Shi.  Currently, custom silicon design for data centers is dominated by Broadcom and Marvell.  In  a typical arrangement, a design partner such as Nvidia would offer  intellectual property and technology, but leave the chip fabrication,  packaging and additional steps to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  2330 or another contract chip manufacturer.  Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales.  "With  Broadcom's custom silicon business touching $10 billion, and Marvell‚Äôs  around $2 billion, this is a real threat," said Dylan Patel, founder of  the silicon research group SemiAnalysis. "It's a real big negative -  there's more competition entering the fray."  BEYOND AI  Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson 61QS  for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics  processing unit (GPU) technology, according to two sources familiar with  the talks.  650 Group's Weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year.  Ericsson declined to comment.  Nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video game markets, according to sources and public social media postings.  Weckel  expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6  billion to $8 billion range at 20% a year, and the $7 billion to $8  billion video game custom chip market could increase with the  next-generation consoles from Xbox and Sony 6857.  Nintendo‚Äôs  current Switch handheld console already includes an Nvidia chip, the  Tegra X1. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is  likely to include a Nvidia custom design, according to one source.  Nintendo declined to comment.  &amp;#x200B;  \- Reuters,;,; 2024-02-09 13:25:56]
[Amazon Earnings: The Boomer Play that Could Print üöÄüí∞,;,; Alright, buckle up degenerates, here comes Amazon's earnings rollercoaster. Is this the meme stock of the month?

Let's break it down. üöÄ Amazon is set to report earnings today, the company's had massive earnings growth this year, beating EPS estimates by 44% and 89% in the last two quarters, respectively. Today, the quarterly earnings are expected to come in at an EPS of $0.60 on $141.5 billion in revenue. $127.1 billion the previous year.  Jeff Bezos might've shot himself into space, but his money-making behemoth stays grounded on Earth. The company is doing well with amazon shares are up 42% this year, topping the Nasdaq‚Äôs 23% gain. So, the big question: YOLO some calls for earnings or nah? After Amazon‚Äôs growth slowed dramatically last year due to rising inflation and economic concerns, expansion has ticked up a bit in 2022, though it‚Äôs still weaker than usual for the company. Amazon‚Äôs retail business is expected to show some improvement from consumers tepidly resuming discretionary spending.   Analysts are expecting growth of 11% in the third quarter, marking a slight acceleration from the past couple quarters. E-commerce sales boomed during the pandemic, then slowed as shoppers returned to physical stores. I'll be focused on the results of Amazon's Prime Big Deals Days event, as well as guidance for consumer spending during the holidays.  **Cloud Computing**  Being the world's largest cloud provider and a significant profit driver for amazon (nearly 70%), all eyes will be on Amazon Web Services (AWS).   Amazon‚Äôs cloud computing business is a concern for a lot of people in wall street, as growth in AWS has been slowing in recent quarters. Google just reported earnings and one of its misses was in the cloud revenue department‚Äîcould this mean that AWS is taking more of the lion's share. However, you'd think the frenzy around generative artificial intelligence is leading to bigger workloads in the cloud, which should be a boon for AWS and its rival public cloud vendors. Looking at Microsoft (MSFT), sales in their Azure cloud unit grew 29%, faster than the 26% expected by analysts. This is considered bitter sweet as this could be eating into AWS' market share.   I expect stable AWS revenue, but want to know more about higher energy costs and rising competition. They currently hold a 40% share of the cloud services market last year, compared to Microsoft's 21.5% and Google's 7.5%.  **Ads**  Let's talk ads. Amazon's ad sales are right up there with Alphabet (GOOG) and Meta (META), so it will be interesting to see how it fared this quarter. One of Amazon's fastest-growing business sectors. Alphabet beat ad-sales estimates by almost $1 billion this quarter and Amazon will look to report similar success.  **AI**  Microsoft has OpenAI, we all know this. Amazon wanted in on the AI space and and in Sept announcing a deal to invest up to $4 billion in OpenAI competitor Anthropic. Additionally, in April, Amazon launched Amazon Bedrock, a service that allows users of Amazon's AWS to create generative AI applications. During the earnings call, I'm interested in hearing if there are any gains from its AI efforts. As mentioned earlier, the rise in AI causes more people to use cloud computing services like AWS.   **What do the experts say?**  BofA Global Research analyst Justin Post mentioned stuff that I've already written up here in a research note, stating that AWS is the Street‚Äôs top focus area, with some third-party sources suggesting that demand has decelerated. He's specifically betting on 12.5% growth for AWS, but cautions that a number in the 11% range would likely trigger selling. But further ads that a number above 13% would likely spur the stock higher.  On top of this, Post says aggregated credit and debit card data suggests online spending rose 1% from a year ago in the quarter, a two point acceleration from the June quarter. And he notes that ‚Äúad spending checks were also constructive.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe see retail upside potential driven by logistics efficiency, ads, fee increases, and easing comps,‚Äù Post writes ‚Äúwhile we think AWS can accelerate in Q4 with more acceleration in Q1 2024 on an easing optimization cycle and incremental AI demand.‚Äù Post keeps his Buy rating and $174 target price on the stock. Mind you, the stock is literally at $118 right now.   **What to do for earnings**  My magic 8-ball says both revenue and EPS could outpace the estimates. Alright Degens, here's the play: I'm grabbing some AMZN 10/27 125c @ 2.04 each.  If Amazon rockets just 7%, those calls are hitting pay dirt. üöÄ  Get your war paint on, it‚Äôs earnings season. üé∞üî•,;,; 2023-10-26 16:45:48]
[Market Recap 4/21/23 - The Recession is Cancelled,;,; Friday 4/21/23  Me this week:  https://preview.redd.it/gcijqhyl2bva1.jpg?width=984&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=966596b08ca0331edf314d7ea73a9c496954872e  https://preview.redd.it/q9cmjnmo2bva1.jpg?width=500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8109ff01dea9ade380efd266dcbda6fa02275867  https://i.redd.it/lxatfu9p2bva1.gif  https://i.redd.it/j7den0gz3bva1.gif  **The Fed**  The Fed needs to raise more, a lot more, at this moment, right now! 2023 US tax revenue is trending down about \~30% compared to 2022, but the US deficit is expected to exceed 2 trillion this year. Here is what‚Äôs bothering me: with the US government on a spending spree, how is the Fed supposed to tighten? The Fed is on schedule to shrink their balance sheet by 60 billion per month, which is less than 1 trillion a year. However, the US government is basically injecting 2 trillion a year into the system. I don‚Äôt see how liquidity can ever go down.  https://preview.redd.it/foiz1q4d4bva1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fd849327f59cfce4f4ec046d494fd04ef10adae  Just a reminder that the Fed is only expecting 1% GDP growth this year and a 4.5% unemployment rate. So far, we are tracking 2% GDP growth and a 3.5% unemployment rate. The Fed is very far from done.  https://preview.redd.it/b2xx462e4bva1.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0ab448d621d9763e5bb2bb5398e68642c08ffce2  **The Economy**  This week‚Äôs economic data is confusing, to say the least. We got Empire State roaring higher on Monday, then Philly Fed face-slapping bad, and conference board LEI puking yesterday. But how can you end the week without another jumping surprise from SP Global flash PMI? Today‚Äôs data showed both manufacturing (11-month high) and service (6-month high) jumped to expansion territory. New orders are at an 11-month high, job growth is solid, and prices are higher too. JPMorgan said, ‚ÄúThe April flash PMI showed unexpected and broad-based improvement, suggesting further positive momentum in the US economy, a more sustained pace of expansion, and tighter monetary and credit conditions do not appear to be significantly slowing activity at this time.‚Äù  https://preview.redd.it/tt0x627j4bva1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d36d6e1be6186ba882684281284c9b546bde6387  So I was trying to find out why consumers and businesses are so resilient in a tightening environment. And look what I found:   ***Savings, so much savings.***   US household savings are still sitting at a historical high. And not just a little high, but 4X high! From 1 trillion before the pandemic to close to 5 trillion today.  You mfs keeps whining about inflation but look at how much cash you are hoarding!  https://preview.redd.it/qa4z1w1q4bva1.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae6fff2e5bb73e8cd1266ee3ef2cc26c3c2fc9a9  Even though the saving rate is down from 10% before COVID to 5% now, the absolute dollar amount is still higher than before COVID!   https://preview.redd.it/lny8y60u4bva1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fb57022375ea060a4374b533ae8c6100a1b22a6  Corporate, on the other hand, has a cash position declining much faster, but still higher than before the pandemic.  https://preview.redd.it/6fsh3p3h5bva1.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18572b9c88fafeb8cddfe295f3a9d4c5df5e6a28  The interest coverage ratio (calculated by dividing earnings before interest and tax by the cost of a company's debt-interest payments) is declining rapidly but still higher than before the pandemic. However, the debt-to-equity ratio is declining too, indicating that US companies are deleveraging (taking less risk).  https://preview.redd.it/e7nasw5p5bva1.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb17aaa3040b7d8bb38fd6238e8f5de13c0adc79  Looks like it‚Äôs going to take the Fed a lot more rate hikes for a much longer time to bring inflation down.  &amp;#x200B;  **The Business**  MSFT, META, AMZN will report next week.   "With tech ownership super concentrated, results to come in these stocks are critical if this equity market is to hold. MSFT and NOW next week will be huge tests in my view. They do not have to be big beats or raises, they need to be clean and stable." - JPM  Big techs are last year's biggest losers who turned out to be this year's biggest winners. Funds are looking for stability and safety. It‚Äôs not that the market is overlooking risks, but rather that all the risks are priced into small caps.  https://preview.redd.it/p879h43y5bva1.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ec851183f5486a7c6b24c2ab5d68d6e5e0ebe20  https://preview.redd.it/60jy5j7z5bva1.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35c9e45feec96014e233b59bc2e00b33dc5b759f  So far, 76% of $SPX companies have beaten EPS estimates to date for Q1, which is below the 5-year average of 77%, but above the 10-year average of 73%.  https://preview.redd.it/gqdupgt06bva1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57b044cdb0b9690e438c8c9e470dc09314372450  I will do a weekly recap over the weekend, focusing on earnings and yield, and update my year-end target model.

[Last Two Days Explained: Bears Lose,;,; It has been quite some time since I have posted here, lets see how shitty it still is.   Yesterday bears were winning, they had had strung together 5-6 days in a row after Powell said "no. no. no I wouldn't say that" in response to a Reuters reporter asking "is a soft landing your base case?"      Then the SEP (I know many don't know or track this) shows in his fancy power point slides that we should be at 5% all of 2024 - ouch. Higher for longer represented officially for the first time - much higher for longer than the market had expected. Specifically the market was thinking "the fed MUST be done soon, remember Aug 17th when bad news = good news and we rallied off the recent low? Our economy is shit, unemployment is going higher, GDP is slowing, so that means FED cuts are coming!" and the bulls piled in. Everyone like Tom Lee saying "new highs by end of the year!"      Well that lasted only so long, and Powell all but killed the bulls after his recent FOMC speech and his quite "hawkish pause" locking in expectations for higher for longer.      Since then, 10YR and 30YR have been ripping. Oil has been ripping. Dollar has been ripping. JPY/USD had been falling. China has been Falling.      \^\^ this is all super bearish.      So what do professionals and even retail do? They go short. They buy puts. They sell calls. Funds unwind their long leverage... and... markets sell off.      On Wednesday the trend continues down, right to about to levels where we bounced on Aug 17th. Around 2pm EST Zuck takes the stage at his shit conference. The man doubles down on Quest, AR, VR, Metaverse style ideas and the market hates it... META drops about 3% in 30 minutes. Keep in mind, Quest sales have been declining and that META's hardware department loses 17B of its 35B in operating profit. So... META makes 35B each year lets say, and they throw 17B at hardware/metaverse/AR/Glasses/Goggles/Joysticks and legless avatars.      The man is on stage talking about how we can all use MSFT products in our work meetings in the AR Metaverse. Yawn.      Market hates it.      Real quick tho - can you imagine seeing a human being in those Ray Ban glasses with a fucking camera pointed at you? Walking around in public somewhere livestreaming their worthless lives? Maybe its just me but who has the balls to do that? Is it even legal in most places - and regardless one MAGA guy is going to yank them off your face and destroy them. Doesn't that just self identify you as a follower of Zuckerberg - or a Facebook boomer? God I just personally hate the whole thing.      Moving on.      Zuck then quickly moves on and starts saying the magic word: AI.      Keep in mind, the market is now down about .8% at this point and META is down 3.5%. All the bears, across all tech, are basically now seeing the market hit those levels and they have a lot of gains. Puts get closed, shorts get covered. That leads to buying...      Simultaneously Zuck says AI 5 more times and... retail starts buying, or closing shorts, or both - who cares. But a bottom forms and the squeeze is on. Zuck mentions MSFT, AMZN and NVDA over the course of 15 minutes and the magnificent 7 just start rallying and squeezing higher and higher. Week hands get liquidated, others cover their shorts before its too late and SPY/QQQ print a vertical green line for about 1.5 hours straight. Pretty cool for the bulls, total shit for the bears.      Now the sentiment is shifting a bit... fintwit and reddit and the BTFD crowd say in unison "told you, stonks only go up!" And confidence builds. The rally continues - a nice one actually.      Overnight futures drift higher and everything seems well until... more bad news... Government revises GDP and consumer spending numbers. GDP is reduced an consumer spending is reduced.      Economy worse, people spending less. SUPER BULLISH remember? Bad news is good news because it means the FED is done right? It's getting what it wants, the economy is slowing and people are broke again. YES! BUY BUY BUY      So in the AM the markets find their bottom on this report as soon as the market opens and dumbasses can trade options again. Puts get closed, calls get bought, VIX gets crushed. BULLISH! The rally continues cause bad news = good news.      And that brings us to the PCE report tomorrow AM. Well... if GOV reduced consumer spending lower that means, most likely, consumer spending will come in lower again tomorrow in the report. People are spending even less! Awesome! BULLISH!      People front run it, getting calls in expectation that PCE comes in "cooler" tomorrow - which it probably will. If PCE comes in cool tomorrow, expect another "August 17th style bounce" and the bulls to be in control again for a while.   Thats all I got.      &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-09-28 22:23:35]

[Let's have an intelligent discussion about $HOOD,;,; Let me present my bull case.Let's have an intelligent discussion. If someone is willing to bite and give a well-thought bear case, please don't downvote them.  1. Worldwide expansions. UK expansion coming up, they will then expand into every country with lower consumer-protection laws. Consumers will pressure Canada/Australia/Europe governments to write Robinhood friendly laws. Their userbase could 10x off of simply launching into other countries. Only politics stand in their way. Edit : Remember how Uber just forced their way into every country, despite taxi laws? Governments are weak. Tech startups with deep pockets can just bully them. 2. Innovation : They're the only ones innovating. Why is nobody else offering commission-free options? 24h trading? Seemless transfer between your investing and checking accounts? Between your stocks and crypto? And I won't mention everything they did first that everyone else had to catch up to. I'm canadian and it took me 5 business days to transfer CAD, exchange it to USD, have it settle (2 business days for money to settle? WTF is this 1990?), just so I could buy some share last week. Why is that? Cause the entire banking industry is rotten. They've been too big to fail and sitting on their asses for more than a century. Their codebases are from the 1970s. They have layers upon layers of utterly useless middle management. They're in panic mode right now and have no clue how to do anything. Starting from the CEO, you'd have to go down 10-15 layers of crippling middle management before you finally get to someone actually doing anything productive. They're being disrupted big time. 3. Retirement, loans, financial advice, mortgages : Robinhood started with brokering stocks and options, expanded into crypto, and if you listened to their last earnings call, they plan to expand into every financial service that banks are offering.  Why would anyone ever give another penny to a financial advisor who knows jack shit about the future and takes 2% of your entire net worth every year and pockets it. In 25 years, he'll have half your money. Mortgage brokers, stock brokers(already done), financial advisors, etc... All of these jobs will be made redundant by Robinhood. Every service offered by a bank will be offered by Robinhood but better and cheaper. 4. Macroeconomics : Rates are higher than ever. People have less money to invest than ever, and yet, Robinhood is still crawling upwards in monthly active users, assets under custody, active accounts, all the good metrics. These metrics will go parabolic when rates go down, S&amp;P reaches new heights, FOMO creeps in and people flock en masse to Robinhood. Proof? There are thousands of lurkers reading this right now who didn't give a shit about 8$ Robinhood, and are now considering buying at 12.50$. 5. Imponderables : Sorry for the big word regards. Covid comeback? Government handouts? Meme stock season? Crypto season? Something you and I can't even fathom? Every unpredictable event that could happen at anytime can send Robinhood to the stratosphere. The last time the government gave 2000$ to everyone they gambled it all away on Gamestop and AMC of all things. They literally created a cult with a prophet and a judah. History repeats itself. Humans are predictable. Next time will be another stock, another coin, another cult. Which one? I have no clue. What will be worth 60$+ just like last time? Robinhood.  What's the limit? A lot of people bought Tesla at $10B valuation and sold at $30B. "Holy shit, we're worth half as much as GM, Ford, Toyota. Must be time to sell". Shit's worth $900B now. As much as the next 10 competitors combined. You can't compare $TSLA with car stocks. You can't compare $AMZN with retail stocks. You can't compare $HOOD with bank stocks. They're tech stocks.  My bull case target : 2172$/share. That's the total market cap of the 10 biggest banks combined. Or about 2/3 as much as apple. Call me crazy.  Positions : 33 leaps 15$ 02/2024 Bought them a while ago they're deep in the red.. 6200 shares, avg @ 9.80.

[Went long QQQ calls today. I feel very dirty.,;,; I had to hold my nose and buy some QQQ calls.  The world cental banks injected $1 Trillion in liquidity and if I have learned something over the decades of trading, do not fight the Fed.  While I am confidant that the world is not saved, as is evident from my CRE post, I also remember 2008 when Bear Stearns went belly up in March but it took the summer and part of the Fall until Lehman went under.  Of course, the DOJ also sued two of Bear's hedge funds in August so that helped.  The chance of the DOJ suing any investment bank or bank this time around is 1%.  I mean, they just backstopped them, again.  **Other contributing factors to my QQQ long position:**  1. Hedge Funds and CTA's are still overwhelmingly bearish according to multiple reports from Government Sachs, the devil (JPM) and others. 2. QQQ is in a technical bull market now.  I don't argue with charts. 3. There's still that $1 trillion I mentioned up above that is supposed to stabilize deposit bases.  And after 2008 the largest banks who received their bailouts, promised to lend that money out.  They didn't - they put it in risk assets - stocks.  But sure, this time they will do as they say. 4. Hedgies are short overwhelmingly, to the tune of $28 billion SPX futures that they need to cover in April. 5. Seasonality as shown by the attached graphic. 6. Perfect conditions for a short squeeze on the NDX which is nowhere near overbought.  **HOWEVER, there are just as many worrisome data points:**  1. Since Dec 28, 50% of the gain in NDX has been from 5 stocks NVDA, AAPL, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA META.  Sorry, that's very.  See #2 2. From the graphic, earnings are now expected to drop 12% yoy from last year.  Not good if you are a fundamental investor. 3. There WILL be more bad news from the banking sector.  Might be a private HF or private REIT, but this is a no brainer. 4. The Fed apparently only really wanted to get the market through the end of this quarter bc how much news have you heard from them about regulatory enforcement?  NONE.  Why? Because if they hadn't, can you freaking imagine what some of these large banks would be reporting. 5. EOQ is the time for mutual funds and all to "paint the tape."  They sell the stocks that have rec'd bad press (banks) and buy the stocks that have rec'd good press (NVDA et al.)  Translation: HF chasing over the last 3 weeks has led to the NDX advance which has held the SPX up. 6. If the tech sector is so hot, then why have so many LARGE layoffs been announced?  And the layoffs are broad: META  -11,000; GOOGL - 12,0000; AMZN-distribution labor - 9000; Indeed - 2200 - uhm, job search site, WMT-layoffs from warehouse to distribution.  And then the one I think is hilarious are the 1400 from McKinsey and Co -who are usually the ones doing the layoffs.  BTW, perhaps the easiest metric to use to know if the NDX run is over?  AAPL.  Pull up a chart.  Lately its been leading the market.  Finally, despite being "forced" into a long QQQ position, I also put on a long VIX position today.  I mean, cmon - look at the daily chart.  I hate it, I think its a joke, but I will not fight the Fed.  I hope the market elevates so I can get short at higher levels. I remain short CMBS, COIN, and CLX.  Long VIX and other "story" plays.

[Amazon‚Äôs cloud business is clamping down on managers‚Äô freedom to hire in latest cost control.,;,; Amazon‚Äôs cloud business is introducing new restrictions that limit managers' ability to hire, the latest move by the internet company to keep its costs in check as sales growth slows to the lowest level in years.  In a memo sent to Amazon Web Services (AWS) hiring managers on Tuesday, the company said that all potential hires must now be filtered through a special headcount management system to ensure that they are matched with a specific open position. The in-house tool, called Roster, will act as "the source of truth for approved headcount plans," according to the memo, which was viewed by *Fortune*.  AWS managers must begin using Roster immediately, the memo said. By the end of the month, the memo continued, new features will be enabled in a separate internal recruiting tool "to prevent offers from being extended if a requisition is not matched to a position in Roster."  The changes come as AWS and parent company Amazon move aggressively to cut costs. After sweeping layoffs at the online retailer that affected 18,000 corporate positions over the last several months, Amazon announced another 9,000 job cuts in March, which impacted its prized cloud division. Now, six months after a hiring freeze was instituted and experiencing a decline in sales growth that caused the stock to dip 2% last week, the company is working on controls that create a more disciplined hiring system.  ‚ÄúLike most companies, Amazon makes regular process improvements over time to meet the needs of their customers," Amazon spokesperson Jennifer Flagg wrote to *Fortune*. "Roster is a position based management tool that improves the hiring process across the organization for both candidates and hiring managers.‚Äù  Roster is being deployed by AWS's Workforce Management, the memo said, and is part of a plan to ensure that "all hiring efforts and resourcing aligns to approved business demands by EOY 2023."

In Amazon's Q1 earnings call last week, CEO Andy Jassy hyped up the possible impact A.I. would have on the cloud division. At the dismay of shareholders, executives added that AWS so far in April¬†is on track to grow 11%, a significant decline from the approximately 16% growth seen in the first quarter, which itself was a marked slowdown from the 37% growth that AWS achieved at the same time last year.

[Market Recap - 4/27/23 - I'm losing my pants,;,; **The Fed**  1Q23 GDP grew by 1.1% (q/q ann.), lower than the estimated 1.9% and the 2.6% in the previous quarter. This is the slowest growth since 2Q2022, which was a negative quarter. The data was strong, with consumer spending being the highlight, and government spending also increased significantly. Investment continues to decline but slowed down from the previous quarter. Overall, the growth is pretty solid, but not surprising, considering the consensus estimation was 2%.  https://preview.redd.it/39z1lzm3whwa1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c44f76c38ea7f8a4feafe6e83fa042ce9a2cc2a5  The job market is still very tight, with initial jobless claims at 230k, lower than the estimated 248k and the previous week's 246k. Continuing claims were at 1.858M, also lower than the estimated 1.87M and the previous week's 1.861M. The data supports the "higher for longer" narrative, but the stock market seems to be ignoring it.  https://preview.redd.it/icamrmb5whwa1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e2580d7007456db65f11a9467aae85671234e01  The bond market has started pricing in more rate hikes and fewer cuts, with hikes in June and July back on the table.

[Getting strong AMD vibes from SPCE,;,; Anyone remember AMD back in 2012-2015? I remember buying in when it was about $3 (a whole $50 at the time) and following it as earnings came in and the company was on a positive track but the stock kept going down. The upsides with Crypto, Machine Learning, and other processing power heavy technologies just around the corner yet the stock continued to be barely hanging on to life, then  suddenly the stock took off as it began to show the earnings reported weren't temporary but long-term strategic growths.  &amp;#x200B;  Right now I'm looking at SPCE with similar vibes, here's why.  Just a few years ago Space Tourism was predicted to be a growing and potential multi-billion dollar per year industry.  Here's some charts because we all like pictures.  https://preview.redd.it/2i7wr1a1z82b1.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=679365ac2cb3e72a57686b9ca1a3ca1dc6f74436  https://preview.redd.it/xn0d0p42z82b1.png?width=2172&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f47c70490f6a8526b0d29c62b044048519ef109f  But why SPCE? Why not AMZN or SpaceX?  It all comes down to: Affordability, Availability, and Astronaut-ability.  # Affordability:  * Virgin Galactic Ticket Price: **$450,000** (Target market: Millionaires) * Blue Origin Ticket Price: **$1,250,000** (Target market: Multi-millionaires) * SpaceX Ticket Price: **$55,000,000** (Target market: Governments &amp; Billionaires)  # Availability:  * Virgin Galactic Yearly Capacity: 400 Flights (planned) / 2,400 Persons * Blue Origin Yearly Capacity: 52 Flights (estimate) / 312 Persons * SpaceX Yearly Capacity: 61 Flights (proven) / 427 Persons  # Astronaut-ability:  * Virgin Galactic flights qualify for the commercial astronaut recognition by the FAA * Blue Origin flights qualify for the commercial astronaut recognition by the FAA * SpaceX flights qualify for the commercial astronaut recognition by the FAA  That's right, they all qualify! The FUD over the K√°rm√°n line is pure marketing by Blue Origin and SpaceX as well as SPCE bears. The FAA recognizes commercial astronauts (tourists) **who fly to a height of 50 miles or higher.** (see below)  https://preview.redd.it/cjf86qh3z82b1.png?width=978&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5359188837bfc2b46e008f2033ef40cc26092c09  Link: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial\_astronaut#:\~:text=The%20FAA's%20Commercial%20Astronaut%20Wings,an%20FAA%2FAST%20licensed%20mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_astronaut#:~:text=The%20FAA's%20Commercial%20Astronaut%20Wings,an%20FAA%2FAST%20licensed%20mission).  So in summary it's the millionaire version of the Lady &amp; Lord established title thing, except it's real.  Why go to school for 6 years and be a Doctor if you could add "astronaut" to the end of everything for the same amount of money? If someone is willing to throw out millions on a yacht slightly larger than their peers, why won't they drop the money on a spaceflight?  &amp;#x200B;  That all brings me back to why the stock is tanking, they just had a successful test flight of their new craft and the stock is down 15% today. Maybe it's "priced in" but my guess is that the FUD is getting laid on thick since it is becoming likely that SPCE will be a serious market competitor, potentially taking sales away from Blue Origin or SpaceX, but the reality is that the market is so much larger than current  capacity ([https://www.valuepenguin.com/travel/americans-space-travel](https://www.valuepenguin.com/travel/americans-space-travel)) and it will take decades to saturate that market. Virgin Galactic is the only relatively affordable spaceflight option right now and if it goes away, space tourism will be a thing only accessible by the ultra-wealthy.  &amp;#x200B;  TLDR: I like the stock, but I'm probably regarded, so that's why I like it. Or maybe I've had too much caffeine today. This is not financial advice, this is the dumpster behind a wendys.

[What you need to do for ORCL earnings tonight.,;,; Oracle (ORCL) kicks off a relatively light week for corporate earnings reports, with the enterprise software firm set to disclose its fiscal fourth-quarter results today after close. The stock is currently trading at record highs today, up 5.8% at $116.28 at last glance, and earlier hitting a peak of $117. Analysts, on average, expect ORCL to unveil earnings of $1.58 per share, up 2.6% year-over-year (YoY), on $13.7 billion in revenue (+15.9% YoY). ORCL is expected to report a YoY increase in both profit and revenue for FQ4, which will partly be due to the integration of health information technologies firm Cerner, the acquisition of which closed in November 2022. Over the last 2 years, ORCL has beaten EPS estimates 75% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 75% of the time. However, in early March they posted mixed FQ3 results and provided an outlook that generally failed to excite investors.  J.P. Morgan Securities raised its price target to $109 from $93 ahead of the results, and over the weekend, Wolfe Research upgraded the shares to "outperform from "peer perform," citing tailwinds related to artificial intelligence (AI). Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 23 upward revisions and 0 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 9 upward revisions and 11 downward.  ORCL has finished three of its past eight post-earnings sessions higher, including a 10.4% pop last June. This time around, options traders are pricing in a next-day swing of 12.6%, regardless of direction, which is higher than the 5.2% move the stock has averaged over the past two years.   The Cerner deal (mentioned earlier) from 2022, in an all-cash transaction amounting to $28.3 billion or $95 per share, had boosted revenue estimates for ORCL, but also said that it had had a lagging effect on earnings per share. It's expected to have bolstered the company‚Äôs position in the lucrative healthcare domain. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Cerner contributed $1.5 billion to the total revenues driven by continued strength in the Fusion, Autonomous Database and OCI services. For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, total cloud, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 51% to 53% at cc and from 49% to 51% in USD.  ORCL's cloud results will also no doubt be closely watched. ORCL is a distant fourth in the cloud computing market behind Amazon's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG), but brokerages such as Guggenheim have highlighted the benefits from such a position.  Accelerated digital transformation, along with the continuation of remote work and mainstream adoption of the hybrid/flexible work model, is likely to have driven demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services and the company‚Äôs other cloud-based applications in the to-be-reported quarter. Continued momentum in back-office cloud-based Fusion Human Capital Management solutions, along with NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP applications, is expected to have favored ORCL‚Äôs quarterly performance.  Oracle announced on May 18 that it would join the Scheduling Standards Consortium to boost logistical effectiveness. The company's ERP division may have benefited from the move of many sizable SAP clients to Oracle Fusion ERP cloud and rising deal success in a number of industries, including banking and healthcare.  The strong uptake of Oracle's Dedicated Region Cloud and next-generation Autonomous Database, underpinned by machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities, may have helped the bottom line. Gen2 public cloud architecture is seeing significant momentum for autonomous databases.  It's increasingly obvious that calls are going to be the play for this one. I'm going to buy the 120c for 3.60 and sell the 125c for 2.30. This means I can get the spread for $130 and potentially make 3.8x gains on this one. Keep in mind tho, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction.

[My lotto play for DIS's earnings tonight,;,; Disney is reporting it's fiscal second quarter earnings after the bell. I'm wondering if the media conglomerate can keep regaining its mojo with Disney shares up +13% year to date to top the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs +8%.  Here are what analysts expect:  * Earnings per share: 93 cents per share expected, according to a [Refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/) survey of analysts  * Revenue: $21.79 billion expected, according to Refinitiv  * Disney+ total subscriptions: 163.17 million expected, according to [StreetAccount](https://www.streetaccount.com/)  They're expecting a drop in Disney‚Äôs second-quarter earnings per share compared to the Q2 2022 EPS, but with Q2 sales up from the prior-year quarter. Investors will be hoping that Disney can post another better-than-expected quarter on its bottom line and show a consistent illustration that the company is working in the right direction to elevate its profitability margin despite what is still a challenging macroeconomic environment for most companies.   Notably, Disney easily surpassed its Q1 EPS expectations by 43% last quarter. The earnings beat was driven by a 21% YoY increase in the Parks, Experiences, and Products segment revenue at $8.7 billion. This led to shares of DIS spiking more than 5% before cooling down and drifting lower in the following weeks. Certainly, more sustainability in Disney‚Äôs price movement after reporting its Q2 results is at focus in hopes that this year‚Äôs rally can be extended.  Beyond day-to-day operations at the company, we're going to expect Bob Iger (CEO of Disney) to address a number ongoing challenges. On Monday, Disney expanded its [federal lawsuit](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/26/disney-sues-florida-gov-ron-desantis-alleges-political-effort-to-hurt-its-business.html) against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, accusing the Republican leader of doubling down on his ‚Äú[retribution campaign](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/disney-lawsuit-against-desantis-expanded.html)‚Äù against the company by [signing legislation](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/05/desantis-signs-bill-to-void-disney-development-deals.html) to void Disney‚Äôs development deals in Orlando.  Additionally, the company is already [seeing rippling effects from the ongoing writers strike](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/hollywood-writers-strike-halts-stranger-things-severance-production.html), including the production shutdowns of Marvel Studios‚Äô ‚ÄúBlade,‚Äù which was set to begin filming in Atlanta next month, as well as the Disney+ Star Wars series ‚ÄúAndor.‚Äù  **IGER &amp; Cost Cutting**  In regard to Disney increasing its margins, Iger returned to the helm of the company last November with the initiative to reduce expenses and sustain growth and profitability.  During its last quarterly report and Iger‚Äôs first back as CEO, the Disney boss announced the company would cut thousands of jobs and reduce its capital expenditures by $5.5 billion. To the delight of investors, Iger stated the cost-cutting initiatives will make it possible for Disney‚Äôs board to approve the reinstatement of its dividend by the end of the year. We expect a third wave of layoffs within the company announced soon.  **Streaming Growth**  Like streaming competitor Netflix (NFLX), Disney will no longer provide guidance for subscriber growth. With that being said, Disney‚Äôs ability to add subscribers during the quarter will be at the forefront of its Q2 results.  Specifically, Wall Street is eyeing Disney+ after the streaming service lost 2.4 million subscribers during Q1 amid subscription price hikes and increasing competition from big-name tech stocks like AAPL, and AMZN. This was the firstly quarterly loss since Disney+ was launched in 2019. Still, a wider loss was expected among Disney+ subscribers last quarter with Disney topping estimates by 3%.  Disney+ had 161.8 million paid subscribers during Q1 and 234.7 million total subscribers when including its ESPN+ and Hulu services. While Disney‚Äôs total paid subscribers topped Netflix‚Äôs 232.5 million paying members, the company‚Äôs Direct to Consumer segment reported a -$1.1 billion loss during Q1 up from -$0.5 billion in the prior-year quarter.  Disney stated the increase in operating loss was due to a higher loss at Disney+ and a decrease in results at Hulu although there were improved results at ESPN+. Direct to Consumer revenue did increase by 13% YoY during Q1 to $5.3 billion.    Improvement in operating costs among the Direct to Consumer segment will make Disney‚Äôs stock much more attractive. Longer-term investors are hoping that Disney‚Äôs growth among streaming services will eventually lead to massive earnings potential for the company.  **Earnings Expected Move**  Looking at the implied volatility of the options market in Disney, we can see the weekly expected move for the rest of the week is ¬±$3.55 - about 3.5% of the stock‚Äôs notional value. This is not too high of an expected move for an equity, but it is about 77% of the expected move through the June options cycle 39 days away from expiration, and over 50% of the expected move in the July options expiration cycle. Based on this information, the market is placing a lot of weight on Wednesday's earnings report, given the high implied volatility in the weekly cycle relative to further-dated cycles.  With DIS stock trading at $100.70 (at the time of writing this), we can go to equidistant out-of-the-money (OTM) strikes to see if there is a difference in premium, or skewed premium. Looking into the option chain, in this case, the calls is trading for a bit more than the puts, both 5 points OTM from the current stock price. This tells us that Disney‚Äôs options market has call skew in the weekly cycle. This indicates that a high velocity move is being priced into the upside ‚Äì this does not mean the stock is going to go up, but the market is pricing in the risk of a high velocity move to the upside just slightly.  **What to do For Disney Earnings?**  I looked through the last 5 years of movements with earnings, the stock moves on average 4 ¬± 3% after the earnings report. With this said, it might not even be worth getting calls or puts because the premium prices are pricing a move that's very very similar to this percentage. However, given everything I've looked at, I want to get puts. DIS 5/12 99p is 2.03. However, I'll be inversing myself because of the WSB Cramer tag and will make big money with a call spread. I can buy the DIS 5/12 102c for $241 and sell the 105c for $140. This means I can grab the spread for $101, and potentially make 3x gains. Because, why not?,;,; 2023-05-10 18:19:11]

[Week Ended May 5 - Recap and thoughts for next week- Is this "recession" with us in the room right now?,;,; &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/fs6k19crngya1.jpg?width=635&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c7a57ebce7e77e59490c256abe4bb7853451afb  TLDR: After the Fed hiked 25bp as expected, a June pause is on the table. Inflation indicators turned hotter in April with consumer spending leading the way. The US economy showed signs of a rebound in last week's ISM report, while global demand remained soft. The Q1 earnings season is coming to an end with results exceeding expectations. However, things may not be as bright under the hood. Regional and small bank pain may not have ended yet, with deposit outflow and commercial real estate being their biggest risks.  # Market-moving News  **The Fed hike 25bp and putting pause on the table.** On Wednesday, the Fed hiked another 25bp, marking the tenth consecutive raise and bringing the benchmark rate to 5-5.25%. This decision pleased both bulls and bears, as JP raised the possibility of a pause in June while emphasizing that the decision would depend on data. Inflation remains a priority for JP, and he seemed to be happy with the progress made in disinflation while keeping the job market strong. However, he did express concerns about tightening credit conditions, which we will learn more about in next week's SLOOS report. This week's summary of inflation-related news leans mostly towards a neutral to negative outlook, indicating an increased risk of inflation picking up again.  https://preview.redd.it/m3okmc85ngya1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa307490f8ea74e0e0a742f44453e6cdc8984a95  **Economic indicators have largely rebounded from previous lows**, with notable improvement seen in the ISM manufacturing report released on Monday. The report indicated a recovery from the low point observed in March and surpassed expectations. However, it is important to note that both prices paid and received have increased, leading to higher inflationary pressures. Global demand remains weak, particularly in the European Union (EU) and China, while domestic economic activity shows signs of picking up pace. The Atlanta Fed has raised its Q2 GDP estimate to 2.7% due to robust consumer spending. Here is a summary of the major economic data from last month, with a focus on the manufacturing sector.  https://preview.redd.it/19eidn16ngya1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=83e93d531e63aaa8f0fd2196e31f7cdcb78cdde2  **Q1 earnings have thus far exceeded expectations, although there have been minimal changes to the full-year estimates**. As of Friday, 85% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 have reported their actual results. Among the reporting companies, 79% have reported actual earnings per share (EPS) above estimates, surpassing the 5-year average of 77% and the 10-year average of 73%. In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings that are 7.0% above estimates, which exceeds the 10-year average of 6.4%. The blended earnings decline for the first quarter stands at -2.2%, which represents an improvement from the -3.7% reported last week and the -6.7% at the end of the first quarter (March 31). However, it is important to note that this marks the second consecutive quarter with a year-over-year decline in earnings. Analysts are projecting a decline of -5.7% in earnings for Q2 2023, followed by growth of 1.2% in Q3 2023 and 8.5% in Q4 2023. For the entire year of 2023, analysts predict earnings growth of 1.2%.  However, it is worth noting that Q1 earnings were skewed by three companies (AMZN, UBER, TDOC) that had significant losses due to write-downs from acquisitions in the previous year. In Q1 last year, AMZN wrote down 3.8 billion for RIVN, UBER wrote down 5.9 billion for Grab, DiDi, and Aurora, and TDOC wrote down 6.6 billion for Livongo. As these write-downs were removed from their balance sheets in Q1 this year, these companies reported substantial growth in earnings. Excluding these companies, the earnings picture is actually much weaker (though still slightly better than estimated).  https://preview.redd.it/ifrkhs47ngya1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45e486ff0c9554aa2618c83ca04da42b11b6b5a4  **The regional bank selloff was the major drama of last week, and not without cause.** While the overall stock market remained relatively stable throughout the week, regional banks faced considerable challenges. Some regional bank stocks experienced a drastic decline of over 50% on Thursday, only to rebound on Friday. The roller coaster ride was largely impulse driven. However, there are potential fundamental risks associated with regional and small banks.  Let's start with the good news. Fed H8 (assets and liabilities of commercial banks) report was released on Friday. Notably, there continues to be a "walk" of deposits from both large and small commercial banks. However, the outflow observed during the week was smaller than the previous week, and the outflow from small banks did not surpass that of large banks (no deposit transfers from small banks to large banks like March).  https://preview.redd.it/wpiyiaj8ngya1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ca9813f05dbbd471a51e007436954b544f27953  And what's more encouraging is that both large and small banks experienced accelerated loan growth compared to the previous week, particularly small banks, which exhibited the fastest year-to-date expansion in loans. This credit expansion typically signifies confidence from these banks and suggests they may perceive greater stability in the sector and the overall economy (although this is before the selloff on Thursday).  https://preview.redd.it/9pxizhd9ngya1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cda1427aec6b771856d4ac17bb987cfd29cffe90  From the Fed's perspective, I do not believe they would allow any bank to default and depositors to lose their savings. While the Fed may not care much about small banks, maintaining public confidence in the overall banking sector is crucial. The Fed possesses the authority (via the ability to initiate monetary expansion) and the determination (as demonstrated by the swift bailout of SVB in just two days) to promptly address any potential systemic risks. However, this does not necessarily mean these banks will survive. Currently, there are two risks that should not be overlooked.  1. The risk of deposit outflows and a potential bank run is a significant concern. Fear and panic can often outweigh rationality in such situations. As long as people have alternatives and no compelling reason to bank with these small institutions, there is a diminishing incentive for them to deposit funds. This could lead to a gradual erosion of deposits or even a sudden bank run. I simply cannot see how the situation can be reversed in the short term. 2. Another major risk for small banks lies in their exposure to commercial real estate (CRE). In addition to potential losses on bonds and debt securities, these banks have a substantial portion of their loan portfolio tied up in CRE loans. As the value of commercial properties declines rapidly, the collateral backing these loans becomes weaker, posing a significant threat to the stability and financial health of these institutions.  https://preview.redd.it/cdc2zrmangya1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af89925be2383fea499e0270b294f5a38b8dbb5f  There are types of CRE loans, but the most significant issue arises from office loans. With the increasing number of individuals working remotely, the vacancy rates for office spaces in the United States have been rising and reached a new high in the first quarter.  https://preview.redd.it/i9chnp1cngya1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4fc6637c3449ae535e5781e1ec47d3d47ffe0fa9  As a result, these office properties are experiencing a rapid decline in value. Office buildings have already witnessed a 7% decrease in valuation since last year, and forecasts suggest that they could potentially lose up to 30% in value before reaching the bottom.  https://preview.redd.it/hawmw6vcngya1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e05cd6c07b401042d76ff436fcfe43f1c7aefab6  Meanwhile, there is a pressing issue regarding the refinancing of approximately $700 billion in mortgages on office buildings this year. These loans will need to be refinanced at significantly higher rates compared to when they were initially originated, further complicated by the decreased property values. The consequences of tighter credit conditions and diminishing rental income have already started to emerge. The delinquency rate on office loans has been rising since the beginning of the year, contrasting with the relatively stable delinquency rates observed in other CRE loans.  https://preview.redd.it/j08op2qdngya1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bf89d2b1776bc89c566b5c40659fa82e8daa82f  The financing rates on subprime commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) have been experiencing a substantial increase since March.  https://preview.redd.it/fady5ndengya1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=90c8d5e52fa8bb8da5ec2db9806186c8625d3ec3  The concerns surrounding the office sector are undeniably reflected in the year-to-date (YTD) performance of office real estate investment trusts (REITs).  https://preview.redd.it/6ux2xq2fngya1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f68ff9c7f48f8b2a01bb9d211f944ea976837233  In terms of bank exposures, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. holds the largest office exposure among banks, with a total of $36.14 billion as of year-end 2022. However, this exposure represents only 3.8% of their gross loans.  https://preview.redd.it/oqtiuj5gngya1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06bac084d3c7b70af65fa5d399c418e0fbf67fab  Which small banks has the biggest exposure to CRE loans? You guessed it:  New York Community Bancorp. (NYCB), which recently bought the assets of Silicon Valley Bank, has CRE loan exposure to the tune of 71% of its entire loan book. Other notable names on the list include EastWest Bancorp. (EWBC) with 39%, PacWest Bancorp. (PACW) and Western Alliance (WAL) with 28% and some other names which shall not be mentioned on this board.  In conclusion, while the overall banking sector may not currently face systemic risk, certain small and regional banks could face significant challenges due to deposit outflows and potential defaults in the CRE (especially office) loans.  # My positions and predictions  **US Equity**  *Valuation*  After this week‚Äôs earnings reports, 2023 SP500 EPS estimation unchanged last week:  2023 Full Year EPS: $221  NTM: $230 ($2 increase from last week)  2024 Full Year EPS: $247  Current forward PE 18.0, lower than 5-year average of 18.5 and higher than 10-year average of 17.3. In terms of valuation, we are slightly lower than last week (18.3).  https://preview.redd.it/50g1c0shngya1.png?width=726&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db7ecd6fb3b39d4447ad9ece9ef8fdee4a161a59  My investment thesis has not changed. The stock price is too high due to a low risk premium:  https://preview.redd.it/qjrh1ogingya1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eb6563fd3064f92e2a84f3b86466adf59bf04d43  If we apply a risk premium of 3% to the valuation of the S&amp;P 500, the stock market today should have a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.4. Assuming the next twelve months (NTM) earnings per share (EPS) is $230 and the projected EPS for 2024 is $247, we can estimate that the S&amp;P 500 index should be at 3542 today and 3804 by year-end (might be higher since the yield on Treasury bills is probably lower at year-end).  *Headwinds and tailwinds based on this week‚Äôs data*  https://preview.redd.it/yqw7qkpjngya1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a70443b854ab339a8aec3f474f48efceb1887a9e  *My year-end projection:*  My base case (shown in green) has not changed from last week. Assume SP500 earnings of $247 for 2024, with inflation stabilizing under 4% and continuing to decline. The Fed will pause after May hike and keep rate unchanged until year-end, before starting to cut in 2024. Year-end target is between 3920 to 4410 for SP500 based on 16-18X forward PE ratio.  Light blue box is where we are today. If we use 10-yr average forward PE ratio (17X), 3900 is a more appropriate level, and if we use risk premium model, we should be close to 3600.  https://preview.redd.it/284du8pkngya1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=400444f6f22ae4f947e6d91a87a574c56680ed3b  If the current "Goldilocks" situation persists, characterized by a resilient economy and consumers, along with inflation reaching 3% by year-end, small-cap stocks, particularly those in the Small Growth style, could present an interesting investment opportunity. These stocks are currently trading at attractive valuations and tend to perform well in a slow expansion environment with low interest rates.  https://preview.redd.it/iqorp3glngya1.png?width=714&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ce9ac50cbdf1d9f8fba7a192f4910f0c6a11930e  ![img](9jz9hy5mngya1 "U.S. equity size and style total returns as of 5/5/23 (%) ")  Current Positions (not changed):  SPY 6/15 400 Put  IWM 6/15 165 Put  TLT Jan 2024 110/115 leap call spreads,;,; 2023-05-07 19:28:49]

[Nasdaq leads Wall Street rally as hopes of Fed rate-hike pause grow,;,; Mainly rate-sensitive technology and growth stocks rose after the Federal Reserve signaled an imminent pause in rate hikes amid turmoil in the banking sector, with the Nasdaq leading Wall Street's main indexes higher.  &amp;#x200B;  Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Amazon. STARQ: AMZN ) were each up about 2% on Thursday.  &amp;#x200B;  Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) shares rose 3.3% after Needham raised its price target on the chipmaker, citing the company's potential to benefit from recent data center strength.  &amp;#x200B;  Communication services and technology stocks led gains in the S&amp;P 500 .  &amp;#x200B;  The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday, but its policy statement stopped saying "continued rate hikes" might be appropriate, marking a marked shift in its stance.  &amp;#x200B;  The Fed's dovish tone has eased markets that have been roiled by concerns about a liquidity crisis in the banking sector since the collapse of two regional U.S. banks earlier this month.  &amp;#x200B;  "The market is hoping that you might have one more hike," said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth in Fairfield, Connecticut.  &amp;#x200B;  "I can imagine hopes (for a rate cut) being dashed.

[Apple, Amazon and Coinbase Earnings Today,;,; Today we have a pretty massive line up with earnings, and I wanted to offer my 2 cents for those looking to play either Apple or Amazon  **Apple**  Let's start with AAPL. Apple‚Äôs stock is up over 51% so far in 2023, hitting all-time highs. I honestly see it as a safe haven with strong cash flow, even tho investors have been worrying about slowing demand for consumer goods, including PCs and smartphones. During the call, I'll want to hear about how the current quarter, which ends in September, is shaking out. Apple hasn‚Äôt given guidance since 2020, citing uncertainty, but they will provide us with some data points that they can use to determine whether Apple sees overall sales growing or shrinking. Wall street is expecting   * Revenue: $81.7 billion  &gt; iPhone revenue: $40.2 billion  &gt; iPad revenue: $6.4 billion  &gt; Mac revenue: $6.3 billion  &gt; Other products: $8.3 billion  &gt; Services: $20.7 billion  * EPS: $1.19 per share  The company‚Äôs forecast will be more important. It may give clues as to whether global economies are set up for a ‚Äú[soft landing](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/15/collective-embrace-of-soft-landing-economic-scenario-extends-2023-rally-after-welcome-drop-in-cpi.html)‚Äù after two years of interest rate hikes. The June period is typically Apple‚Äôs slowest quarter of the year, while its fourth fiscal quarter often captures back-to-school laptop spending, a few days of new iPhone model sales ‚Äî which usually come out in September ‚Äî and shows Apple‚Äôs momentum heading into the holiday season.  ‚ÄúWhat will matter most will be management‚Äôs September quarter,‚Äù wrote Morgan Stanley analyst [Erik Woodring](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/erik-woodring) in July, adding that he expects Apple to guide to year-over-year revenue growth again.   I'm eager to see Apple give data points on India sales. Apple CEO Tim Cook traveled to the country in April and spoke about hopes for significant growth in the region. India became one of Apple‚Äôs top five iPhone markets during the quarter.  I don't know if people follow professional analyst notes, but [D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote this week,](https://dadavidson.com/Who-We-Serve/Equity-Capital-Markets/Our-Professionals/ECM-Profiles/ArticleID/1208/Tom-Forte-CFA) ‚ÄúOn the call, we look for additional details on its expansion in India, including its retail and manufacturing presence.‚Äù   But Apple‚Äôs older growth driver, China, is likely to be closely watched as well. Greater China ‚Äî including Hong Kong and Taiwan ‚Äî is Apple‚Äôs third-largest sales region, and it has reported two straight quarters of revenue decline, even as the region reopened after years of strict Covid lockdowns.  ‚ÄúIn our conversations, most investors feel that a soft China could pose a risk to the numbers and further commentary, but we feel that Apple‚Äôs position in China is on a solid footing and that the company is likely to see only a small if any decline in its iPhone sales,‚Äù wrote [Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar](https://www.pipersandler.com/about/people/harsh-kumar). Kumar said if China ends up being weak, it could be offset by strong sales momentum in India.  Apple mainly manufactures in China and investors will want to hear that the company has overcome many of the supply chain snags that have hampered sales over the past two years. If Apple stockpiled parts and has enough to make what it needs to produce, it could help margins.  Maybe people are tired of me tossing random names in the air, but a lot of these analysts are paid to do the heavy-hitting research, so it's only beneficial to read up on what they say. J.P. Morgan analyst [Samik Chatterjee](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/samik-chatterjee) thinks it is time to start viewing Apple in a new light, and I agree with this sentiment. Rather than seeing the tech giant as a product cycle company, it should be seen as a ‚Äòresilient earnings compounder.‚Äô  ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs diversified revenue drivers within Hardware, as well as the natural diversification of the replacement cycle for hardware product on account of a ~2 bn installed base of devices has moved the company incrementally away from being dependent on a product cycle relative to iPhones or any other hardware,‚Äù the analyst opined.  Moreover, the Services segment has grown significantly over time and is now well diversified in terms of its drivers, allowing it to achieve double-digit growth (excluding currency impact) even during challenging economic times. This ‚Äúinherent diversification‚Äù positions the company next to other ‚Äú‚Äôearnings compounders‚Äô with resilient drivers.‚Äù  It also makes it easier to justify the premium multiple the stock has been trading at for the last six months, one which it is likely now to hold on to. Apple‚Äôs profitable services division includes monthly subscriptions such as Apple Music, warranties under AppleCare, fees from the App Store, advertising revenue from search licensing agreements with Google, payments from Apple Pay and other products. I'd like to see Apple‚Äôs services business grow regularly and smoothly, because the margins on services are so much higher than when Apple sells hardware. In particular, many analysts want to see services re-accelerate after a few quarters of weak growth because of lagging App Store software sales.  Apple suggested a 5.5% year-over-year increase in services](https://www.pymnts.com/apple/2023/apples-services-segment-slows-to-5-5-growth-rate/), and [FactSet‚Äôs](https://www.factset.com) estimates more than $20.7 billion in revenue. In fact, given the fact Apple is ‚Äúwell positioned to drive higher confidence from the upcoming earnings print as an ‚Äòearnings compounder‚Äô that continues to drive resilient performance,‚Äù Chatterjee thinks a new price target is due.  As for what to look out for in the report, Chatterjee expects the major highlight will be the pivot back to revenue growth on a year-over-year basis in F4Q23 (September quarter), boosted by ‚Äútypical seasonality‚Äù in the majority of the business‚Äô segments but with an additional kick from ‚Äúmoderating currency and improving Services growth rates as advertising rebounds.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe return to growth will mark Apple cycling past the most uncertain macro backdrop with resilient revenue and earnings, and well positioned to drive robust growth in a normal macro,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúFor the Services business, we expect year-over-year revenue growth to accelerate from the +5% level expected in [fiscal third quarter,] with our checks suggesting online advertising has improved,‚Äù [Deutsche Bank analyst Sidney Ho](https://stockanalysis.com/analysts/sidney-ho/) wrote. But analysts will want to see Apple signal more growth than that.   We also need to keep in mind, Apple's AI acceleration. These analysts will also likely ask about artificial intelligence, given the industry wide obsession with the technology. There's also been a recent [Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/apple-preps-ajax-generative-ai-apple-gpt-to-rival-openai-and-google) that Apple is developing a ChatGPT-like AI model internally. Don‚Äôt expect Apple to gush about what it‚Äôs working on internally, though. ‚ÄúWith the official intro of Vision Pro, we expect Apple‚Äôs updated comments on its AI aspirations to be a focus (albeit likely very high-level),‚Äù wrote [Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers.](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/aaron-rakers)  Apple reports its results by product line, which can give us a look into which businesses are thriving and which ones are in a down cycle. IPhone, iPad and Mac sales are all expected to be down on an annual basis, with iPad sales projected to drop nearly 11%. Wearables, the product category with headphones and Apple Watch ‚Äî and what will likely be the reporting category for Vision Pro when it goes on sale ‚Äî is projected to decline less than 1%. However, the experts expect Apple‚Äôs services business to grow 5.2% on an annual basis, which would be a bright spot for the report.  Given these details, I'm fairly sure AAPL calls will be the play today, but with high IV, I'm gonna grab a spread. I can buy the 8/4 192.5c for $300 and sell the 195c for $196. This means I can grab the spread for $104 each. Ideally, if AAPL were to go up just 1.8%, this means the spread can be sold at 140% profit.    **Amazon**  Okay, next is AMZN where analysts are predicting an earnings of $0.35 per share, significantly better than the loss of $0.200 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. In terms of sales, they anticipate an increase of 8.46% over the prior year quarter. For revenue, we expect them to report $131.49 billion. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts forecast a profit per share of $1.61. Data from [refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/en).  While revenue growth remains steady at Amazon, [it‚Äôs been stuck in the single digits](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/20/amazons-post-bezos-experiment-hasnt-gone-exactly-as-planned.html) for five out of the past six quarters. That trend is expected to continue, as analysts are looking for 8.5% growth in the second quarter and a number just slightly higher in the third period.  I believe Amazon‚Äôs expanding Amazon Web Services (AWS) will have a large impact on its second-quarter performance. Amazon Web Services has been a growth driver for years, but the pace of expansion is slowing as customers clamp down on spending due to an uncertain economic outlook. In the first quarter, AWS sales increased roughly 16%, the slowest growth since 2015, when Amazon began breaking out cloud revenue.   In the second quarter, AWS made its purpose-built security data lake, called Amazon Security Lake, generally available. The service aids in the simplification of compliance monitoring and security data management across hybrid and multi-cloud environments by centralizing an organization‚Äôs security data across AWS environments. It introduced a new configuration for Amazon Aurora, namely Amazon Aurora I/O-Optimized, which provides improved price performance and predictable pricing for I/O-intensive applications. It unveiled three new capabilities for its threat detection service called Amazon GuardDuty - GuardDuty EKS Runtime Monitoring, GuardDuty RDS Protection and GuardDuty Lambda Protection. AWS also announced the general availability of its no-code service, called AppFabric. I expect all these initiatives to have helped Amazon win customers. This, in turn, is expected to have boosted AWS‚Äôs second-quarter revenues, whose consensus mark stands at $21.49 billion, up 8.9% from the year-ago reported figure.  However, Brian Olsavsky (Amazon‚Äôs finance chief) warned in April that the company expects to see more of the same in the second quarter in cloud. In addition to cloud, profit margins will be an area of emphasis for investors, as well as artificial intelligence, a focus for companies across the sector.  ‚ÄúThe key question will be whether management suggests that with the timing of the optimization cycle, AI workloads, and easing comps that AWS is likely to start showing revenue growth acceleration beginning in Q3,‚Äù analysts at [Evercore](https://www.evercore.com), who have the equivalent of a buy rating on Amazon, wrote in a note this week. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know.‚Äù  AWS rivals Microsoft and Alphabet last week reported solid results in their cloud businesses, beating analysts‚Äô revenue expectations. But both companies said they continue to see organizations moderating their cloud spend.   Last week, Amazon hosted an AWS Summit, where the company announced updates related to generative AI, including a service that uses the technology to transcribe and summarize doctors‚Äô patient visits. Amazon‚Äôs results will give investors a sense of whether the company‚Äôs ongoing cost-cutting efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Evercore analysts said they expect to see improving margins in Amazon‚Äôs retail business in the second quarter, as ‚Äúcomps against ‚Äô22‚Ä≤s massive cost spikes, capacity utilization recovers, and newfound efficiencies from the regionalization of Amazon‚Äôs retail operations kick in.‚Äù  Recent data released by the company showed improving delivery speeds and efficiencies in Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment network. The company said it‚Äôs made significant headway on its efforts to establish one- and same-day delivery as the standard for Prime members, while also bringing costs down. Also during the quarter, Amazon hosted its annual Prime Day discount bonanza, which they claim as its ‚Äúbiggest ever.‚Äù Amazon‚Äôs guidance for the third quarter could give a glimpse into how much Prime Day lifted sales.  Amazon‚Äôs advertising business is becoming increasingly important to the company‚Äôs financials. Several industry surveys have indicated a slow rebound in the digital ad market may be underway. Meta showed better-than-expected results last week, but rival Snap fell short of sales expectations and gave a weak forecast for the current quarter.  With Amazon's earnings, it's certainly a toss up. But I'm learning bullish. I'm gonna go ahead and do another call spread, getting AMZN 130c at $380 a pop, and selling the 135c at $195 each. This means I can grab the spread for $185 each. If AMZN were to go up with earnings, just 4.8%, this play will profit 170%.   **Coinbase**  Last and certainly least, there's Coinbase. I don't know if anyone rememebers but the SEC [sued the crypto exchange](https://blockworks.co/news/sec-sues-coinbase) not too long ago. The lawsuit is in regards to them allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange.   At today's earnings, investors are gonna be listening to hear about trading volumes and adjusted EBITDA. Coinbase improved its net loss from $557 million during the fourth quarter of last year to $79 million in the first three months of 2023. The exchange generated $284 million in adjusted EBITDA ‚Äî earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ‚Äî last quarter compared to a $124 million loss in the prior quarter.   ‚ÄúUnlike last quarter [when] we saw potential upside going into the print, this quarter is the opposite,‚Äù said [Owen Lau](https://sps.columbia.edu/faculty/owen-lau), an executive director at Oppenheimer and Co. Lau mentioned that he estimates Coinbase‚Äôs trading volume will have fallen 34% quarter over quarter ‚Äî from $145 billion to $91 billion. The exchange‚Äôs adjusted EBITDA could fall about 90% to $29 million, he added.  [Mark Palmer](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/mark-palmer), an analyst for Berenberg Capital Markets, said the [Ripple ruling](https://blockworks.co/news/xrp-ruling-sec) and the prospects of a spot [bitcoin ETF](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/03/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-application-refiled-naming-coinbase-as-surveillance-sharing-partner/) approval have given some investors ‚Äúa false sense of confidence‚Äù about Coinbase‚Äôs prospects.  In addition to weak transaction volumes, Coinbase‚Äôs results are likely to reflect lower interest income from USD Coin (the digital stablecoin). The exchange, which [introduced the stablecoin](https://www.coinbase.com/) with payments company Circle in 2018, offers users rewards by holding USD Coin on Coinbase.  Interest income rose to about $240 million during the first quarter, up from $182 million during the prior quarter. Of that $240 million, $199 million was USD Coin, Coinbase said in its Q1 shareholder letter. But USD Coin‚Äôs market capitalization has fallen by more than 50% over the past year.  ‚ÄúWe see no reason why Coinbase‚Äôs guidance for the balance of the year should be particularly encouraging,‚Äù Palmer said. ‚ÄúWhile interest income on USD Coin has been a tailwind for Coinbase since interest rates started to rise, the continued decline in the stablecoin‚Äôs market cap raises real questions about the extent to which that income will support its operating performance going forward.‚Äù  Morningstar Analyst [Michael Miller](https://www.morningstar.com/authors/2412/michael-miller) said he will be paying particular attention to Coinbase‚Äôs expenses and non-trading revenue sources. So will I. The exchange‚Äôs operating expenses fell to $896 million in the first three months of 2023, a 24% drop from the previous quarter. The figure represented its lowest level of expenses since the first quarter of 2021.   ‚ÄúCoinbase has signaled that it‚Äôs pulling back on its investment spending during weak cryptocurrency markets and what it chooses to continue to invest in will indicate what it sees as priorities,‚Äù Miller mentioned.   Still, Coinbase said in its May shareholder letter that it expected second quarter expenses to increase due in part to higher legal expenses. Miller said he is also keeping an eye on any momentum Coinbase reports related to reducing its reliance on transaction fees.   Coinbase‚Äôs so-called subscription and services revenue, the bulk of which was interest income last quarter, also includes blockchain rewards from staking and custodial fee revenue. Combined, the category brought in about $362 million last quarter, compared to $375 million of transaction revenue.     ‚ÄúCoinbase being selected to provide custodial and surveillance services for a potential Blackrock ETF is a win on this front,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut it remains to be seen how much subscription and service growth Coinbase can create outside of interest income, which is now facing major headwinds.‚Äù   Guidance around the road forward as Coinbase deals with the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit could be helpful as well. The SEC has said it would oppose any motion brought by Coinbase seeking to dismiss the commission‚Äôs lawsuit. Honestly, any update related to Coinbase‚Äôs regulatory issues would very interesting but I‚Äôm not really expecting anything material to come out with earnings.  As a result of my research, I'm just gonna go ahead and get puts. COIN 8/4 90p is $420, and the 85p is trading at $242. Which means I can get a put spread for $178. Like the previous plays, I'm buying the more expensive contract, and selling the cheaper one as a hedge. If the stock were to drop 7.1%, this spread will profit 181%.,;,; 2023-08-03 19:33:44]

[Market Recap - 4/25/23 - Economy is flashing red while companies beating estimations left and right,;,; **The Fed**  TLDR, CBs are on schedule to tighten liquidity, bad for stonks.  As I mentioned in the weekend post, global liquidity is scheduled to be tightened again after the banking crisis in Q1.  Fitch: ECB is likely to pick up the pace of so-called quantitative tightening (QT) in July.  Money supply continues to decline in the US. As I have mentioned many times in my posts, liquidity is a very important leading indicator which should be closely monitored.  https://preview.redd.it/wroft1b9b4wa1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1cd78451a363b823b3892fac8d43829811d601e7  https://preview.redd.it/j0748mv9b4wa1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6ed2c971eae1aaf4e17b93a8316bfc89017e2013  **The Economy**  TLDR, More bad news for the economy. I am still not convinced that a recession is coming (as I mentioned yesterday, consumers and businesses balance sheets are still very strong), but the outlook is certainly more and more gloomy.   The Richmond Fed survey was released this morning. I am adding it to my table. Compared to other surveys, this is straight up bad. Not only are activities slowing down again, but prices paid/received are higher as well. It's a taste of stagflation."  https://preview.redd.it/oao307ffb4wa1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7af1a2e76d9100eae9aa81f8b62e481a14ba8e13  US Conference Board consumer confidence is down to 101.3 vs 104.0 last month.   ‚ÄúWhile consumers‚Äô relatively favorable assessment of the current business environment improved somewhat in April, their expectations fell and remain below the level which often signals a recession looming in the short-term,‚Äù   ‚ÄúConsumers became more pessimistic about the outlook for both business conditions and labor markets.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOverall purchasing plans for homes, autos, appliances, and vacations all pulled back in April, a signal that consumers may be economizing amid growing pessimism.‚Äù  Like I said yesterday, ‚Äúconsumers are financially in great shape, except nobody believes that they are!‚Äù  https://preview.redd.it/o1ngwiymb4wa1.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05eb147edc5a4b106158b0e0d228393250e33221  https://preview.redd.it/2sbib8tlb4wa1.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e5a9bb91ddc0a07ffe944bcbf3b9bfe37e81908  &amp;#x200B;  Anecdotally, I picked up on charts on Twitter that freight and 3PLs have slowed down significantly for the past few weeks. Quote:"I mean, in 2008, it wasn't as bad/slow as it is now. Many carriers are going out of business in recent months". I'm not sure how reliable this is or how much is due to the bullwhip effect from capacity expansion during COVID, but clearly, economic activities have been cooling and potentially accelerating to the downside. There isn't much being reflected in the economic data yet, but it's worth keeping an eye on.  The commodities market, including copper, oil, soy, wheat, etc., is turning around from recent rally this week, especially today. If this trend continues, it may indicate a gloomy economic condition up ahead.  https://preview.redd.it/zrvoxpjyb4wa1.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e565d22c69798b40dc8f18efd4550fd8e7defb9  **The Business**  TLDR, Overall, very strong earnings results today. Consumer staples (PE, MCD, CME, and KO yesterday) are very stable, and consumer discretionary is doing fantastic. This does not look like a weak economy to me. The only weakness came from transportation and industry (UPS and MMM), which signals some potential trouble ahead. After market close, both GOOG and MSFT beat expectations, but MSFT was in a much better position than GOOG (ad revenue barely beat and cloud actually missed). I still believe that Large Growth will be the best investment style for the rest of the year.  https://preview.redd.it/26mfj339c4wa1.png?width=272&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9c52a21592dc6cfb766df4e6187b2835e0de7ca  UPS missed both the top and bottom lines and guided lower as well. This is actually good news for disinflation (maybe some AMZN/SHOP puts?). Additionally, UPS and FedEx deferred volume is down significantly, which is another piece of evidence that spending on goods is slowing down (although it still just looks like a bullwhip phenomenon to me).  https://preview.redd.it/msqiixhcc4wa1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03100b272a21fcb9bf1cf55b7888337b1f474c85  Pepsico beat both top and bottom lines and guided higher. Most of the growth really came from inflation, but at least consumers are not cutting back on snacks yet. Similar observations from McDonald's, Coca Cola, and Chipotle. One important piece of information from Pepsico earnings call is that there will be no more price increases (most likely) for the rest of the year (good for disinflation).   https://preview.redd.it/k05n0dhfc4wa1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=10e23373faa84f86e5c340da9a522c141f8e489d  GM beat earnings estimates and guided higher. This is a bit surprising, especially considering that Whirlpool also beat expectations. In fact, the whole consumer discretionary sector was doing very well in Q1. This really is something you wouldn't expect to see if the economy is weakening.  https://preview.redd.it/putjhr4xc4wa1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c66be5d4f5a1ddd39667e1fdfc4d500afe5b5193  McDonald's beat earnings but missed revenue. However, they are now anticipating a recession as revenue per single order dropped and price resistance from dinners increased.  Visa confirmed that consumer spending is still very strong, with a 10% growth in payment volume.  https://preview.redd.it/wvella8yc4wa1.png?width=936&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8229ad3fd9a4833efca4da665327d012f6eaa38a   And I was right yesterday about the massive short position.

[S&amp;P - Theta price index,;,; ,;,; 2023-06-07 19:50:00]
[üöÄAMD Earnings: Time to Hit it Big,;,; So last week [I gave you guys AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17h0sy7/amazon_earnings_the_boomer_play_that_could_print/), the stock went up 7% after earnings and calls printed big time. An absolute banger. Now this week, let me show you what's in store for AMD and look at how we can make money on earnings tonight. Are we gonna see an earnings beat that sends us to the moon, or is it time to deploy the üí© emojis?  Whether its autonomous vehicles, entertainment, or healthcare, AMD‚Äôs processors are powering people and businesses at a cutting-edge level. Yup, that's right; this chip titan's tech is in everything from your mom's car to the PS5 you can't afford. And the company will look to demonstrate how broad its reach is when it reports third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings results after the closing bell Tuesday. We'll want to look to see whether AMD's streak of earnings beats can continue; working in AMD's favor is the noticeable rebound in global PC shipments suggesting that a recovery in the global PC market could be underway.   In the most recent quarter, worldwide PC shipments totaled 59.7 million units, marking an almost 17% decrease year over year. But that decline is showing signs of stabilization, [including sequential growth from the previous quarter](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/04-11-2023-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-declined-30-percent-in-first-quarter-of-2023), noted Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa. ‚ÄúThe rate of decline in the PC market has slowed, indicating that shipment volumes may have reached their lowest point,‚Äù said Kitagawa, then adding, ‚ÄúThere has been progress in reducing PC inventory after more than a year of issues, supported by a gradual increase in business PC demand." In other words; we've hit rock bottom and it's only up from here. With PCs no longer in freefall, AMD's got a shot at keeping its stock price soaring.   Meanwhile, AMD stock, which is up 48% year to date, while the S&amp;P 500's playing catch-up with a measly 7%. This is because even amid the PC decline challenges or past issues related to supply chains, the company demonstrates strong operating leverage evidenced by its ability to grow profits at a faster rate than its revenue. Assuming the company‚Äôs growth metrics rebound in Q3, along with strong guidance, AMD stock will continue to rise despite its recent outperformance. This company can turn a profit faster than you can say "capital gains tax."  The pencil pushers over at wall street are predicting 64 cents per share in earnings on $5.37 billion in revenue. Compare that to 67 cents and $5.62 billion last year, and you've got yourself some bearish vibes. But remember, CEO Lisa Su has hinted at a more bullish $5.7 billion revenue mark. AI demand alone could make this a $150 billion market by 2027.  Artificial intelligence will continue to push the semiconductor industry, and will really help AMD well into 2024 and so on. In the meantime, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann sees the data center's strength helping AMD, especially their new MI300A/X APU/GPU compute accelerators, which could blast Wall Street's expectations. For those who don't know, he's referring specifically to their accelerated processing units and graphics processing units. More on these products later.   Regulations on tech exports to China could be a curveball, but the longer-term outlook is good. PC demand is set to return by 2024, and the GPU market could grow by a crazy 34% annually over the next five years. This is as the data center industry is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 10.5% through 2030.  In the near term, AMD's management needs to tackle the chip industry's cyclical nature, but they've done it before. In the second quarter, the company beat on both the top and bottom lines by a penny, while Q2 revenue of $5.36 billion topped estimates by $40 million. This is despite the 18% year-over-year decline.  The beat was driven by 16% rise in the Embedded segment, which offset declines in Datacenter, Gaming and Client. During the quarter, operating income swung to a loss of $20 million from a year-ago gain of $526 million. But I expect AMD‚Äôs segment growth metrics to rebound in Q3. I'm fairly sure margin pressures have bottomed and are now ready for expansion. Assuming this comes with strong guidance for the holiday quarter. Here, AMD stock will continue to rise even with its recent outperformance.  KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh slapped a $160 price target and an 'overweight' rating, because he sees this rocket fuelling up for a late-year lift-off. He mentions, "Despite modest risk to 4Q guidance given the pushout of MI300A volumes and a more measured Genoa ramp, investors will likely look through any near-term miss in anticipation of a December MI300X launch event and Microsoft onstage endorsement, providing a clear catalyst for the stock into the end of the year."  As traders, will should also look for a detailed impact from expanded restrictions on the sale of advanced technologies to China, unveiled earlier this month by U.S. Trade Secretary Gina Raimondo.  The new restrictions, which expand upon new export rules put in place last year, are designed to limit China's access to "advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to (Chinese) military applications," Raimondo said.  China‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs described those efforts as "economic coercion and sci-tech bullying" earlier this year and described the moves as "against the principles of market economy and fair competition."  **AMD's Products**  During this last quarter, AMD expanded its FPGA portfolio with the launch of the Alveo UL3524 accelerator card. This is designed for ultra-low latency electronic trading applications. The latest state-of-the-art FPGA solution will help the company expand its footprint in the fintech domain. Fucking amazing.   AMD also expanded its portfolio with the launch of Kria K24 System-on-Module (SOM) and KD240 Drives Starter Kit. The K24 SOM features a custom-built Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC device and the supporting KD240 starter kit is a sub-$400 FPGA-based motor control kit.  They also continued by expanding its fourth-generation EPYC CPU portfolio with the launch of 8004 series processors. These are based on Zen 4c core and a new SP6 socket. For those who don't know, the EPYC 8004 series processors can provide up to two times better SPEC power performance (per system watt) compared with the closest competition. Computerphiles believe that AMD‚Äôs EPYC 8004 series processors deliver balanced performance and excellent energy efficiency that is required at the edge.  In addition to this, AMD unveiled the new Radeon RX 7800 XT and Radeon RX 7700 XT. Anyone in the gaming space? These new graphics cards are optimized to deliver incredibly high-performance, high-refresh 1440p gaming experiences for AAA and esports titles. The company also announced the availability of AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3, the next generation of the popular upscaling technology that is designed to offer massive performance boosts in supported games.  And not even that long ago, in August, AMD announced that Amazon Web Services has expanded its 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor-based offerings with the general availability of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) M7a and Amazon EC2 Hpc7a instances.  Moreover, AMD announced two new additions to the Radeon PRO W7000 series product line, the Radeon PRO W7600 and Radeon PRO W7500 workstation graphics cards.  **What do the other Analysts Say?**  * ‚ÄúWe expect slight upside to third-quarter results and a largely in-line-with-consensus fourth-quarter outlook. We believe PC tracked slightly better and data center tracked in line. We are modeling $300-400 million contribution from MI300 GPU in the fourth quarter, primarily from El Capitan supercomputer, which is a one-time project.‚Äù ‚Äî Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri  * ‚ÄúAMD‚Äôs calendar third-quarter estimates should be achievable, particularly assuming some benefit from improving consumer PC shipments. The risk rather, in our view, is CQ4 (and perhaps CQ1). The ramp of El Capitan should provide AMD some momentum; however, we are less clear that AMD can hit elevated expectations, which we believe will eventually require better server CPU shipments in light of continued weakness in cloud-service-provider spend.‚Äù ‚Äî Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson  * ‚ÄúThe AMD narrative feels all about their datacenter (and, particularly, their AI story) right now. In the near term the achievability of their second-half datacenter growth (guided to 50% half over half) will be the question (we think the growth into year-end is plausible as most of it is likely from El Capitan but Q1 estimates may bear some watching), though CPU share as Genoa finally hit crossover will also be top of mind.‚Äù ‚Äî Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon  **What to do for Earnings**  Given everything that I've read so far, I'm sure calls are the way to go here. I'll be getting AMD 11/03 100c @ 2.58, the stock will need a ~5% rise to break even. I expect this and more. Keep in mind, this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. On Wednesday, we have ROKU, PYPL, and ABNB. And of course on Thursday, we have PLTR, SHOP, AAPL, COIN, DKNG, and SQ. I'll probably be making two more posts this week.,;,; 2023-10-31 17:10:48]

[Google, Amazon, and Unity are among the tech companies implementing layoffs to start 2024,;,; Google, Amazon, and Unity are among the tech companies implementing layoffs to start 2024, echoing trends observed in 2023. Tech firms persist in cost-cutting, efficiency improvement, and adapting to a cooling labor market. The U.S. unemployment rate stands at 3.7%, a near 50-year low, yet recent months have seen a slowdown in job gains. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employers added 105,000 workers in October, 173,000 in November, and 216,000 in December, below the 2023 monthly average of 225,000.   Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) confirmed on Thursday that it is laying off hundreds of staff across its voice assistant, hardware, and engineering teams. A Google spokesperson mentioned organizational changes, including role eliminations globally, aligning with product priorities.  Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman are reportedly leaving the company after Google's $2.1B acquisition in 2021, amidst competition with the Apple (AAPL) Watch. Alphabet also made several cuts in 2023, including an announcement in January to eliminate roughly 12,000 jobs.  Unity Software (NYSE:U) announced a 25% staff cut this week, aiming to restructure and refocus its core business for long-term and profitable growth. Approximately 1,800 employees are impacted, with the company unable to reasonably estimate costs associated with the reduction until the first quarter of 2024. Despite revenue growth, Unity has struggled to turn a profit, leading to a 20% decline in shares over the past six months.  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to cut several hundred employees in its media units, including Prime Video and MGM Studios. Reports suggest a 35% reduction in the Twitch workforce, affecting around 500 workers, and a 5% cut in the Audible workforce. Like tech counterpart Alphabet, Amazon made various employment cuts in the previous year.  Xerox (NASDAQ:XRX) announced a 15% reduction in its workforce in the first quarter of this year as part of a restructuring plan. The plan focuses on improving and stabilizing the core print business, increasing productivity through a new Global Business Services organization, and directing Digital Services and IT Services capabilities towards more profitable markets. This restructuring follows a 6% year-over-year decline in third-quarter sales.,;,; 2024-01-14 15:16:45]
[Amazon Earnings: The Boomer Play that Could Print üöÄüí∞,;,; Alright, buckle up degenerates, here comes Amazon's earnings rollercoaster. Is this the meme stock of the month? Nah, but it could be the boomer play that prints. Let's break it down. üöÄ Amazon is set to report earnings today, the company's had massive earnings growth this year, beating EPS estimates by 44% and 89% in the last two quarters, respectively. Today, the quarterly earnings are expected to come in at an EPS of $0.60 on $141.5 billion in revenue. $127.1 billion the previous year.  Jeff Bezos might've shot himself into space, but his money-making behemoth stays grounded on Earth. The company is doing well with amazon shares are up 42% this year, topping the Nasdaq‚Äôs 23% gain. So, the big question: YOLO some calls for earnings or nah? After Amazon‚Äôs growth slowed dramatically last year due to rising inflation and economic concerns, expansion has ticked up a bit in 2022, though it‚Äôs still weaker than usual for the company. Amazon‚Äôs retail business is expected to show some improvement from consumers tepidly resuming discretionary spending.   Analysts are expecting growth of 11% in the third quarter, marking a slight acceleration from the past couple quarters. E-commerce sales boomed during the pandemic, then slowed as shoppers returned to physical stores. I'll be focused on the results of Amazon's Prime Big Deals Days event, as well as guidance for consumer spending during the holidays.  **Cloud Computing**  Being the world's largest cloud provider and a significant profit driver for amazon (nearly 70%), all eyes will be on Amazon Web Services (AWS).   Amazon‚Äôs cloud computing business is a concern for a lot of people in wall street, as growth in AWS has been slowing in recent quarters. Google just reported earnings and one of its misses was in the cloud revenue department‚Äîcould this mean that AWS is taking more of the lion's share. However, you'd think the frenzy around generative artificial intelligence is leading to bigger workloads in the cloud, which should be a boon for AWS and its rival public cloud vendors. Looking at Microsoft (MSFT), sales in their Azure cloud unit grew 29%, faster than the 26% expected by analysts. This is considered bitter sweet as this could be eating into AWS' market share.   I expect stable AWS revenue, but want to know more about higher energy costs and rising competition. They currently hold a 40% share of the cloud services market last year, compared to Microsoft's 21.5% and Google's 7.5%.  **Ads**  Let's talk ads. Amazon's ad sales are right up there with Alphabet (GOOG) and Meta (META), so it will be interesting to see how it fared this quarter. One of Amazon's fastest-growing business sectors. Alphabet beat ad-sales estimates by almost $1 billion this quarter and Amazon will look to report similar success.  **AI**  Microsoft has OpenAI, we all know this. Amazon wanted in on the AI space and and in Sept announcing a deal to invest up to $4 billion in OpenAI competitor Anthropic. Additionally, in April, Amazon launched Amazon Bedrock, a service that allows users of Amazon's AWS to create generative AI applications. During the earnings call, I'm interested in hearing if there are any gains from its AI efforts. As mentioned earlier, the rise in AI causes more people to use cloud computing services like AWS.   **What do the experts say?**  BofA Global Research analyst Justin Post mentioned stuff that I've already written up here in a research note, stating that AWS is the Street‚Äôs top focus area, with some third-party sources suggesting that demand has decelerated. He's specifically betting on 12.5% growth for AWS, but cautions that a number in the 11% range would likely trigger selling. But further ads that a number above 13% would likely spur the stock higher.  On top of this, Post says aggregated credit and debit card data suggests online spending rose 1% from a year ago in the quarter, a two point acceleration from the June quarter. And he notes that ‚Äúad spending checks were also constructive.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe see retail upside potential driven by logistics efficiency, ads, fee increases, and easing comps,‚Äù Post writes ‚Äúwhile we think AWS can accelerate in Q4 with more acceleration in Q1 2024 on an easing optimization cycle and incremental AI demand.‚Äù Post keeps his Buy rating and $174 target price on the stock. Mind you, the stock is literally at $118 right now.   **What to do for earnings**  My magic 8-ball says both revenue and EPS could outpace the estimates. Alright Degens, here's the play: I'm grabbing some AMZN 10/27 125c @ 2.04 each.  If Amazon rockets just 7%, those calls are hitting pay dirt. üöÄ  Get your war paint on, it‚Äôs earnings season. üé∞üî•,;,; 2023-10-26 16:45:48]

[Apple, Amazon and Coinbase Earnings Today,;,; Today we have a pretty massive line up with earnings, and I wanted to offer my 2 cents for those looking to play either Apple or Amazon  **Apple**  Let's start with AAPL. Apple‚Äôs stock is up over 51% so far in 2023, hitting all-time highs. I honestly see it as a safe haven with strong cash flow, even tho investors have been worrying about slowing demand for consumer goods, including PCs and smartphones. During the call, I'll want to hear about how the current quarter, which ends in September, is shaking out. Apple hasn‚Äôt given guidance since 2020, citing uncertainty, but they will provide us with some data points that they can use to determine whether Apple sees overall sales growing or shrinking. Wall street is expecting   * Revenue: $81.7 billion  &gt; iPhone revenue: $40.2 billion  &gt; iPad revenue: $6.4 billion  &gt; Mac revenue: $6.3 billion  &gt; Other products: $8.3 billion  &gt; Services: $20.7 billion  * EPS: $1.19 per share  The company‚Äôs forecast will be more important. It may give clues as to whether global economies are set up for a ‚Äú[soft landing](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/15/collective-embrace-of-soft-landing-economic-scenario-extends-2023-rally-after-welcome-drop-in-cpi.html)‚Äù after two years of interest rate hikes. The June period is typically Apple‚Äôs slowest quarter of the year, while its fourth fiscal quarter often captures back-to-school laptop spending, a few days of new iPhone model sales ‚Äî which usually come out in September ‚Äî and shows Apple‚Äôs momentum heading into the holiday season.  ‚ÄúWhat will matter most will be management‚Äôs September quarter,‚Äù wrote Morgan Stanley analyst [Erik Woodring](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/erik-woodring) in July, adding that he expects Apple to guide to year-over-year revenue growth again.   I'm eager to see Apple give data points on India sales. Apple CEO Tim Cook traveled to the country in April and spoke about hopes for significant growth in the region. India became one of Apple‚Äôs top five iPhone markets during the quarter.  I don't know if people follow professional analyst notes, but [D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote this week,](https://dadavidson.com/Who-We-Serve/Equity-Capital-Markets/Our-Professionals/ECM-Profiles/ArticleID/1208/Tom-Forte-CFA) ‚ÄúOn the call, we look for additional details on its expansion in India, including its retail and manufacturing presence.‚Äù   But Apple‚Äôs older growth driver, China, is likely to be closely watched as well. Greater China ‚Äî including Hong Kong and Taiwan ‚Äî is Apple‚Äôs third-largest sales region, and it has reported two straight quarters of revenue decline, even as the region reopened after years of strict Covid lockdowns.  ‚ÄúIn our conversations, most investors feel that a soft China could pose a risk to the numbers and further commentary, but we feel that Apple‚Äôs position in China is on a solid footing and that the company is likely to see only a small if any decline in its iPhone sales,‚Äù wrote [Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar](https://www.pipersandler.com/about/people/harsh-kumar). Kumar said if China ends up being weak, it could be offset by strong sales momentum in India.  Apple mainly manufactures in China and investors will want to hear that the company has overcome many of the supply chain snags that have hampered sales over the past two years. If Apple stockpiled parts and has enough to make what it needs to produce, it could help margins.  Maybe people are tired of me tossing random names in the air, but a lot of these analysts are paid to do the heavy-hitting research, so it's only beneficial to read up on what they say. J.P. Morgan analyst [Samik Chatterjee](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/samik-chatterjee) thinks it is time to start viewing Apple in a new light, and I agree with this sentiment. Rather than seeing the tech giant as a product cycle company, it should be seen as a ‚Äòresilient earnings compounder.‚Äô  ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs diversified revenue drivers within Hardware, as well as the natural diversification of the replacement cycle for hardware product on account of a ~2 bn installed base of devices has moved the company incrementally away from being dependent on a product cycle relative to iPhones or any other hardware,‚Äù the analyst opined.  Moreover, the Services segment has grown significantly over time and is now well diversified in terms of its drivers, allowing it to achieve double-digit growth (excluding currency impact) even during challenging economic times. This ‚Äúinherent diversification‚Äù positions the company next to other ‚Äú‚Äôearnings compounders‚Äô with resilient drivers.‚Äù  It also makes it easier to justify the premium multiple the stock has been trading at for the last six months, one which it is likely now to hold on to. Apple‚Äôs profitable services division includes monthly subscriptions such as Apple Music, warranties under AppleCare, fees from the App Store, advertising revenue from search licensing agreements with Google, payments from Apple Pay and other products. I'd like to see Apple‚Äôs services business grow regularly and smoothly, because the margins on services are so much higher than when Apple sells hardware. In particular, many analysts want to see services re-accelerate after a few quarters of weak growth because of lagging App Store software sales.  Apple suggested a 5.5% year-over-year increase in services](https://www.pymnts.com/apple/2023/apples-services-segment-slows-to-5-5-growth-rate/), and [FactSet‚Äôs](https://www.factset.com) estimates more than $20.7 billion in revenue. In fact, given the fact Apple is ‚Äúwell positioned to drive higher confidence from the upcoming earnings print as an ‚Äòearnings compounder‚Äô that continues to drive resilient performance,‚Äù Chatterjee thinks a new price target is due.  As for what to look out for in the report, Chatterjee expects the major highlight will be the pivot back to revenue growth on a year-over-year basis in F4Q23 (September quarter), boosted by ‚Äútypical seasonality‚Äù in the majority of the business‚Äô segments but with an additional kick from ‚Äúmoderating currency and improving Services growth rates as advertising rebounds.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe return to growth will mark Apple cycling past the most uncertain macro backdrop with resilient revenue and earnings, and well positioned to drive robust growth in a normal macro,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúFor the Services business, we expect year-over-year revenue growth to accelerate from the +5% level expected in [fiscal third quarter,] with our checks suggesting online advertising has improved,‚Äù [Deutsche Bank analyst Sidney Ho](https://stockanalysis.com/analysts/sidney-ho/) wrote. But analysts will want to see Apple signal more growth than that.   We also need to keep in mind, Apple's AI acceleration. These analysts will also likely ask about artificial intelligence, given the industry wide obsession with the technology. There's also been a recent [Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-19/apple-preps-ajax-generative-ai-apple-gpt-to-rival-openai-and-google) that Apple is developing a ChatGPT-like AI model internally. Don‚Äôt expect Apple to gush about what it‚Äôs working on internally, though. ‚ÄúWith the official intro of Vision Pro, we expect Apple‚Äôs updated comments on its AI aspirations to be a focus (albeit likely very high-level),‚Äù wrote [Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers.](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/aaron-rakers)  Apple reports its results by product line, which can give us a look into which businesses are thriving and which ones are in a down cycle. IPhone, iPad and Mac sales are all expected to be down on an annual basis, with iPad sales projected to drop nearly 11%. Wearables, the product category with headphones and Apple Watch ‚Äî and what will likely be the reporting category for Vision Pro when it goes on sale ‚Äî is projected to decline less than 1%. However, the experts expect Apple‚Äôs services business to grow 5.2% on an annual basis, which would be a bright spot for the report.  Given these details, I'm fairly sure AAPL calls will be the play today, but with high IV, I'm gonna grab a spread. I can buy the 8/4 192.5c for $300 and sell the 195c for $196. This means I can grab the spread for $104 each. Ideally, if AAPL were to go up just 1.8%, this means the spread can be sold at 140% profit.    **Amazon**  Okay, next is AMZN where analysts are predicting an earnings of $0.35 per share, significantly better than the loss of $0.200 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. In terms of sales, they anticipate an increase of 8.46% over the prior year quarter. For revenue, we expect them to report $131.49 billion. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts forecast a profit per share of $1.61. Data from [refinitiv](https://www.refinitiv.com/en).  While revenue growth remains steady at Amazon, [it‚Äôs been stuck in the single digits](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/20/amazons-post-bezos-experiment-hasnt-gone-exactly-as-planned.html) for five out of the past six quarters. That trend is expected to continue, as analysts are looking for 8.5% growth in the second quarter and a number just slightly higher in the third period.  I believe Amazon‚Äôs expanding Amazon Web Services (AWS) will have a large impact on its second-quarter performance. Amazon Web Services has been a growth driver for years, but the pace of expansion is slowing as customers clamp down on spending due to an uncertain economic outlook. In the first quarter, AWS sales increased roughly 16%, the slowest growth since 2015, when Amazon began breaking out cloud revenue.   In the second quarter, AWS made its purpose-built security data lake, called Amazon Security Lake, generally available. The service aids in the simplification of compliance monitoring and security data management across hybrid and multi-cloud environments by centralizing an organization‚Äôs security data across AWS environments. It introduced a new configuration for Amazon Aurora, namely Amazon Aurora I/O-Optimized, which provides improved price performance and predictable pricing for I/O-intensive applications. It unveiled three new capabilities for its threat detection service called Amazon GuardDuty - GuardDuty EKS Runtime Monitoring, GuardDuty RDS Protection and GuardDuty Lambda Protection. AWS also announced the general availability of its no-code service, called AppFabric. I expect all these initiatives to have helped Amazon win customers. This, in turn, is expected to have boosted AWS‚Äôs second-quarter revenues, whose consensus mark stands at $21.49 billion, up 8.9% from the year-ago reported figure.  However, Brian Olsavsky (Amazon‚Äôs finance chief) warned in April that the company expects to see more of the same in the second quarter in cloud. In addition to cloud, profit margins will be an area of emphasis for investors, as well as artificial intelligence, a focus for companies across the sector.  ‚ÄúThe key question will be whether management suggests that with the timing of the optimization cycle, AI workloads, and easing comps that AWS is likely to start showing revenue growth acceleration beginning in Q3,‚Äù analysts at [Evercore](https://www.evercore.com), who have the equivalent of a buy rating on Amazon, wrote in a note this week. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know.‚Äù  AWS rivals Microsoft and Alphabet last week reported solid results in their cloud businesses, beating analysts‚Äô revenue expectations. But both companies said they continue to see organizations moderating their cloud spend.   Last week, Amazon hosted an AWS Summit, where the company announced updates related to generative AI, including a service that uses the technology to transcribe and summarize doctors‚Äô patient visits. Amazon‚Äôs results will give investors a sense of whether the company‚Äôs ongoing cost-cutting efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Evercore analysts said they expect to see improving margins in Amazon‚Äôs retail business in the second quarter, as ‚Äúcomps against ‚Äô22‚Ä≤s massive cost spikes, capacity utilization recovers, and newfound efficiencies from the regionalization of Amazon‚Äôs retail operations kick in.‚Äù  Recent data released by the company showed improving delivery speeds and efficiencies in Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment network. The company said it‚Äôs made significant headway on its efforts to establish one- and same-day delivery as the standard for Prime members, while also bringing costs down. Also during the quarter, Amazon hosted its annual Prime Day discount bonanza, which they claim as its ‚Äúbiggest ever.‚Äù Amazon‚Äôs guidance for the third quarter could give a glimpse into how much Prime Day lifted sales.  Amazon‚Äôs advertising business is becoming increasingly important to the company‚Äôs financials. Several industry surveys have indicated a slow rebound in the digital ad market may be underway. Meta showed better-than-expected results last week, but rival Snap fell short of sales expectations and gave a weak forecast for the current quarter.  With Amazon's earnings, it's certainly a toss up. But I'm learning bullish. I'm gonna go ahead and do another call spread, getting AMZN 130c at $380 a pop, and selling the 135c at $195 each. This means I can grab the spread for $185 each. If AMZN were to go up with earnings, just 4.8%, this play will profit 170%.   **Coinbase**  Last and certainly least, there's Coinbase. I don't know if anyone rememebers but the SEC [sued the crypto exchange](https://blockworks.co/news/sec-sues-coinbase) not too long ago. The lawsuit is in regards to them allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange.   At today's earnings, investors are gonna be listening to hear about trading volumes and adjusted EBITDA. Coinbase improved its net loss from $557 million during the fourth quarter of last year to $79 million in the first three months of 2023. The exchange generated $284 million in adjusted EBITDA ‚Äî earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ‚Äî last quarter compared to a $124 million loss in the prior quarter.   ‚ÄúUnlike last quarter [when] we saw potential upside going into the print, this quarter is the opposite,‚Äù said [Owen Lau](https://sps.columbia.edu/faculty/owen-lau), an executive director at Oppenheimer and Co. Lau mentioned that he estimates Coinbase‚Äôs trading volume will have fallen 34% quarter over quarter ‚Äî from $145 billion to $91 billion. The exchange‚Äôs adjusted EBITDA could fall about 90% to $29 million, he added.  [Mark Palmer](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/mark-palmer), an analyst for Berenberg Capital Markets, said the [Ripple ruling](https://blockworks.co/news/xrp-ruling-sec) and the prospects of a spot [bitcoin ETF](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/03/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-application-refiled-naming-coinbase-as-surveillance-sharing-partner/) approval have given some investors ‚Äúa false sense of confidence‚Äù about Coinbase‚Äôs prospects.  In addition to weak transaction volumes, Coinbase‚Äôs results are likely to reflect lower interest income from USD Coin (the digital stablecoin). The exchange, which [introduced the stablecoin](https://www.coinbase.com/) with payments company Circle in 2018, offers users rewards by holding USD Coin on Coinbase.  Interest income rose to about $240 million during the first quarter, up from $182 million during the prior quarter. Of that $240 million, $199 million was USD Coin, Coinbase said in its Q1 shareholder letter. But USD Coin‚Äôs market capitalization has fallen by more than 50% over the past year.  ‚ÄúWe see no reason why Coinbase‚Äôs guidance for the balance of the year should be particularly encouraging,‚Äù Palmer said. ‚ÄúWhile interest income on USD Coin has been a tailwind for Coinbase since interest rates started to rise, the continued decline in the stablecoin‚Äôs market cap raises real questions about the extent to which that income will support its operating performance going forward.‚Äù  Morningstar Analyst [Michael Miller](https://www.morningstar.com/authors/2412/michael-miller) said he will be paying particular attention to Coinbase‚Äôs expenses and non-trading revenue sources. So will I. The exchange‚Äôs operating expenses fell to $896 million in the first three months of 2023, a 24% drop from the previous quarter. The figure represented its lowest level of expenses since the first quarter of 2021.   ‚ÄúCoinbase has signaled that it‚Äôs pulling back on its investment spending during weak cryptocurrency markets and what it chooses to continue to invest in will indicate what it sees as priorities,‚Äù Miller mentioned.   Still, Coinbase said in its May shareholder letter that it expected second quarter expenses to increase due in part to higher legal expenses. Miller said he is also keeping an eye on any momentum Coinbase reports related to reducing its reliance on transaction fees.   Coinbase‚Äôs so-called subscription and services revenue, the bulk of which was interest income last quarter, also includes blockchain rewards from staking and custodial fee revenue. Combined, the category brought in about $362 million last quarter, compared to $375 million of transaction revenue.     ‚ÄúCoinbase being selected to provide custodial and surveillance services for a potential Blackrock ETF is a win on this front,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut it remains to be seen how much subscription and service growth Coinbase can create outside of interest income, which is now facing major headwinds.‚Äù   Guidance around the road forward as Coinbase deals with the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit could be helpful as well. The SEC has said it would oppose any motion brought by Coinbase seeking to dismiss the commission‚Äôs lawsuit. Honestly, any update related to Coinbase‚Äôs regulatory issues would very interesting but I‚Äôm not really expecting anything material to come out with earnings.  As a result of my research, I'm just gonna go ahead and get puts. COIN 8/4 90p is $420, and the 85p is trading at $242. Which means I can get a put spread for $178. Like the previous plays, I'm buying the more expensive contract, and selling the cheaper one as a hedge. If the stock were to drop 7.1%, this spread will profit 181%.,;,; 2023-08-03 19:33:44]

[Well shit I guess puts on Amazon,;,; Looks like Amazon is going to plummet‚Ä¶,;,; 2024-01-10 20:36:37]
[Why I think Amazon is a Buy Despite Growing Competition from Shein and Temu,;,; **Rising Challenges for the Everything Store**  The once-dominant position of Amazon as the 'Everything Store' is facing challenges from low-cost competitors like Temu, Shein, and TikTok, which are gaining popularity globally.  **Amazon's Evolving Strategy**  Amazon, recognizing the threat, is evolving its strategy to maintain its position. However, it faces a delicate balance between staying competitive and preserving profit margins, which have become crucial for investor confidence.  **Strengths and Recent Developments**  Diversification into Advertising: Amazon's move to integrate advertising into Prime Video could bolster its already substantial ad business, generating nearly $44 billion annually. Analysts estimate potential incremental video ad revenue of over $2 billion next year.  **Financial Performance:**  Amazon's financial performance is improving, with an expected 11% revenue growth for 2023, compared to 9% in 2022. Operating income is projected to reach $34 billion, reflecting a record-high margin of 6%.  **Challenges from Competitors:**  Chinese players Temu and Shein, specializing in affordable products, pose a threat with rapidly increasing shipments in the U.S. TikTok, with its integrated shopping and ambitious e-commerce goals, adds to the competitive landscape.  **Striking a Balance**  Fee Adjustments: Amazon has adjusted fees for its third-party business, reducing commissions for sellers of low-priced apparel. This move is seen as a response to compete with Temu and Shein. Striking a balance is crucial to remain competitive without compromising profit margins.  **Core Business Focus:**  While Amazon diversifies into various segments, its core business of online retail remains vital. Balancing growth and avoiding single-digit growth challenges are critical to sustaining its position.  **Profit Margins and Investor Expectations**  **AWS vs. Overall Profit:**   While Amazon Web Services (AWS) commands a significant operating margin of 29%, contributing substantially to revenue, Amazon's companywide margin was impacted in 2022. The challenge is to balance the highly profitable AWS with the broader business.  **Stock Performance:**   Amazon's stock price surged by 81% in the previous year. Wall Street expects a strong bottom line, with a focus on 'Harvest Mode' to maintain high margins and stock outperformance in 2024.  **Analyst Outlook:**   Analysts anticipate 36% annual growth in operating income over the next three years, contrasting with 11% annual revenue growth. The emphasis on 'Harvest Mode' reflects a shift from lower-margin investment phases in Amazon's history.  **Conclusion: Navigating Challenges for Future Growth**  As Amazon faces growing competition and strives to maintain profitability, its strategic moves and emphasis on high-margin segments become crucial. The balance between staying competitive in the retail landscape and satisfying investor expectations will determine Amazon's trajectory in the coming years. Cheap alternatives alone may not be enough to unravel the Everything Store, given Amazon's extensive fulfillment network and the loyalty of its Prime membership base.,;,; 2024-01-29 20:11:14]

[Amazon Balancing On The Edge - Will It Lead Anywhere?,;,; So, the story is that Amazon's been in a tight spot since 2019, dealing with one investigation after another. Each hit caused a blow to $AMZN. But at least the government's taking some action, and the House Committee on the Judiciary also joined all this digging into Amazon.  In short, it all started in 2020 when articles from CNBC, Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal with investigations started dropping, causing stock falls.   The grand finale came in October 2020 with news about the FTCS, triggering another stock drop. And that's how 2020 ended, with Amazon in the headlines.   Then, in 2022, the Wall Street Journal came out with an article about the SEC investigating Amazon, and (surprise) $AMZN fell once again.  Throughout all this, Amazon kept silence about any risks tied to their shady moves. And finally investors [filed a lawsuit](https://11thestate.com/cases/amazon-investor-suit) against them, and it's Washington deal now.  Now, after this whole saga, what's your take?

[EU cites anticompetition concerns for iRobot and Amazon Merger,;,; After rumors about a source close to European commission claimed that the iRobot merger was close to regulatory approval last Friday, the European anti-trust regulatory agency issued a statement on concerns about iRobot giving Amazon too much data on its consumers.   Amazon had originally agreed in August 2022 to acquire iRobot for 61 USD per share all cash, with the price being amended to 51 USD per share after iRobot borrowed money to cover operating expenses.   The stock went from 30 USD a share to as high as 42.9 USD per share on Friday. It has since returned to 34 USD per share.   Prospectuses claim that the iRobot Merger deadline is set at February 08 2024 by Amazon and iRobot, and can be extended 6 months upon mutual agreement. The EU however has set a deadline for making an antitrust decision on this merger at February 14 2024 to intentionally confuse investors.  I should have took this as a sign that there would be frequent pumps and dumps on iRobot stock.   &amp;#x200B;  In order for the merger to close before the deadline, iRobot and Amazon needs to secure EU approval and CIFUS certification. CIFUS certification must be obtained before day 45 of any official foreign/domestic level 2 probe into a merger, and may extend investigations by 15 days under extenuating circumstances.  1. No draft is necessary for this case, so Amazon and iRobot are already saving 28 days. 2. The agency will take 2 weeks to review the materials and ask for any additional documentation. 3. CIFUS had already done a 45 day initial investigation during September - October 2023.  4. CIFUS will ask Amazon to respond to inquires after 45 day period , and provides a 3 business day window for a response, December 02 latest.  5. Upon the scheduling of a hearing to appeal the European Commission's decision, CIFUS will extend its investigation by 15 days, not including the 15 days for which the US President has an opportunity to block a deal for National Security reasons.

If not, the EU may become more lax and wait until as late as February 02 to approve the deal, since it is no longer urgent to finalize the deal before the end of 2023.   &amp;#x200B;  The European Commission published its press release on the link below indicating that Amazon has an opportunity to appeal its decision with a closed-door hearing.

[Washington prepares for war with Amazon on mergers, antitrust, privacy and more,;,; The Biden administration is planning to take action soon on at least three of its half-dozen investigations of Amazon ‚Äî moves that could lead to a blitz of litigation to rein in the iconic tech-industry giant.  The FTC has been investigating the internet titan on multiple fronts dating at least back to 2019, looking into its abuse of power within its online marketplace, as well as potential consumer-privacy violations connected to its Ring cameras and Alexa digital assistant.  The agency is also reviewing Amazon‚Äôs purchase of robot vacuum maker iRobot. Any suit against Amazon would be a high-profile move by the agency under chair Lina Khan, a Big Tech skeptic who rose to prominence with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in.  Although Amazon has already been hit by local antitrust suits in Washington, D.C. and California, the coming federal cases would be the most significant challenges to the global company yet. The exact timing of any cases or settlements is unknown.  POLITICO spoke to more than 10 people with direct knowledge of the investigations by the FTC‚Äôs competition and consumer protection teams to put together a comprehensive picture of how the agency is now pursuing Amazon, why it didn‚Äôt take action on the company‚Äôs most recent major acquisition of One Medical and what is likely to happen in the coming months. According to those people, who were granted anonymity to discuss confidential investigations:  The FTC is currently weighing whether to challenge Amazon‚Äôs $1.7 billion acquisition of robot vacuum maker iRobot, with the agency‚Äôs staff attorneys leaning toward suing to stop the deal according to three people with knowledge of that investigation. That case could come in the next few months. It has at least two open privacy investigations, one into Amazon‚Äôs Ring camera and security system business, and the other into its Alexa voice assistant over potential violations of the Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act, according to four people with knowledge of those cases. The result of at least one of the FTC‚Äôs privacy investigations could come in the next couple of months, one of the people said. FTC staff previously recommended filing a lawsuit over alleged privacy and data security violations at Ring before Khan started. Also potentially coming in the next few months is a wide-ranging antitrust case targeting Amazon‚Äôs retail operations, multiple people with knowledge of the probe said. Though the details of a complaint are not known, it could include the bundling of services through its Prime subscription business and its use of competitor data to out-muscle rival retailers on its platform, according to some of those people. The FTC has been investigating nearly every aspect of the company‚Äôs business since 2019, and a lawsuit has long been expected. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that an antitrust case could be filed against Amazon in the coming months. The FTC is pursuing a so-called ‚Äúdark pattern‚Äù probe into the difficulty customers have unsubscribing from Prime and other services. Dark patterns are deceptive tactics used by websites to trick users into doing things like subscribing to a more expensive service than they intended. It is also conducting a deceptive advertising probe into the ‚ÄúAmazon Choice‚Äù label the company gives certain products on its marketplace. The FTC is investigating how that label is used to promote products that appear in search results, including whether it is pay-to-play. Amazon maintains it is not. Nicholas Thompson interviews David Limp onstage. Hold the satellite subsidies. A top Amazon exec is more worried about space junk. BY JOHN HENDEL Representatives for the FTC and Amazon both declined to comment on the investigations.  The lack of action so far shows the difficulties facing the agency in taking on a company as multifaceted as Amazon ‚Äî and suggests the FTC is picking its cases with caution, according to some of the people, who are familiar with the agency‚Äôs strategy.  The FTC has sued Amazon before, accusing it of illegally withholding tips from some delivery drivers. The company settled the case and paid almost $60 million to reimburse drivers.  Top enforcement officials in the Biden administration have aggressively gone after corporate mergers and tech firms in the past year. The FTC last year sued to block Microsoft‚Äôs $69 billion purchase of Activision, and the Justice Department has two separate lawsuits against Google over its search and advertising businesses in addition to preparing an antitrust case against Apple.  The FTC is also coming off a loss in its case to block Meta‚Äôs acquisition of a popular virtual reality app. While the judge in the case validated the FTC‚Äôs novel theory that it could be illegal for companies to acquire, rather than build, a product, he also said the agency did not have the facts to support its claims.  In that environment, the FTC is under immense pressure to bring a successful antitrust case against Amazon ‚Äî particularly after letting two of the company‚Äôs largest deals through without opposition in the past year, according to agency insiders and observers.  Amazon closed its $8.5 billion purchase of MGM Studios in March 2022, with the agency‚Äôs hands tied as its four commissioners at the time deadlocked along partisan lines on whether to intervene. Then last month, the agency elected to pass on challenging the company‚Äôs $3.9 billion purchase of the primary care provider One Medical despite agency officials‚Äô belief that the deal was anticompetitive, according to three people with knowledge of the agency‚Äôs decision.  The rumble over Roombas  Most of the FTC‚Äôs Amazon investigations were launched during the Trump administration, when Republican chair Joe Simons began a broad oversight push on tech giants.  One exception is the $1.7 billion iRobot deal ‚Äî along with One Medical ‚Äî which was announced in August 2022.  The agency has not yet concluded its investigation of the deal, and is continuing to collect documents and testimony from third parties, five of the people with knowledge of the review said.  FTC staff do not believe that Amazon, the leading online retailer in the U.S., should be allowed to buy the largest maker of a popular product sold on its platform, the people said.  Among its issues, those people said, the agency is concerned that Amazon will favor iRobot‚Äôs Roombas over competing brands of automated vacuums such as Samsung. The FTC is also concerned about how the addition of iRobot will add to the control Amazon has in the broader market for connected home devices. Amazon also owns the home security company Ring, and makes the popular voice assistant Alexa and Echo smart speaker. And the FTC is asking whether Amazon would withhold Roombas from competing retailers altogether.  The FTC has also asked how the deal would increase Amazon‚Äôs control over consumer data, as well as potential privacy harms, but that is not the main focus, according to some of the people.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working cooperatively with the relevant regulators in their review of the merger. We have no plans to operate iRobot differently than how they operate today in regards to its availability through other retailers,‚Äù said Amazon spokesperson Curtis Eichelberger. ‚ÄúWe will continue to supply other retailers and vendors with iRobot products, and continue to sell other products on Amazon.com.‚Äù Amazon also plans to maintain iRobot‚Äôs interoperability with other voice assistants, Eichelberger said.  Amazon has been largely unresponsive to the FTC‚Äôs investigation so far, refusing to turn over information requested by the FTC, some of the people said.  For a targeted company, this can be a strategy to run out the clock: Merger reviews are governed by strict statutory time restrictions. In an in-depth review of a merger, the government has 30 days to decide whether to sue once a company meets all the investigative demands. Companies often agree to give the FTC or Justice Department more time, but Amazon has made no such concession, sources said.  In this case though, the FTC likely has time, given the companies also need approval in the EU and UK before they can close their deal. Those reviews are still in the early stages.  An iRobot spokesperson did not respond for comment.  Roomba robot vacuums made by iRobot are displayed on a shelf. The FTC is currently weighing whether to challenge Amazon‚Äôs $1.7 billion acquisition of robot vacuum maker iRobot, with the agency‚Äôs staff attorneys leaning toward suing to stop the deal according to three people with knowledge of that investigation. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Why the FTC didn‚Äôt try to block the One Medical deal  One reason for FTC‚Äôs lack of action on Amazon so far, say experts, is that it‚Äôs technically very hard to bring cases against tech giants, either for enforcers or private plaintiffs ‚Äî in part because they control all the data that enforcers need to build a case.  ‚ÄúThe platforms have an enormous information advantage and unique access to the evidence that the government or plaintiffs need to meet their burden of proof,‚Äù said Amanda Lewis, in Senate testimony this month. Lewis is a partner with Cuneo, Gilbert and Laduca, and previously worked at the FTC and as a Hill staffer on tech and antitrust issues.  Another illustration of the difficulty is the most recent antitrust case the agency didn‚Äôt pursue against Amazon: Its $3.9 billion purchase of One Medical, a primary care company providing access to doctors through individual and corporate subscriptions.  The FTC extensively investigated the One Medical deal and found evidence of anticompetitive behavior that many at the agency considered damning, but ultimately cleared the deal because they saw it as too hard of a case to win, according to multiple people with knowledge of the agency‚Äôs thinking.  That evidence includes Amazon‚Äôs decision to abruptly end lengthy negotiations to poach some of One Medical‚Äôs corporate customers with cheaper pricing in favor of killing off its competing Amazon Care service and acquiring the company, those people said.  In one instance, Amazon was trying to lure the ride-hailing company Lyft to sign a deal for its own health care service, according to three people with knowledge of Lyft‚Äôs testimony during the merger review. Amazon offered to substantially undercut One Medical on price and offered a national network of doctors ‚Äî but when Lyft was ready to sign with Amazon, the retail giant announced its takeover of One Medical, pulled out of negotiations with Lyft, and then said it was shutting down Amazon Care, the three people said.  A spokesperson for Lyft declined to comment.  Other companies had similar testimony, two of the people said. Though many FTC staffers saw that behavior as anti-competitive and illegal ‚Äî acquiring a competitor rather than competing on the merits ‚Äî the agency ultimately decided it would be too challenging to define exactly what market Amazon was monopolizing, some of the people said.  ‚ÄúWe decided independent of, and prior to, the One Medical acquisition, that the Amazon Care offering and business model wasn‚Äôt going to work long-term,‚Äù Eichelberger said.  For the FTC, time is not on their side. With just 19 months until the election and a potential change in administration, it‚Äôs in the agency‚Äôs interest to move on these cases as quickly as possible, lest priorities change in a new regime.,;,; 2023-03-21 23:12:55]

[Your lotto play for AMZN's earnings tonight,;,; So yesterday I told everyone to buy [META calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/) before earnings and it was a straight banger with the stock up 15% after earnings. The day before? [MSFT earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/), posted it before market close. Those who followed either times made big money! What's today's post? Let's take a look at Amazon (AMZN) which is set to release its earnings report today after the closing bell. Can we do it again? Let's see. We're all eagerly waiting to see the tech giant's financial performance for the first quarter of 2023. With a gain of 23% year to date, way above the 7% rise in the S&amp;P 500 index, Amazon has been one of the better-performing names within the tech sector. We want to know if daddy Bezos can maintain his strong momentum.  I expect the company to top the consensus estimates of earnings and revenues. Amazon outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 9% to $149.2 billion. It was due to a 13% rise in North America revenues and a 20% improvement in the Amazon web services segment. That said, the positive impact was partially offset by an 8% drop in international division revenues. I fully expect the Q1 result to be on similar lines.  Trefis estimates Amazon‚Äôs valuation at [$134 per share](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/AMZN/no-login-required/p5DVYQLL/Amazon-AMZN-Valuation-Is-AMZN-Stock-Expensive-Or-Cheap-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230427), which is 22% above the current market price of around $110.   **Revenues expected to top the estimates**  [Amazon‚Äôs revenues grew 9% y-o-y](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/AMZN/no-login-required/HcytK2Km/Amazon-Revenues-How-Does-AMZN-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=trefis230427) to $514 billion in FY2022.  * The company witnessed positive growth in net revenues from physical stores (11%), third-party seller services (14%), subscription services (11%), advertising services (21%), and AWS (29%) divisions. We expect the same pattern to continue in Q1. * The net sales from the online stores category marginally decreased in the year to $220 billion. We expect the same trend to continue in Q1. * Overall, we forecast Amazon‚Äôs revenues to touch $560 billion for the full-year 2023.  The estimates follow that Amazon‚Äôs fiscal Q1 2023 net revenues to be around $125.99 billion, slightly above the $124.54 billion consensus estimate.  **EPS is likely to beat the consensus estimates**  Amazon Q1 2023 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.22, 5% above the consensus estimate of $0.21. The adjusted net income decreased from $33.4 billion to -$2.7 billion in FY 2022. It was partly due to an increase in operating expenses and partly because of an unfavorable decrease in non-operating income from $13.3 billion to -$18.2 billion. Markedly, the non-operating income primarily suffered because of a pre-tax valuation loss from an equity investment in Rivian Automotive.  We expect the operating expenses to follow the same trend in Q1. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $1.71 and revenue per share of $55.44 for the full-year 2023.  **Stock price estimate is 22% higher than the current market price**  Remember the $134 evaluation? This was using an RPS estimate of around $55.44 and a price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of just above 2x in fiscal 2023. This translates into a price of $134, which is 31% above the current market price. Note that P/E Multiples are based on Share Price at the end of the year and reported (or expected) Adjusted Earnings for the full year.  **What do other Finance Websites Say?**  [TipRanks](https://www.tipranks.com/) also expects Amazon to post strong results. They report that Amazon's cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is likely to remain a significant contributor to the company's overall revenue.  [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/) predicts that Amazon's first-quarter earnings will be driven by its e-commerce and cloud computing businesses. It also notes that AWS (Amazon Web Services) is expected to post revenue of $14.03 billion, representing a YoY increase of 28.6%.   [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/) mentions that in response to an uncertain macro backdrop, management has implemented some aggressive cost-saving measures to boost both profitability and its margin profile. These measures include shutting down unprofitable businesses, reducing its global headcount and reprioritizing resources in an effort to right-size the business. The goal is for amazon (like meta) to emerge leaner and stronger.   For those who don't know the [Tastylive website](https://www.tastylive.com/), they've also provided a comprehensive preview of Amazon's earnings report, highlighting the company's ability to beat expectations in the past. Amazon has a history of surpassing Wall Street's earnings estimates, and it is expected to continue this trend in Q1 2023. However, they also mention potential challenges, such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, that could impact the company's financial performance.  **Amazon Earnings Expected Move**  Take a look at the implied volatility of the options market, we can see what the market perception is on AMZN‚Äôs stock price movement going forward. With an expected move of ¬±$6.55, we are looking at just over a 5% expected move on the current stock price for this earnings announcement, which is not necessarily high for a household name like Amazon. If we were to look further into the June cycle though, we can see that this ¬±$6.55 expected move makes up over 60% of the June cycle‚Äôs expected move, which is a substantial chunk given the circumstances.  AMZN stock is currently trading around $110, and we can see that equidistant out-of-the-money options for the weekly options cycle are trading for around the same price - this tells us that the market is not pricing in any sort of skew for this announcement, which is a perceived high-velocity movement. This basically (unfortunately) offers no indication on whether it's going to move up or down. However, given all the details above, what do *you* think? No seriously, take a moment to think about the information presented before you continue reading and try to think: calls or puts for earnings? We do know that with the stock currently at $110, Amazon's risk-versus-reward profile suggests the stock could produce strong returns in the next 12 to 18 months. *But what about earnings??*  **What to do for today's Earnings**  Given all the considerations above, it would be an absolute degen play to even bother considering going into Amazon for earnings. (Oh.. who am I kidding?( Let's fucking go for it! AMZN 4/28 call spread is looking juicy. Can buy the 115c and sell the 120c for $122. This can offer 4.1x gains if things go our way. Mind you, this is not financial or investment advice - this post is just offering education based on what people tend to look for in a company to make an earnings prediction. In fact, just because I'm posting it, the wall street gods might,;,; 2023-04-27 18:00:07]

[Amazon‚Äôs cloud business is clamping down on managers‚Äô freedom to hire in latest cost control.,;,; Amazon‚Äôs cloud business is introducing new restrictions that limit managers' ability to hire, the latest move by the internet company to keep its costs in check as sales growth slows to the lowest level in years.  In a memo sent to Amazon Web Services (AWS) hiring managers on Tuesday, the company said that all potential hires must now be filtered through a special headcount management system to ensure that they are matched with a specific open position. The in-house tool, called Roster, will act as "the source of truth for approved headcount plans," according to the memo, which was viewed by *Fortune*.  AWS managers must begin using Roster immediately, the memo said. By the end of the month, the memo continued, new features will be enabled in a separate internal recruiting tool "to prevent offers from being extended if a requisition is not matched to a position in Roster."  The changes come as AWS and parent company Amazon move aggressively to cut costs. After sweeping layoffs at the online retailer that affected 18,000 corporate positions over the last several months, Amazon announced another 9,000 job cuts in March, which impacted its prized cloud division. Now, six months after a hiring freeze was instituted and experiencing a decline in sales growth that caused the stock to dip 2% last week, the company is working on controls that create a more disciplined hiring system.  ‚ÄúLike most companies, Amazon makes regular process improvements over time to meet the needs of their customers," Amazon spokesperson Jennifer Flagg wrote to *Fortune*. "Roster is a position based management tool that improves the hiring process across the organization for both candidates and hiring managers.‚Äù  Roster is being deployed by AWS's Workforce Management, the memo said, and is part of a plan to ensure that "all hiring efforts and resourcing aligns to approved business demands by EOY 2023." The memo explains numerous variables that will be considered against hiring managers' "approved headcount plans," which are listed as follows: Builders in Seat (BIS), Pending Starts (PS), and open Requisitions (Reqs).  In Amazon's Q1 earnings call last week, CEO Andy Jassy hyped up the possible impact A.I. would have on the cloud division. At the dismay of shareholders, executives added that AWS so far in April¬†is on track to grow 11%, a significant decline from the approximately 16% growth seen in the first quarter, which itself was a marked slowdown from the 37% growth that AWS achieved at the same time last year.

Dish shares jumped 18% following the news, while shares of Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&amp;T all dropped. (After this story published, Amazon reached out wanting to clarify that Amazon, Verizon and T-Mobile have all denied the rumor that was reported by Bloomberg on June 2. Dish declined to comment. This Industry Voices article is speculation by one industry analyst.)  ## Prime Wireless, powered by Dish?  What had the markets so excited about a potentially transformative tie-up? In a word: timing. The timing could not be more perfect for Dish and Amazon to make each other an offer they can‚Äôt refuse, and for consumers to break away from the retail environment of the big three carriers. Wireless networks, like any other facilities-based business, are monetized through their use and in order to thrive, they need vast numbers of users consuming throughput.  Despite [declining retail customer adoption](https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/dish-drops-another-210k-wireless-subs-2q), Dish‚Äôs wireless efforts to date to field a nationwide 5G network have [just passed 70% coverage](https://about.dish.com/2023-06-15-The-DISH-5G-Network-is-Now-Available-to-Over-70-Percent-of-the-U-S-Population) of the U.S. population and the company has built much of the infrastructure and institutional knowledge necessary to power a nationwide network rollout ‚Äì but only if they can start realizing the benefits of owner economics.  Meanwhile, Amazon, with its giant built-in ecosystem of loyal customers, effortless purchasing and its ability to cross-collateralize ultra-cheap, or even free, wireless service, could be just the catalyst to make that mass customer migration possible. In fact, according to the latest J.D. Power data on wireless customer loyalty, 37% of current wireless customers say they selected their carrier based on price.  Among Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) customers, that rate jumps to 69%.¬†Put another way, 6 in 10 wireless customers of the kind ultimately served by AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Verizon through flanker or other brands like Metro, Cricket and Consumer Cellular are at risk of conquest by a radical Dish/Amazon combo offer.  ## Wireless customers hungry for an alternative  Consider the variables at play: a macroeconomic environment of sky-high inflation where everything feels too expensive and everyone is looking to find ways to cut costs. A ubiquitous digital giant that already has deep customer relationships with nearly every consumer in the country. A hungry and financially motivated outsider that has been plotting a move like this for years. Something new and different in a sea of same. Could these be the beginning of the thread that forces the big three into a model that looks more like what streamers have done to the video subscribers count of cable TV?¬†¬†¬†  While a union of Dish and Amazon does make a lot of sense from a timing and incentivization perspective, those factors alone would not necessarily ensure its success ‚Äì many strategic partnerships have seemed like perfect fits before fizzling out. What makes this potential pairing so intriguing is its clear path to success. Customers already appear to be willing to break free of the big three carriers if the price is right, and that sentiment will only grow stronger if the low-cost carrier is associated with a brand they know and already trust.  Beyond the widespread interest among consumers in switching wireless providers for lower cost alternatives, [eSIM technology](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/esim-cards-faq) has made it even easier for customers to become carrier agnostic. Without physical SIM cards tying customers to the carrier-specific phones, an Amazon/Dish partnership could easily employ a ‚Äútry it, you‚Äôll like it‚Äù strategy deployed through its app to onboard customers in the short-term while angling to retain them for the long haul, all while offering complimentary trials of Amazon/Dish services to boot. Now, what if those prospects were offered to try a Dish-powered wireless network with an Amazon gift card as a kicker?  Amazon has another ace up its sleeve: its existing mesh network. Amazon has already tried to seamlessly connect various customer devices through mesh networks with [Amazon Sidewalk](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/everything-you-need-to-know-about-amazon-sidewalk). Supercharging this connectivity with wireless access network enables a near-term future where a customer‚Äôs Alexa and Echo devices boost the Dish 5G cell phone service with Wi-Fi backhaul. Amazon‚Äôs personal assistant devices are already so ubiquitous that device connectivity would likely be seamless. Forget about more cell towers in residential neighborhoods ‚Äì an inexpensive phone with an Amazon network that could get signal boosts in bad-reception areas of the house would be incentive enough for plenty of customers to switch.¬†  Perhaps most importantly, that‚Äôs two massive, double-digit billion-dollar infrastructure investments (owning an ISP, and building a physical wireless network/acquiring spectrum) that Amazon either already has or doesn‚Äôt have to undertake in order to enter and compete in this space.  ## Where do we go from here?  While Dish likely sees any deal between itself and Amazon as a ‚Äú2024 event,‚Äù according to Chairman Charlie Ergen, it‚Äôs hard to deny that the market conditions make a deal getting done in the near-term a logical conclusion. Two of the big three wireless providers are already vulnerable. Between lagging financial performance, executive shake ups and customer loyalty becoming more and more fleeting, there‚Äôs never been a better time for Amazon and Dish to make a big move. And if it happens, it has a chance to send ripple effects throughout the wireless and retail spaces.  Not everyone agrees, of course. AT&amp;T CFO Pascal Desroches, for one, recently [downplayed](https://www.lightreading.com/broadband/atandt-cfo-likens-amazon-mobile-rumor-to-seinfeld-/d/d-id/785359) the likelihood of an Amazon foray into wireless, saying: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sort of like those of you who watch Seinfeld. It‚Äôs a show about nothing. This was a rumor about nothing.‚Äù  To Desroches point, many crucial details ‚Äì like what effect a deal would have on the price of Prime, what infrastructure would need to be enhanced to handle a vast and unexpectedly quick subscriber increase, how device retailers would be incorporated (or wound down ‚Äì Amazon is among the largest seller of mobile phones on the planet) ‚Äì will have to be ironed out. But this could be a deal that makes too much sense to dismiss completely. One way or another, Amazon is likely to come ([back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Phone)) to wireless faster than you can say, ‚Äúone-click purchase,‚Äù and that could be enough to finally lead Dish to the promised land, too.  **The chart looks like it's going to break out to the upside** üöÄ  https://preview.redd.it/g6jcndpxy0eb1.png?width=2048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fddad9ac7397d15403140c4d45c2fb5f6471ac0  **The FLOAT is 22% SHORT**  **üçã (Is this the next $GME, $AMC, $CVNA, $SIRI?... $DISH has a legit turn around opportunity with $AMZN)**  https://preview.redd.it/d4ibcvm1z0eb1.png?width=1402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5e906c910104319ac19ae85e294cddd4ab313476  **June 2, 2023 rumours surfaced again and you can see the stock reactions below  üëÄ**  https://preview.redd.it/41h3ttx701eb1.png?width=1182&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7200aeaf57ed3f8e730b83f889036a9432c2a31,;,; 2023-07-25 02:45:46]
[Why I believe in Rivian (RIVN),;,; I shall keep this brief as possible because I want to hear everybody's thoughts on this,   Here are some of the main reasons as to why I'm so bullish on Rivian:   \- They have an earnings call coming in Early August    \- Using Amazon's money, they've been able to build the infrastructure for constructing their commercial vehicles + their service vehicles like Amazon's delivery truck, being able to deliver on their contract with Amazon will set them up for future success  \- They're also in talks with Amazon to be able to sell their delivery trucks potentially to other 3rd parties, this opens up another avenue of revenue for them  \- (This one is more of a meme and maybe awareness bias) I keep seeing them around NYC and California and have seen a handful in Miami, I have yet to see a single Ford F-150 Lightning being driven on the road or any other electric truck    \- The cars are fun and people enjoy them and they serve a nice techno-adventure niche (I can totally see many Jeep drivers converting to this for their off road vehicle); they are geared toward a demographic that values high utility vehicles, I think in the next couple of years people will be heavily choosing to buy either a Tesla or a Rivian   \- Converting to Tesla's NACS charging standard by 2025 and adopting the Tesla Supercharger network will be huge as they seek to release their lower price point vehicle the R2, which is rumored to be starting close to 40-60K, and will also possibly convince many people who are on the fence about buying a Rivian over a Tesla.   \- As I saw somebody else on this subreddit mention,  even if the stock returns to it's lowest price point of $12, they still have tangible assets, backing by Amazon, and are actually delivering Electric trucks year over year, for a stock that IPOd at $106, a price of $25 is an absolute steal and I can see it easily going past $40 within the next month.    \- They just had their best quarter ever in 2023, delivering more than 20,000 vehicles  Rivian results year-to-date in 2023:  * Production: 23,387 (up 236% year-over-year) * Deliveries: 20,586 (up 262% year-over-year)     I think this is one of those stocks that people are going to be kicking themselves for not buying more when it was at its lowest point (which I already am).

[$DISH is extremely undervalued,;,; So I got into $DISH because of the Dish guy on here a few days ago, but before buying into it, I wanted to make sure it was a good company and I wasn't buying into trash.   I've bought into FRC, AMC, WISH, SOS, TLRY, RAD and many other meme stocks here, so it's fair to say I'm regarded and I've made and lost a lot of money on my stupid plays but I have told myself I am done playing stupid and I need to invest in better companies.   So despite the news of Dish selling phone plans on Amazon, I looked at their balance sheet, and I feel this is one of the most undervalued companies on the market.   Because many regards here don't look at the balance sheet, let's take a close look.   As of last quarter they have  Cash on hand: $2.54B  Total long term debt: $20.53B  Total liabilities: $35.38B  Total assets $56.562B  Total Shareholder Equity: $18.183B (AFTER debt)  Current market cap: $3.72B  In the last year, they've made over 5 billion in profit, as a failing company, their total profit is less than the market cap of the company. How often do you find a company that has made over 5 billion, offers over 18B in book value, trading for under 4 billion? it's a steal.  A lot of that debt has been added over the last few years as they've built out their 5G network to compete with other providers along with purchasing Boost Mobile from Sprint for $1.4 billion.  As you can see even with what customer base is left after all the cord cutting, and now with the new Amazon deal, they are still a very profitable company. They are trading as if they are going to spiral into bankruptcy, but as of right now unless something changes, they are a profitable company that is able to pay all its debts, on top of that, even if shareholder equity was only $10 billion, it's still trading at 3 times less than it should be, the book value as of right now is over 18 billion, yet it's trading at 3.72B, it's a steal.   I also believe that this is a trial period of Amazon selling their Sim cards and cell phone services through their website, if Amazon sees that they are selling well and doing well through Amazon, I believe Dish will have a good chance of being acquired by Amazon, but I believe Amazon wants to see how well they do first before taking that leap, but even if they do, Amazon would be buying a profitable company, that they could integrate into their own services with Prime Video and a 5G network already built out as most of the leg work has already been done.  Even if Amazon never acquires them and that isn't the play (which I totally believe will happen eventually) the big play here is this, they are still a very profitable company, they realize that they are losing customers at a rapid pace on their Dish network services and they've noticed it for a while, so now they are trying to transition to a cell phone provider while they still are making money from their satellite company to roll this transition out.  Lastly, I do expect a decent earnings here as their last earnings was a disaster with over 552,000 people that left due to a cyberattack that left their entire network down for a week, I believe there will be some decline in the satellite division, but I also expect them to push their new cell phone and 5G net work as the future of the company, as even if they were to sell the network they built out alone with 5G, it would be worth more than the debt and 3.72B market cap this is currently trading at. I believe people will finally see the value that they are bringing to the table and the stock will jump to the $10-12 range.   The IV is also higher on the call side than put side, and it's been that way for a bit, so I think even the hedge funds know this is undervalued and expect it to go higher.   I could be wrong, so do your own DD. I'm holding through earnings and jumping ship if I am wrong.   Position 7,400 shares - yes I'm a bag holder but my DD stands, and I know when to cut my losses, so troll me if you want lol  tl:dr - Dish Network is undervalued, they are transitioning into a new industry and already built a lot of the 5G network out to over 240 million Americans (70% of the population) that alone would be worth it for Amazon or some other big player to purchase off of them. The company isn't going bankrupt, but they're being priced as they are.   Only invest what you're willing to lose... or YOLO idc,;,; 2023-07-28 00:49:24]

[Why I Believe Nvidia Will Continue To Grow For The Remainder of 2024,;,; The Santa Clara, California-based company controls about 80% of high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock market value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023.  As of February 13, 2024 Nvidia has a P/E ratio of 95.24 which may seem high and it totally is understandable. Company seems overweight, compared to competitors such as Intel who have or P/E ratio of 107.63 or AMD 326.41. Compared to competitors they are not as over valued.   Lets compare Nvidia with other companies around its market cap. Amazon has a P/E ratio of 58.16. The difference between Amazon and Nvidia is Nvidia is bound for more growth in the near future with the boom of AI which they control the AI chip market by a crazy 80%. What about their financials, last quarter Nvidia had 18.12 Total Revenue with a net income of 9.24 billion. Amazon had 143.08 billion with net income of 9.88 billion. Nvidia has a huge profit margin of 51.01% compared to Amazon's measly  6.9%. No doubt Amazon is trying to create a bigger net profit margin but so would Nvidia.   Recently Canada had signed a letter of intent to engage in business with Nvidia. Recent CEO Huang discussed that not only is Canada prioritizing AI infrastructure but also Japan, France, South Korea, Malaysia, Italy and Britain. This tells us that countries want to buy these chips from producers around the world which Nvidia are currently leading. Only problem is supply chain issues.  With this kind of demand meeting supply is dificult. Hopefully Nvidia is able to capitalize this and meet this enormous demand with increased prices to maximize revenue.  Nvidia is setting foot in creating energy efficient computing for AI. They are making custom chips for clients such as Meta, Amazon, etc... To become more efficient in specific needs for each clients. This opens up multiple new paths for increased revenue. Not just that Nvidia is creating Gpu's for the consumers which compute the power for AI, of course enough power to game and design.  \---**Major current buyers:**  * **Cloud giants:**    * **Meta:** A major spender, reportedly purchasing billions of dollars worth of H100 chips for their Metaverse ambitions and AI development.    * **Microsoft:** Another big investor, aiming to power cloud services and its Azure AI platform with Nvidia's tech.    * **Amazon:** Utilizing Nvidia chips for their AWS cloud services and internal AI endeavors.    * **Google:** While Google develops its own AI chips, they also leverage Nvidia's technology for specific applications. * **Tech companies:**    * **Baidu:** China's tech giant is reportedly a significant buyer, using Nvidia chips for AI research and development.    * **Tencent:** Another Chinese tech player heavily invested in AI, likely utilizing Nvidia's chips for various projects.    * **Alibaba:** Their spending details are less transparent, but they're likely in the mix due to their extensive AI efforts.    * **Dell:** As a major PC and server manufacturer, they incorporate Nvidia GPUs in their offerings, contributing to Nvidia's sales.  \---**Potential future buyers:**  * **Other cloud providers:** Companies like IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud could increasingly turn to Nvidia chips for their AI offerings. * **Startups and smaller companies:** As AI gains traction in various industries, adoption of Nvidia's technology by smaller players is expected to grow. * **Governments:** For projects in areas like national security, healthcare, and research, governments could become significant buyers.  \---**Global reach, with limitations:**  * Nvidia does aim for widespread sales, reaching numerous countries across the globe. They have customers in various regions, including North America, Europe, Asia, and more.  \---**Export controls and restrictions:**  * However, Nvidia needs to adhere to export control regulations set by the US government, where they're headquartered. These regulations might restrict sales to specific countries or for certain uses.  **Examples of restrictions:**  * In October 2023, the US implemented restrictions on selling their most advanced AI chips to China, aiming to prevent their use for military or other sensitive applications. * Similar restrictions might apply to other countries in the future, depending on evolving policies. * Such restrictions can reduce sales but they weren't selling much to China either way. Now they sell chips with slightly less computing power.  **Upcoming potential announcements (based on rumors and speculations):**  * **GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs:** While not officially confirmed, new consumer graphics cards are expected sometime in 2024 or 2025, likely offering further performance boosts for gamers. * **Next-gen DRIVE autonomous vehicle platform:** Nvidia's self-driving technology is constantly evolving, and the next iteration of the DRIVE platform might bring significant advancements. * **New AI chips:** Beyond the recently released H100, Nvidia is likely working on even more powerful and specialized AI chips for various applications.  With the H200 coming second quarter of 2024.  The biggest worries are geopolitical tensions and export restrictions. Do what you will with this info regards.

[WAYFAIR (TICKER: W) PRICE INCREASE COMING,;,; Mods keep on deleting my posts about Wayfair. I'm not quite sure why, perhaps it's the comments... I'll try again...  **Wayfair (W)**  Wayfair, ticker symbol: W. Please hear my thought process out.. I am making this assessment based on the following factors:  1. Growing Short interest - currently 26% of the stock is shorted. 5-6% is considered normal. 10% is considered very high. Current short term interest is 3x the amount of what is considered high, and could turn into a very lucrative short squeeze opportunity. 2. Strong revenue growth and stabilizing costs. We‚Äôll discuss this further in the DD below. 3. I like the stock - Fortune favors the bold, it‚Äôs the first ones to jump in first who reap the best tendies.  The DD‚Ä¶  **What is Wayfair:**  Wayfair is a leading e-commerce retailer in the home furnishings space - if you own a home, or furnished your apartment, chances are you purchased from Wayfair or stumbled upon their website at some point.  Wayfair Stock Price History:  5-year trading range for Wayfair has been $31 to $340, reaching their all time high post COVID due to an incredible user acquisition and revenue grow while everyone was confined to their homes and renovating home offices for WFH. The decline came in the years following the COVID boom as aggressive management growth initiatives led to increasing overhead and their hockey stick revenue growth charts began to normalize after the COVID boom.  **The Fundamentals:**  Brick and mortar retail regained a large portion of the market share that online businesses originally captured while e-commerce could continue to operate their businesses during COVID and brick and mortars had to keep their businesses closed. I believe the COVID boom on e-commerce in general pushed the growing online shopping trend forward by at least 5-years, forcing many who felt uncomfortable with shopping online to adopt out of necessity. Wayfair seems to have only lost a portion of that COVID market share, we see this with Revenue growth that significantly outpaces pre-COVID 2019 revenues by 30%.  I imagine there is far less home decorating going on tight now as interest rates have risen to cyclical highs and home buying has slowed down.  These two fundamentals describe a short term negative trend - from a peak to trough - and I believe Wayfair is currently in the trough and ripe for a correction soon.  Several analysts have reported the bottoming out of the home furnishings industry - see article from Raymond James analyst dated 2-16-2024 where the stock was upgraded to a STRONG BUY with a price target of $65 for the year ([https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wayfair-upgraded-at-raymond-james-on-compelling-mediumterm-riskreward-432SI-3306362](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/wayfair-upgraded-at-raymond-james-on-compelling-mediumterm-riskreward-432SI-3306362)).  The fed is planning to cut interest rates this year, which will trigger the beginning of the home buying frenzy.  YOY revenue growth for Wayfair has been relatively stable in the range of +/- 5%, but still significantly surpassing PRE-COVID 2019 revenue of 9.15B with an estimated revenue target of 12.2B for 2023 if you account for the average analyst prediction for 2023 Q4 and annualize. This compares to a flat YOY 2022 in 2023, a good sign that the worst is behind us.  **The Technical Analysis:**  Wayfair broke through their 200-day MA on 1/19 and then again on 2/12. It broke through the 200-day MA again on the intra-day trade on 2/16, but closed for the day just beneath it. There is a strong channel formation with support at the $48.25 range and resistance at the $55.25 range. I will be a holder of this stock so long as it does not trade below the $48.25 support level. I believe there is a lot of upside if it breaches the $55.25 resistance level and remains above the 200-day MA.  **Important Events/Dates to look for:**  Wayfair reports revenue for the 2023 Q4 quarter on 2/22 and this is the closing quarter for the 2023 fiscal year. We are looking for revenues on par with 2022 Q4 estimated at 3.1B. Most analyst research I have read anticipate an earnings beat which would be very bullish for the stock. Their recent cost-cutting initiatives (13% global staff layoff resulting in $260M annual cost savings) will materialize in 2024 over the full year. We're looking to hear managements feedback about continuing these cost savings initiatives to return the company back to profitability over 2024 and 2025.  **Additional Fundamentals:**  Wayfair's costs have held them back as large institutional investors and investment banks look for consistent stock profitability otherwise they punish the stock. We see this in Wayfair's largely miscalculated cost increases in 2021 and 2022 to drive market share expansion, leading to a peak loss of ($1.3B) in net annual income. This figure is projected to be around ($600M) for 2023 when they report on 2/22, and it represents greater than a -50% reduction in losses YOY. Coupled with their recent layoffs and cost saving initiatives from the start of 2024, I believe Wayfair is on course to achieve the range of ($300M) to potentially even net positive income on the highly optimistic end for 2024.  Wayfair has been in growth mode following in the early footsteps of their big brother Amazon. The key differences between Wayfair and Amazon is their assortment - Wayfair dominates in the home furnishings space as Amazon has significant challenges with large furniture items in their FC's - there is a reason why Amazon does not offer prime delivery on televisions with screens larger than 55" - they rely on their suppliers to dropship these items along with similar oversized items like furniture that are usually not offered for sale through FBA or PRIME on Amazon. Wayfair is also much better than Amazon at selling premium/luxury brands through their AllModern and Perigold sales channels. Wayfair is also exceptionally better than Amazon with their private label initiatives - with dozens or private label brands that allow them to skirt around manufacturer's minimum advertised price policies.  Wayfair has a significant tactical advantage in the Home Furnishings space niche over Amazon. They invested significantly in a 3PL fulfillment model called Castlegate, which charges their suppliers to fulfill orders from Wayfair‚Äôs own FC‚Äôs but ensures speed, quality, service, and sales ranking - similar to the Amazon FBA recipe, but for larger, bulkier home furnishings items. Wayfair has 12 or more of these facilities in the USA that they were opened over the course of the last 5 years. These are not inexpensive to operate, especially in the beginning as Wayfair focused on expanding FC coverage incurring significant costs, while adding vendors to scale the model and reach profitability. I believe the worst is behind Wayfair on this Castlegate program as they have now reached a peak number of FC‚Äôs and strong vendor adaptation - it would be wise to look at Castlegate as a competitive advantage going forward that will lead to higher revenues and drive profitability as Wayfair turns to its vendors to foot the FC bills.  Wayfair advertising - they offer a very robust top shelf advertising program that allows their vendors multiple ways to fund advertising and interact with Wayfair base end users. Again, following in the footsteps of Amazon, digital advertising and PPC models generate at least 15% of Amazon's overall revenues. This is a very high margin business because it uses technology to scale revenue growth. I have personally used and engaged with Wayfairs digital advertising program. It is very good and on par with industry standards for a niche e-commerce retailer when you compare it to the likes of Amazon. Very few competitors in this space offer a similar platform: Amazon, Overstock, and Wayfair, and Wayfair's platform is on par.  Lastly, Wayfair added to the cost cutting measures by two rounds of layoffs - once in 2022 for a 5% global workforce reduction and then again at the start of 2024 for about 13% of their global workforce. In the most recent rounds, on January 19th, Wayfair laid off 13% of its corporate workforce which will result in an estimated 260M in annual cost reductions straight to their bottom line for 2024.  I believe this recent round of layoffs will not impact revenue growth as we are seeing a shift in corporate culture across the board from a resource abundant environment to one that is more lean and mean. Their revenues in 2023 vs 2022 were unimpacted with the 5% layoff in 2022. We are seeing this type of cost cutting behavior all around us in our own places of business and/or by knowing someone who has been recently laid off from big tech.  There are several additional cost cutting levers Wayfair can pull if needed, such as reducing advertising expenses (TV ads, Google Adwords), additional rounds of layoffs, and more. Not to mention their recent switch to Vendor funded returns - meaning the vendor now foots the bill when there is something wrong with the customer's order - this is a new initiative they launched mid-2023 that will result in further savings to their bottom line.  **So here‚Äôs my bottom line‚Ä¶**  Wayfair is expected to report revenue for the 2023 Q4 quarter on February 22nd. I believe revenue will beat analyst estimates as research shows this will likely be the case (I audited dozens of websites, including Seeking Alpha, and independent analyst reports). I believe we will start to see the positive effect to Net Income from these significant cost cutting measures coupled with further benefits from scaling Castlegate and Digital Advertising programs that will be hitting their bottom line. At the very least, these subjects will be discussed on the revenue call with some additional insight and cost-cutting feedback from management that will trigger further institutional buying.  The icing on the cake is the short squeeze opportunity. With 26% of the stock being shorted, we could see exponential movements to the upside if Wayfair delivers a robust earnings call on 2/22 as anticipated and the stock approaches $60+ as short sellers scramble to purchase stock in the open market to close out their short positions.  Of course there are some risk factors - for instance, global macro economic conditions worsening, and the risk of a market correction triggered by negative earnings reports next week from the likes of behemoths like NIVIDIA, WALMART, and HOME DEPOT to name a few...  Full Disclosure: I own 80 April 19 calls valued at $40k and I fully intend to add to this position over the next few days and weeks.  https://preview.redd.it/r7knvoejsdjc1.jpg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8fbf3da1e31e9a7ee56d53bb243dde597e857182,;,; 2024-02-18 17:45:48]

[I understand UBER has really done well in terms of profitability and growth.

I can totally understand this point if you look on paper, especially over the past 1.5 years. It has finally reached profitability after losing about $8B per year for a couple rough periods. That said, its margins are razor thin compared to gross revenue. The argument could be made that it's the next amazon which also has tiny margins but has still grown into a behemoth. I guess my concern is that Amazon has made things cheaper whereas Uber's profitability has come through increasing prices. Uber, and especially uber eats, seems very discretionary, and discretionary things that are only becoming significantly more expensive seems like a problem? Don't get me wrong, I think there is some serious potential here, but I have a tough time really buying into it because if it's business model is like amazon's, it should be getting cheaper and not more expensive...right?,;,; 2024-01-05 04:19:54]

[BlackBerry hits all Time Low - it could be worth a look,;,; BlackBerry is not in the phone business and hasn't been for 6 plus years.   It's in the security business.   It's QNX operating system powers NVIDA's ADAS systems and is in every major car manufacture excluding TESLA.   Their partnership with Amazon on IVY should start to show returns towards the end of this year and could be huge.  BlackBerrys Security division provides solutions to the most of the major Governments, Banks and security conscious companies around the world.  Until BlackBerry shows some growth in earnings which have dropped dramatically due to the loss of phone based recurring revenues and their Cylance division concentrating on the embedded market we probably won't see the stock price start to Rocket for the next 6 to 12 months at the very least.  However there has been a concerted effort to drop the stock price to the new lows and it is incredibly undervalued at these prices.   Even in a complete fire sale the stock is worth 6 plus dollars a share and we are at 2.70 currently.  Currently retail owns over 50pct of the float - that is certainly low hanging fruit that has had the trees shaking.

Nvidia Tesla Meta Microsoft Amazon Apple Google  And we can we can see these companies don't all things in common, but they have a few things.  Platform monopolies: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon. These companies all have monopolies and no one cares and can continue to die wherever they want to print money  Risks:  Google lost their app store monopoly lawsuit   Amazon loses money to run an unprofitable retail business to get a monopoly. Everyone else has comparable offerings to AWS.  Meta and Google: these are social media plays. The easiest way to destroy America or influence it's politics is via Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube. Foreign governments and local politicians all dump money into these platforms to cause civil unrest and pollute minds.  Risks: Eventually America might actually fall and social media won't be useful anymore. Alternatively, America will topple the governments of the countries doing this, such as Russia and China. Low risk of either outcome.  Nvidia and Tesla. Enron style financial scams. These companies play financial shell games and provide lines of credit to shell companies and broke customers so they can buy their products on paper and manipulate their product prices upwards. Thankfully, Enron ran for almost a decade before it blew up and these companies have only a few years of shady finances, 5 at most for Telsa and less for Nvidia. They may blow up, but not today and not tomorrow.  Risks: the super profitable Enron schemes blow up sooner for Nvidia and Tesla than they did for Enron and we enter the second dotcom burst.  As we can see, all of the magnificent 7 are going to print money for the foreseeable future, at least another 5-10 years until a radical wins office and does major overalls of the systems that allow these companies to be super profitable.,;,; 2023-12-19 02:59:42]

[Pinterest (PINS) Analysis,;,; For the next analysis we will be looking at Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) earnings. Pinterest is an image and aesthetic sharing platform popular among younger users. There are many positives about this stock, but certain events lead me to have skepticism. With that being said, let‚Äôs dive into the analysis and see where the stock could potentially head post earnings and in the future.   Description:   Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) is an image and idea sharing platform founded in 2008. It operates on the idea of being a visual discovery engine allowing users to find new aesthetics, recipes, etc. This allows for ample advertising opportunity, as companies can obtain ad space on the website for products. Recently the company obtained a deal with Amazon where they get a portion of sales revenue generated from users interacting with Amazon ads. This has sparked renewed interest in the company as this deal is expected to generate increasing revenues and give opportunity for expansion with other brands. There have been rumors that Pinterest is in talks with Google to expand the brand partnerships, similar to what they are doing with Amazon which could be a great sign for the stock. But a lackluster performance from Snapchat puts a shadow on the upcoming performance from Pinterest. The largest fear is that ad spend is being sent to larger companies like Meta, which was my fear with SNAP.   Financial Breakdown:  LTM Price Increase: $25.88 ‚Äì $40.63 (+57.00%) Users: Q3 2023 ‚Äì 482MM | Q2 2023 ‚Äì 462MM  Revenue increase: +11.49% YoY Q3 and +7.8% Q2-Q3 Competitors: Facebook (META), Twitter, Tiktok  Earnings:  Q3 Reported EPS: $0.28 (+40.42% delta from expected) | Q3 Reported Revenue: $763.2MM (+2.67% delta)  Stock Move: Stock jumped +26.11% after earnings  Q4 Expected EPS: $0.51 | Q4 Expected Revenue: $990.19B  Verdict:   With Pinterest reporting earnings after market close on February 8th, all eyes will be on the health of advertising within the company‚Äôs revenue. This earnings release will be a big one, but the stock will either booming or completely cratering. The way I see it there are two realities, is Pinterest similar to Meta or Snapchat. In my honest opinion, this stock has a long way to go to be compared to Meta. Although both companies share a portion of their revenues to advertising, Pinterest lacks the products and AI infrastructure needed to provide a stable revenue stream. Although the deal with Amazon is good, Snapchat also shares a very similar deal where customers can purchase directly through their app. Because of the vast similarities in how Pinterest produces revenue, I lack the faith to purchase any long positions in the stock. This all comes in the face of a +30% increase since November. ¬†  Prior to providing my opinion, I must preface with a disclosure that options trading is extremely risky and losing all your money is a very real possibility and that this is not financial advice. Whether you elect to agree with my personal decision is entirely up to you, and this post is simply intended to provide more information into the company. As we head into the report, I expect the management team to try and talk about AI influencing/optimizing the ads and products shown to customers. I believe they will be right around the earnings expectations because of holiday spending, but like Snapchat I think there will be concerns about guidance and ad spend. In my own portfolio, I AM STEERING CLEAR ON THIS STOCK. Historically, the stock has seen a ~13% move in either direction post earnings and I don‚Äôt expect this to be any different. I originally purchased 1 call contract but after looking deeper into the company, and the fact that insiders have sold the stock recently, I can‚Äôt help but think about this logically. The closest competitor, Snapchat vastly underperformed and provided terrible guidance. This, on top of insider selling makes me think the market is anticipating a downward move. A director within the company (Jeffrey Jordan) has been selling 20,000 shares a month this quarter which is very concerning. Even if they beat I think the stock will move downwards because of this reason. But again, anything is possible so a move upward could happen if they announce a partnership with Google and mention efficiency improving levers. If I had to pick a direction, I would anticipate an approximate 10% move downward so $41 puts would look inciting where the break even piece would be at $38.00, prices we haven‚Äôt seen since a whopping 1.5 weeks ago. All in all, I am sitting this one out because I see better opportunities in the market.  We have two more earnings to play this week (AFRM, Cloudfare) so expect to see one more post like this one. I won‚Äôt be doing an in depth play on Cloudfare but purchased calls. Please leave a like and comment if you want to see more. Good luck!,;,; 2024-02-08 19:54:36]

Today I sold most of my contracts then bought back in for half that about 5k at close to the end of the day. I was pretty confident they would beat and have good earnings. What do you guys think there worth in the morning 20-24 $. Also thinking of putting this whole play and profit into Amazon earnings tomorrow. I have calls on them already may wanna parlay this option into that. What‚Äôs the consensus on Amazon I feel like they had a strong quarter.,;,; 2023-04-26 23:06:02]
[üöÄAMD Earnings: Time to Hit it Big,;,; So last week [I gave you guys AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17h0sy7/amazon_earnings_the_boomer_play_that_could_print/), the stock went up 7% after earnings and calls printed big time. An absolute banger. Now this week, let me show you what's in store for AMD and look at how we can make money on earnings tonight. Are we gonna see an earnings beat that sends us to the moon, or is it time to deploy the üí© emojis?  Whether its autonomous vehicles, entertainment, or healthcare, AMD‚Äôs processors are powering people and businesses at a cutting-edge level. Yup, that's right; this chip titan's tech is in everything from your mom's car to the PS5 you can't afford. And the company will look to demonstrate how broad its reach is when it reports third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings results after the closing bell Tuesday. We'll want to look to see whether AMD's streak of earnings beats can continue; working in AMD's favor is the noticeable rebound in global PC shipments suggesting that a recovery in the global PC market could be underway.   In the most recent quarter, worldwide PC shipments totaled 59.7 million units, marking an almost 17% decrease year over year. But that decline is showing signs of stabilization, [including sequential growth from the previous quarter](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/04-11-2023-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-declined-30-percent-in-first-quarter-of-2023), noted Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa. ‚ÄúThe rate of decline in the PC market has slowed, indicating that shipment volumes may have reached their lowest point,‚Äù said Kitagawa, then adding, ‚ÄúThere has been progress in reducing PC inventory after more than a year of issues, supported by a gradual increase in business PC demand." In other words; we've hit rock bottom and it's only up from here. With PCs no longer in freefall, AMD's got a shot at keeping its stock price soaring.   Meanwhile, AMD stock, which is up 48% year to date, while the S&amp;P 500's playing catch-up with a measly 7%. This is because even amid the PC decline challenges or past issues related to supply chains, the company demonstrates strong operating leverage evidenced by its ability to grow profits at a faster rate than its revenue. Assuming the company‚Äôs growth metrics rebound in Q3, along with strong guidance, AMD stock will continue to rise despite its recent outperformance. This company can turn a profit faster than you can say "capital gains tax."  The pencil pushers over at wall street are predicting 64 cents per share in earnings on $5.37 billion in revenue. Compare that to 67 cents and $5.62 billion last year, and you've got yourself some bearish vibes. But remember, CEO Lisa Su has hinted at a more bullish $5.7 billion revenue mark. AI demand alone could make this a $150 billion market by 2027.  Artificial intelligence will continue to push the semiconductor industry, and will really help AMD well into 2024 and so on. In the meantime, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann sees the data center's strength helping AMD, especially their new MI300A/X APU/GPU compute accelerators, which could blast Wall Street's expectations. For those who don't know, he's referring specifically to their accelerated processing units and graphics processing units. More on these products later.   Regulations on tech exports to China could be a curveball, but the longer-term outlook is good. PC demand is set to return by 2024, and the GPU market could grow by a crazy 34% annually over the next five years. This is as the data center industry is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 10.5% through 2030.  In the near term, AMD's management needs to tackle the chip industry's cyclical nature, but they've done it before. In the second quarter, the company beat on both the top and bottom lines by a penny, while Q2 revenue of $5.36 billion topped estimates by $40 million. This is despite the 18% year-over-year decline.  The beat was driven by 16% rise in the Embedded segment, which offset declines in Datacenter, Gaming and Client. During the quarter, operating income swung to a loss of $20 million from a year-ago gain of $526 million. But I expect AMD‚Äôs segment growth metrics to rebound in Q3. I'm fairly sure margin pressures have bottomed and are now ready for expansion. Assuming this comes with strong guidance for the holiday quarter. Here, AMD stock will continue to rise even with its recent outperformance.  KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh slapped a $160 price target and an 'overweight' rating, because he sees this rocket fuelling up for a late-year lift-off. He mentions, "Despite modest risk to 4Q guidance given the pushout of MI300A volumes and a more measured Genoa ramp, investors will likely look through any near-term miss in anticipation of a December MI300X launch event and Microsoft onstage endorsement, providing a clear catalyst for the stock into the end of the year."  As traders, will should also look for a detailed impact from expanded restrictions on the sale of advanced technologies to China, unveiled earlier this month by U.S. Trade Secretary Gina Raimondo.  The new restrictions, which expand upon new export rules put in place last year, are designed to limit China's access to "advanced semiconductors that could fuel breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and sophisticated computers that are critical to (Chinese) military applications," Raimondo said.  China‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs described those efforts as "economic coercion and sci-tech bullying" earlier this year and described the moves as "against the principles of market economy and fair competition."  **AMD's Products**  During this last quarter, AMD expanded its FPGA portfolio with the launch of the Alveo UL3524 accelerator card. This is designed for ultra-low latency electronic trading applications. The latest state-of-the-art FPGA solution will help the company expand its footprint in the fintech domain. Fucking amazing.   AMD also expanded its portfolio with the launch of Kria K24 System-on-Module (SOM) and KD240 Drives Starter Kit. The K24 SOM features a custom-built Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC device and the supporting KD240 starter kit is a sub-$400 FPGA-based motor control kit.  They also continued by expanding its fourth-generation EPYC CPU portfolio with the launch of 8004 series processors. These are based on Zen 4c core and a new SP6 socket. For those who don't know, the EPYC 8004 series processors can provide up to two times better SPEC power performance (per system watt) compared with the closest competition. Computerphiles believe that AMD‚Äôs EPYC 8004 series processors deliver balanced performance and excellent energy efficiency that is required at the edge.  In addition to this, AMD unveiled the new Radeon RX 7800 XT and Radeon RX 7700 XT. Anyone in the gaming space? These new graphics cards are optimized to deliver incredibly high-performance, high-refresh 1440p gaming experiences for AAA and esports titles. The company also announced the availability of AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution 3, the next generation of the popular upscaling technology that is designed to offer massive performance boosts in supported games.  And not even that long ago, in August, AMD announced that Amazon Web Services has expanded its 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor-based offerings with the general availability of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) M7a and Amazon EC2 Hpc7a instances.  Moreover, AMD announced two new additions to the Radeon PRO W7000 series product line, the Radeon PRO W7600 and Radeon PRO W7500 workstation graphics cards.  **What do the other Analysts Say?**  * ‚ÄúWe expect slight upside to third-quarter results and a largely in-line-with-consensus fourth-quarter outlook. We believe PC tracked slightly better and data center tracked in line. We are modeling $300-400 million contribution from MI300 GPU in the fourth quarter, primarily from El Capitan supercomputer, which is a one-time project.‚Äù ‚Äî Raymond James analyst Srini Pajjuri  * ‚ÄúAMD‚Äôs calendar third-quarter estimates should be achievable, particularly assuming some benefit from improving consumer PC shipments. The risk rather, in our view, is CQ4 (and perhaps CQ1). The ramp of El Capitan should provide AMD some momentum; however, we are less clear that AMD can hit elevated expectations, which we believe will eventually require better server CPU shipments in light of continued weakness in cloud-service-provider spend.‚Äù ‚Äî Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson  * ‚ÄúThe AMD narrative feels all about their datacenter (and, particularly, their AI story) right now. In the near term the achievability of their second-half datacenter growth (guided to 50% half over half) will be the question (we think the growth into year-end is plausible as most of it is likely from El Capitan but Q1 estimates may bear some watching), though CPU share as Genoa finally hit crossover will also be top of mind.‚Äù ‚Äî Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon  **What to do for Earnings**  Given everything that I've read so far, I'm sure calls are the way to go here. I'll be getting AMD 11/03 100c @ 2.58, the stock will need a ~5% rise to break even. I expect this and more. Keep in mind, this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. On Wednesday, we have ROKU, PYPL, and ABNB. And of course on Thursday, we have PLTR, SHOP, AAPL, COIN, DKNG, and SQ. I'll probably be making two more posts this week.,;,; 2023-10-31 17:10:48]

[Oxy is the most undervalued company based on FCF yield on EV in the market right now.,;,; FCF yield on EV(enterprise value) is 14.66% and Operating CF on EV is 21.7%. This means that if you have 69 Billions to buy Oxy with net 0 cash and debt, after 6.8 years you will have 69 Billions in your bank account. This disregards the value their yearly 1.4B capex will generate.  Using 3.13% FCF yield on EV of AAPL for comparison. If you pay 3 Trillions to buy apple with net 0 cash and debt, it would take you about 31 years to have 3 trillions in your bank account.  Oxy is at the forefront of Direct Air Carbon Capture (DACC) technology. BlackRock has already invested $550m and Amazon is currently working on a contract. The most important part here is that Oxy pumps the captured CO2 down to improve shale extraction by 80%.  Oxy break-even oil price is $40 and the Saudi wants oil to be at $80.

[The end of the world is bullish.,;,; Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's bullish. Think Amazon will miss the next earnings? That's bullish. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Bullish. You think insiders don't already know that?   The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in as bullish decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc.   Anything you can think of is bullish, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. Buy the dip. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe, you guessed it. Bullish).

[Down 21k on Christmas, Update,;,; Originally down $21,202  Dec 26th, 2022.  Held Amazon, Google, Apple for almost a year which helped my climb. Had no more funds to use as Amazon was a huge buy at 88 because I was depositing money weekly just to prevent margin calls on stock. All I had was stock and still down so badly I was on the verge of being margin called.  Fast forward. Sold all my tech a bit early as they all boomed after. Regardless, started doing short 3-6 month calls, apparently these aren‚Äôt called leaps. I hit and missed. But my hits outweighed my misses and I scalped stock by day trading usually 100 shares at a time. I used stop losses for day trading.  Finally got green maybe a month ago and was up $800. I wanted to beat the Spy and VOO lines that Robinhood started posting though. Immediately ended up down. I paid off a wedding ring and transferred 6500 into my IRA. Maxed that out in VOO. But Netflix crushed me. Slowly lost a few 100 a day at best. Ended up down close to 5k on Netflix 12/15 with a 400 strike. Netflix hit on earnings though so I sold for 300 profit with that 5k swing I‚Äôm back in the green again with various other long calls.  Spy &amp; voo charts got taken off Robinhood now. So I wanted to stick around and beat it but I‚Äôm guessing they realized how degen it was. Anyways, I‚Äôm hoping I can make some money Monday so I can go back to scalping stock I like.

[$RKLB Hidden message in PR: Part 2. $AMZN &amp; $RKLB Likely billion dollar deal to be annouced,;,; If you haven't read it already, Here is my first post  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10xlhxa/rklb\_hidden\_message\_in\_new\_pr\_big\_announcement/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10xlhxa/rklb_hidden_message_in_new_pr_big_announcement/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  To sum it up: Rocketlab last week announced that it has signed a contract with a HUGE undisclosed customer for the purchase of its new reaction wheel product (that was designed for this customer) (reaction wheels are an expensive satellite part and mega constellation such as starlink, all satellites need these), and rocketlab built a facility last year to produce these in high volume, each reaction wheel has a retail price of 100-120K each, each satellite needs roughly 4 of them. with each satellite needing to be replaced every 5 years or so, this is a potentially Billions of dollars worth of reoccurring revenue.  ([Rocketlab Builds a massive fucking facility for production of these reaction wheels](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-expands-space-systems-footprint-with-new-high-volume-reaction-wheel-production-facility/))  ([Rocketlab announces new reaction wheel for a "Huge undisclosed mega constellation customer"](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-increases-space-systems-offerings-with-new-products-for-small-satellites/))  Its hard to summarize the whole thing but read my post. I really dig deep in the potential $$  In my post I narrowed it down to be potentially Amazon project Kuipar. which is a huge satellite fleet that would result in Billions of dollars worth of these parts over the next 10 years.  (IM PROBABLY LOSING YOUR INTEREST BECAUSE U DONT KNOW HOW SIGNIFICANT THIS IS, READ TO THE END I PROMISE U ITS WORTH THE TIME)  Well Im fucking doubling down, here is fucking why.  Adam Spice (Rocketlab CFO) a few days ago attended an event and did a presentation on Rocketlab  An investor asked about the new reaction wheels and he answered this and in his response he said two things that caught my eye  "our new 12ms reaction wheel is much bigger than we've ever done and is really targeted towards that one megaconstellation customer we haven't be able to name, but hopefully once they start launching those satellites, we will be able to disclose who they are"  "and now we enter into an agreement with a mega constellation customer, were its THOUSANDS of reaction wheels per year, and much bigger reaction wheels, and what that does is allow us to build a dedicated, high volume production facility in New Zealand"  ([Video of CFO talking about it](https://twitter.com/NutscapesNFT))  Here is the info we ALREADY KNEW about this constellation. (please read my other post or you might be a bit confused as I might reference some info from their)  \-But in a nutshell these reaction wheels are designed only for satellites 600-650KG (this isn't roughly, it NEEDS to be precise),  \-Obviously a large customer if they built a facility + designed new product for this customer  Now here is where Adam Spice fucked up. Just because he is not a satellite expert, does not mean us internet regards aren't. He gave way too much information and I have narrowed it to who it could be  So First off I went through every mega constellation planning to be launched (or already launched and sorted by the size of the satellite from 600-650KG  This really only fucking narrows in down to Amazons project Kuipar (Amazons starlink competitor), this is an abnormally large satellite, the only other sat that resemble the size range include the following (see my other post for exact breakdown)  In the video Adam Spice stated that they have not yet launched their satellites yet, which even further narrows it down to project KUIPAR (they have not launched yet)  Adam Spice also said "once they start launching those satellites, we will HOPEFULLY be able to disclose who they are". THIS IS HUGE, THIS TELLS US THEY CANNOT DISCLOSE. they want to disclose the customer, but they cant  Why aren't they able to disclose it on their own terms?  Because the company they are launching for is a fucking public company.  If it was a private company they sold to, why would the private company give a flying fuck? also they won't be legally bound to not disclose it, it would be THEIR OPTION as manufacturer. (unless the private company made some weird confidentially clause, which would be very unusual and bizzare as a private company.  Aso we already knew it was going to be a huge contract given they made a new product and facility for it, but Adam nailed the cherry on top. "We will be making THOUSANDS OF THESE for this customer"  Now each sat is different but its roughly 4 reaction wheels per satellite, (not much of a range, some could need SLIGHTLY more or less)  Thousands (PLURAL) of reaction wheels PER year IS A FUCKING HUGE FLEET  were talking A BASE Of 250 satellites per year (Its MORE, im just using 1000 per year as a starting)  I went through Wikipedia, looked at all the data from satellite fleet size, if they have already started launching or not, public or private, size of satellites (Mass in KG)  Not only does Amazon project Kuipar meet the criteria for ALL of these facts that we know, but all of them simatenaously. VERY FEW of these satellite fleets meet 2+ of these criteria, I could only find a few other other satellites fleets that even resembled the size (off by 50KG in sat size, but even then its hypothetical as reaction wheels must be put in place for exact size of sat), never mind the other conditions.  Some other honourable mentions include  Telesat constellation which satellites are 150KG oversized, and total fleet wouldn't even need 1000 reaction wheels total.

Also even if its not Amazon project Kuipar, which I really do think it is. There really isn't too many mega constellations planning to be launched anytime soon lol  CFO at least confirmed with us that they will be making thousands of reaction wheels per year for this one mega constellation customer (IM TALKING ABSOULUTE BARE MINIMUM)  He said thousands as in plural  so 2000 reaction wheels  he said per year  so lets go 1 year  1 years of manufacturing 2000 wheels per year for one customer = 200million $  What are your guys thoughts? It seems clear as day to me. Can anyone point to who else this would be, im open to counter arguments?  is it just lack of knowledge on the sattelite parts and space industry the reason this hasn't reacted yet?

[TSLA Calls vanquished my last hope. Had $1k 24 hours ago,;,; &amp;#x200B;  [Was up to 14.5k by end of March, lost most by April 8th](https://preview.redd.it/7n310o2il6db1.jpg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0eaf7ff963a84ec680528bddb1a343e25be7484b)  As the picture shows, i'm down pretty bad. Started in December with just $800 and quickly got addicted to putting my savings in thinking its gonna multiply through easy puts. I honestly wasted all my savings within the first two months not knowing what i was doing, went from $6,800 to $600 to $1,200, and from there starting in March I actually did some good plays day by day on SPY and QQQ. I was calling reversals and everything, but the market also just had a lot of momentum. I reached 14.5k, the most money I've ever had at one time, and thought, dang just $500 more to 15k. I switched from my winning strategy of intraday plays and tried holding UVXY calls, Kroger and Zilllow puts (someone posted here about them) and lost a majority of my money by trying to do the same intraday calls/puts. But in April the market stabilized like crazy, my plays didn't work at all anymore and those puts I had lost so much value. I should have stopped but I got desperate, trying to regain my wealth. Honeslt,y if I had just waited three days and took a break, placed it all in Calls, I would easily have gone above $32k and probably not need to ever touch the market again.  I went to Coachella and missed out on a lot of earnings that i DID want to play, which probably would have boosted me really good. Instead the one Earnings i did play was Amazon. Price went from around 108 to 119 to 102 by open, we all remember that. I stayed outta playing for a bit, got my money up to $700 doing SQQQ puts recently, and then Put in another $300 to buy two Tesla calls at different prices for 7/28. 1k wiped out overnight.   Dumb and stupid choice, I really believed Tesla could break $305. My other friends only played $200-300, buy my dumbass went all in. Seeing 1k again felt so good for a moment. I really dont know what i'm going to do now. I have a lot of debt and basically 0 savings, all my money is just in my checking account going in and out as I get paid. I'm 24 but I feel like a fucking loser cause of all of this. At one point I wanted to take out a $2,500 loan but I was denied.,;,; 2023-07-20 20:54:33]

[RIVN is undervalued and oversold‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm leveraged to the tits üå∞üå∞,;,; Today I want to tell you why Rivian, the electric car company that is best known for moving people down tax brackets, is now a buy.  Scroll to the end if you want the TLDR. Also fyi not a bag holder, my cost basis is $12.60/share ($13.87 now). Full disclosure, I'm leveraged to the tits on this trade.  &amp;#x200B;  # Trading Below Net Assets  Rivian has fallen 90% since its IPO at the end of 2021.  Rivian‚Äôs market cap is now only $13b. It has $12b of cash on hand and $14b in shareholder equity (assets minus liabilities). Its existing factory will be able to produce 150k vehicles/year when fully operational, at $75k/vehicle that will generate $11b in revenue. Its second factory is already in the works to build the next generation (R2), which will be cheaper.  For comparison, Tesla is trading 11x shareholder equity and 6.4x revenue. Tesla is a better company but not a better stock.  &amp;#x200B;  # Rivian Actually Makes Great Cars  Marques Brownlee reviews (big tech review guy) [owns one and likes it](https://youtu.be/wR-0knMVSGw). Even its detractors say its handling is unmatched in the EV space. The SUV pickup space is the hottest sector in the US car market.  Demand for EVs is massive and will grow exponentially over the next decade. Making vehicles that look great, handle great and have some nifty features is more than enough to sell everything you can make. Rivian has years of orders with little to no marketing.  There's not too much competition, Cybertruck looks weird and isn't available yet, Ford F150 Lightning is being made in very small amounts.  They‚Äôve also gone after the delivery van space with an exclusive deal to supply Amazon. Electric vans make more sense than semi-trucks, as road weight limits reduce carrying capacity due to the weight of battery packs.  &amp;#x200B;  # RJ Scaringe Doesn‚Äôt Have To Be A Rocket Scientist  The CEO of Rivian, RJ Scaringe, isn‚Äôt a grandstanding visionary. He‚Äôs slightly awkward, introverted and thoughtful with a genuine passion for crafting great cars. While Rivian won't be offering robotaxi trips to mars anytime soon, I'd argue they don't need to do more than make great cars for a rapidly growing market.  When an industry needs to be created or revolutionized you need visionaries who can take 0 to 1. Electric cars are coming out of that phase and into one of iterative improvement. We will increasingly need leadership with high attention to small details, who will perfect what already exists.  Rivian isn't burdened with a sky-high valuation requiring earth-shattering innovations to maintain.  &amp;#x200B;  # Emeralds Can Crack  Being politically active on Twitter and divorced is a bad combination. What Elon craves most of all is attention and then validation. The constant dick-sucking from fringe crazies and mocking from normal people is going to drive him further out there. He doesn‚Äôt have close friends, is cut off from his family and can‚Äôt hold down a relationship. There isn‚Äôt a counterbalance in his life to stop him from getting nuttier.  This is going to bleed into the Tesla brand, particularly if he fully loses it.  &amp;#x200B;  # EV Is Supply Constrained  Last year 750k/16m vehicles sold in the US were electric. Over the next decade EVs will reach almost 100% market share for new vehicles. The last few covid/slowdown years have been awful for car sales but EV has kept powering on despite this.  Meeting this demand is the hardest part. Heavily indebted, low multiple, traditional car companies have invested hundreds of billions into factories that are becoming obsolete. EVs are a radically different business from combustion. The Ford f150 lighting is a great car, but they shipped just 3,600 in the first couple of months of 2023. This is what creates the opening for new players that have a head start.  &amp;#x200B;  # The Bad  Rivian is burning cash rapidly, it burnt $7b in the last year and is forecast to burn $4b this year. At this rate, it will need to raise more cash within 24 months. At the current low valuation, this would be very dilutive. They have a path to profitability but to afford rapid growth they‚Äôd need the share price to significantly recover.  The founder/CEO Scaringe looks to have sold most of his shares in the company which isn‚Äôt a sign of confidence.  Rivian doesn‚Äôt benefit from most of the massive Tesla charging network, building their own is expensive. Rivian isn‚Äôt as far along with self-driving AI.  Amazon has an exclusivity contract for the delivery vans, but they've ordered far less than originally promised. Rivian is looking to end the exclusivity agreement.  &amp;#x200B;  # TLDR  **Rivian has gotten killed along with the tech stocks it trades with. However, unlike tech stocks, Rivian has invested billions in hard assets, not intangible software. You can buy it so cheap that unless the business generates 0 ROI on its assets/cash, you're guaranteed to make a return.**  **Rivian makes great cars, that look incredible, in the hottest sector of the car market (SUV/pickups), in the exponentially growing EV space. They're benefitting from so many tailwinds, yet the stock is priced below net assets. Even with the challenge of raising fresh funds, their burn rate is decreasing, much of the heavy investment is already done and they have years of runway.**  **It's very difficult to see how this could go much lower, and it is very easy to see how it could go much higher. I foresee it being many multiples of its current value within a year or two.**  \---  If you want to see if I'm a regard you can check my previous posts and decide for yourself:  * September 28 2021: [The Great Market Wheeze is almost upon us](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pwvway/the_great_market_wheeze_is_almost_upon_us/) * February 22 2022: [I told you so‚Ä¶ The Great Wheeze is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/sygjdx/my_prediction_was_correct_the_great_wheeze_is_here/) * May 19 2022 [BUY BUY BUY GROWTH!

I had been burned on CPI before (see other posts about losing 210k in about 4 seconds last year) so bought some puts as a hedge on other positions and DCAd a bit too aggressively and ended up with 7800 contracts at a price of \~.17.  Lots were 10s of thousands on bid/ask but when I tried to close, it shrank to 1 to 50 and the candle would jump on each limit order (had to market sell) as this is approx $300,000,000 in notional value.  (Schwab also sucks balls on option order execution).  Instead of 600k+ in gains, I ended up closing for 15k in gains with a hurt mojo at the money I could have had and had fun losing later.  Last week I wanted to enter an iron condor but by the time my money swept from my futures account, it was too late.  On this Monday around open, I entered into a slightly bullish Iron Condor of 9000 contracts with expiry 5/1 and then jumped on a 4 hour plane trip which was delayed 2 hours without wifi, fingers crossed.  Strikes were:Long 2250 SPY 409pShort 2250 SPY 413pShort 2250 SPY -414cLong  2250 SPY 418c  Break even was 410.xx on low end and 416.xx on upper end.  Max gain was \~700k if spy closed between 413 and 414 on 5/1.  Max loss was \~300k.  [Iron Condor entry](https://preview.redd.it/eprp1x3qphwa1.png?width=2612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bd2c179527dd58bb9ad17441c142abfe0f2060c8)  Monday went OK.  Tuesday and Wednesday killed me...  Max loss.  I decided to leg out of the calls leaving \~60k on the table on the gains side in case it bounced back.  Was now down over 300k yesterday and Schwab flashed a "total lose of 750k" on screen.  I assumed this is normal as their % stuff is shit and nearly always wrong, and I usually just watch account balance. In the middle of the night it showed account balance going from 1.1m to 400k.  I got a tad worried as no calls, no emails no notifications.  Found out at 5am EST that 884 of by 413p I shorted were assigned early, and I was now long 88,400 shares of SPY which I sold at 413 overnight as there was no time value left on the 413p.   The extra loss was due to a reporting error in their shit UI.

Schwab encouraged me to exercise the 409s but I said I would watch GDP first as there may be time value left with the market rising.  Market kept going up, sure enough there was.  Reminder, check time value when exercising.  At open I had to have a broker on the phone for 90min while I slow walked sell orders of shares/puts to not be lopsided in the trade and tried to get benefit of the rising market.  I obviously wanted to keep them as long as possible as my max downside was already hit and I could only go up (assuming they didn't market sell the shares and leave my long puts or exercise for me, killing about 250k in time value).  I hand typed sell orders in lots of 1000-4000 for shares/puts for 90 min with a broker on the phone who was also talking to risk management.  Dude was seriously the most helpful person ever.  The exercise cost me about 300k-600k (who knows exactly with their shitty UI) in additional gains today on top of the 900k since I could not hold them due to not having $17m under my mattress that I could send on a moment notice.  The remaining of gains today was some revenge trading of about 8000 SPY call options at couple strikes which I bought Wednesday night.

[I didn't realize the hype around Palantir - Is this another Krispy Kreme - AI Imposter Syndrome is Real,;,; So I was actually doing some DD on Palantir because I am considering a position in it. I own 0 shares of PLTR. Before I make a statement on what position I am leaning towards I wanted to give a fair analysis from what i've found while looking up research on the company.  First, I was completely unaware of just how much hype is surrounding this stock. Then I came across a lot of talk around the Bear Cave report from Dorsey.  There is definately 2 sides to this argument. Dorsey is saying, effectively, there is no there there. The hype is saying there is something there.  In that simple take I have to overall side with Dorsey. It seems more of a question mark rather than a legitimate justification of a 30x trading stock. This reminds me of Krispy Cream more than it reminds me of that other stock (you know which one). Meaning, I am not saying the company isn't valid or doing great things I am just saying fundamentally:  1. Does it warrant such a high valuation? 2. Where is the hype coming from?  Dorsey's argument is simple, the ends won't be justified by the means. It's a salient argument. In this salient argument the straight comment bashing ensued about his credibility and nothing to speak on the merits of what he was actually saying.  To be fair there was a response that was, well, a response.  [Problems at the Bear Cave](https://www.palantirbullets.com/p/palantir-is-an-ai-imposter) by **ARNY TREZZI**  Here is what I think Arny got right about the response. The SPAC stuff I don't think that really matters in the end. It may be significant but it to me it seems like they are fighting hard for business at PLTR and I can't really knock them for that.  But Dorsey makes a salient point to this in general. Why are they fighting SO hard for business?  This leads back to the notion of being an AI imposter.  Arny talks about Palantir being an AI/ML platform leader in 2022.  Now, this is where my DD comes in because I speak strongly to this. You can think of this like baby jesus in the manger. There is BC and AD.  In purely AI terms that is known as BGPT3.5 and AGPT3.5. Period.  2022 is BGPT3.5  In my DD I argue that this period of AI was to me an AI winter or at least a damned Frost. It was cold as hell outside put it that way. Not from the amazing research perspective but from the end tangible/profitable generating perspective.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1966yp5/ai\_researchers\_write\_a\_paper\_ultimately\_proving/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1966yp5/ai_researchers_write_a_paper_ultimately_proving/)  Again, the hype around this stock, to me, seems that this is a little bit imposterish.  I think their(PLTR's) niche may be the military and some grocery stores and that may make perfect sense. But does that make it a $30B company?  If you're a major IT department and you are looking for any outside help you are going to Microsoft, OAI, Anthropic, AWS, IBM, and Google. If you want to commision a team of AI DS's you may go to Accenture or Capgemini.  That be the facts.  You are not going to convince me in a million years that a business is going to pass up all of those powerhouse companies that have AI products bleeding out of their pores right now to go with Palantir.  AI/ML BGPT3.5 was always sketchy at best.  Here's the business model.  I will come into your business and analyze your data. I will then give you recommendations on how my model can make your business processes more efficient. Give me a 3 year contract to yield results. We promise a profit and efficiency gain of 7%.  As told to me by my mentor 10 years ago. Do you know what happens during that 3 years period.  1. Business processes improve generally from the initial data analysis on their own product improvement cycles and sales training readjustments. This happens naturally without ML (let's not call this "AI"). 2. The profit efficiency gain, promised at 7%, turns into 1 - 3% and everyone is just pissed at some point in the processes.  This is why anecdotally you had people saying, out loud, stop calling everything AI and stop putting AI in your product pitches. This was happening prior to 2023. Everyone knows this.  Dorsey was arguing this point. The leads on PLTR contracts have been "problematic". Just think of the stock prior to GPT3.5 and this should all just seem super normal.  Where is all the hype coming from? Why?  **The AI imposter syndrome is real and Palantir isn't the only one doing it.**  I'll be frank major players are doing it too. Amazon is acting like Rufus is GPT4. It is not. The gushing on the last 5 minutes of that call was kind of ridiculous to me but analysts were slurping it up. To be frank you probably don't even need an LLM to build that. Pure NLP + software, a technology that has been out for years now, would have probably been just fine.  But is Palantir or anyone else for that matter wrong for riding the AI wave? Hmmm. If you're deceiving investors YES. This is the difference between Amazon and PLTR. Amazon has all of the tools and more to work on AI via AWS. There is no imposter stuff going on there. The call a bit ridiculous, the product line of AWS, chef's kiss.  PLTR, I have no clue what their "platform" exactly does that makes it SO unique from what's already out there in spades; but what I can unequivocally say, is that it doesn't hold jack shit compared to the big 3/4/5 (depending on how you see it)  I think this hype, in the end, is going to hurt people. If you can't explain clearly your business and you're touting the coattails of OpenAI's achievement as somehow your own. That to me is the very definition of AI Imposter Syndrome.  To me, this is clear as day. The question is, how much is the hype going to continue on an earnings beat of 17/18% growth for a 30x stock? It's just seems to taste a little bit like Krispy Kreme to me.  What is your expectation for the call this Monday?,;,; 2024-02-03 07:53:58]

["Why did the Dot Com bubble burst?",;,; " It‚Äôs always difficult to identify a single catalyst that causes the bursting of an asset bubble, but in the case of the internet bubble, two factors seem to have played at least some part in the industry‚Äôs rapid decline, which began after the tech-heavy [Nasdaq composite](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/n/nasdaq-composite) peaked on March 10th, 2000.  The first factor was rising interest rates. The [Federal Reserve](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/f/federal-reserve) raised the [fed funds rate](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/f/fed-funds-rate) (which informs most other interest rates) several times over the course of the years 1999 and 2000. Higher interest rates tend to motivate investors to move money out of more speculative assets (like internet company stocks) and into interest-paying assets like bonds.  The second factor was the onset of a [recession](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/r/recession) in Japan in March of 2000. News of this recession spread fast and led to a wave of fear that triggered a worldwide selloff, moving even more money out of speculative equities and into safer, fixed-income instruments like bonds."  **HMMM, it really seems like this is exactly what's happening now. The FED is going to increase interest rates, which will kill startups. The venture capital will dry up when investors realize that bonds are safer than the stock market. Earnings only look good right now because of inflation, and sky high PE ratios will soar on bad earnings. Hedges will switch strategy to shorting the market once they realize there is more money to be made off of puts than on calls. China is already hitting major economic turmoil which will have global effects. Consumers will not have any money to spend on goods because they all have 20% car loans and 9% mortgages, and their 500 dollar student loan payments just resumed.

Yes NVDA is expensive but *relative* to the market and considering its extraordinary growth its actually not too bad. Add to this the fact that demand is only going to increase as businesses are spending looking to incorporate generative ai .

In addition there are jobs like customer service which are likely to be automated or at least slashed because of this and this too require more gpus.

[How is UPS not crashing right now?,;,; Let me get these numbers right,   UPS is investing $30b into employee salary and benefits over 5 years.   UPS has $9b cash on hand.   Scratching my head on this one. How is UPS affording these raises? They are going to have to take on extra debt or sell shares. They make $10b/year profit. They are going to have to spend $6b/year just for the employees. **They just cut their profit by 60%**. Am I missing something? And these costs will go up after 5 years, you'll have a much higher percentage of employees sitting at 5+ years and higher percentage of full time employees (that's what happens when you offer $170k for a job that requires no education).   Seems to me like UPS deserves a 50% correction. Am I wrong?  EDIT: to all you dumb regards saying "HAHA YOU BOUGHT PUTS AMIRITE????" stfu. I literally don't have **any** positions in the market, and I am broke AF and won't be investing any time in the near future. You know when can have a negative outlook on a company without buying risky investments at the same time right?  &gt; Seems to me like UPS deserves a 50% correction. Am I wrong?  This is an open ended question and the post is tagged as 'discussion'. Some of you need to grow the fuck up and learn to read.  And stop treating this like some DD. It's not. I saw a few numbers, had a few thoughts, and threw them down, and asked a question. This post reflects my initial thoughts on the matter. That's it. $30b over 5 years seemed like a fuck ton, but as pointed out to me, UPS already spends $44b/year on employees, so if that's the case then $30b over 5 years isn't that much. Done. My question answered. I asked, "Am I wrong?" answer is yes because I was missing some context. HOLY SHIT I WAS WRONG? idgaf. This was a question I posted out of curiosity. I'm not even in the fucking market.  EDIT 2: as some have pointed out, $170k is including benefits, and at 60 hours/week. Totally different than what I assumed, which is what my entire question was based on.  **LAST EDIT** No need to comment on this anymore you regards. $170k figure was wrong. It's $120k + benefits, and that's at 60 hours a week. Totally different story. I think that's reasonable and maybe only 5-10% higher than I would have thought. UPS will be fine.

[Cloudfare (NET) and Affirm (AFRM),;,; Hello everyone, I was not anticipating such a huge jump from these two companies today and was planning on providing information on both today. I will provide a consolidated breakdown for both below. Sorry for the delay and potential missed opportunities.   AFRM Description:  AFFIRM Holdings, Inc is a financial technology company that offers point of sale loans to customers at various locations. The company allows for online and in person purchases that you can pay later through an installment plan that is implemented through the company‚Äôs artificial intelligence program. The interest rate of the installment plan is calculated using this platform and offers no hidden fees or late charges. This by now pay later idea has taken off in recent quarters and can be seen through the increasing earnings showcased by a firm. The company has vastly expanded their merchant offering to companies like Walmart and Amazon which has boosted their sales tremendously. The company has also recently been revising their earnings projections upward which is always a good sign. ¬† NET Description:  Cloudfare is an Internet infrastructure and cybersecurity company aimed at improving the security and performance of websites and internet companies. They provide services ranging from Domain Name System services to edge computing along with other various security services. Looking at past performance, Cloudfare has only missed projections once in March 2023 where they missed revenue by .22%. Based on the analysis it seems as though this company prefers to be very realistic in their projections and oftentimes undershoot what they expect their earnings to be. Over the past 12 months the company has experienced growth of 54.5% in their stock price but is still below their all-time highs by 56%.  Consolidated Verdict:  Prior to providing my opinion, I must preface with a disclosure that options trading is extremely risky and losing all your money is a very real possibility and that this is not financial advice. Whether you elect to agree with my personal decision is entirely up to you, and this post is simply intended to provide more information into the company. Looking at a consolidated verdict for both of these companies, I expect both to beat revenue and EPS projections and provide positive guidance.   Affirm: My largest fear with Affirm is their future outlook on consumer spending and credit card delinquency. I believe this past quarter they performed very well due to the holiday season and expanding partnerships with Walmart and Amazon but the stock price may be pushed downward due to negative outlook on where the market is heading. However, I still believe this stock has room to run and I therefore own 1 $48.00 call option expiring February 9th.   Cloudfare: Cybersecurity is a great industry to be invested in and has outperformed outlook tremendously over the past few years. Looking at Cloudfare and their cautious projections, I anticipate that they will beat both EPS and revenue numbers. With an industry like this positive forward guidance should be of no issue and I therefore believe this stock will heading higher post earnings. As of now I own 1 $87.00 call expiring February 9th. Again anything can happen with these companies but I believe in cybersecurity and the work that the company is performing.,;,; 2024-02-08 20:51:15]

There's a BP engineer who's a daily user and devotee of Palantir's Foundry platform posted an interesting screenshot. He's genuinely blown away by what the software can do. In his eyes, it's reshaping the business landscape, much like iOS did for smartphones.    Even in this rocky economy, Foundry is showing its mettle. It's pushing Palantir's U.S. commercial business to impressive heights, hitting a cool $1 billion annual run rate in just six years. That's some Amazon Web Services (AWS) level growth right there.  The engineer is betting on Foundry to shake things up, and take data and process handling to the next level. More efficiency, more innovation - that's the direction he sees this going.  In his business unit alone, BP is already running 36 applications on Foundry, and that's just the beginning. With new software like AIP on the horizon, he's expecting some solid gains for both BP and Palantir.

[Nvidia chases $30 billion custom chip market with new unit,;,; Nvidia NVDA  is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for  cloud computing firms and others, including advanced artificial  intelligence processors, according to nine sources familiar with the  company's plans.  The dominant global designer and  supplier of AI chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market  for custom AI chips and to protect itself from the growing number of  companies interested in finding alternatives to its products.  The  Santa Clara, California-based company currently controls about 80% of  the market for high-end AI chips, a position that has sent its market  value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than  tripled in 2023.  Its customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOG and Meta Platforms META, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of Nvidia chips to compete in the rapidly emerging generative AI sector.  Nvidia's  H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor  for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started  to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps  reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time  to design.  Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in  helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to  rival firms such as Broadcom AVGO and Marvell Technology MRVL, according to the sources who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  "If  you're really trying to optimize on things like power, or optimize on  cost for your application, you can't afford to go drop an H100 or A100  in there," Greg Reichow, general partner at venture capital firm Eclipse  Ventures said in an interview. "You want to have the exact right  mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need."  Nvidia does not disclose H100 prices, which are higher than for the  prior-generation A100, but each chip can sell from $16,000 to $100,000  depending on the volume purchased and other factors. Meta has said it  plans to bring its total stock to 350,000 H100s this year.  Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon .com AMZN,  Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for  them, according to two sources familiar with the meetings. Beyond data  center chips, the company has pursued telecom, automotive and video game  customers.  In 2022, Nvidia said it would let  third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking  technology with their own chips. The company has said nothing about the  program since, and Reuters is reporting its wider ambitions for the  first time.  A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company's 2022 announcement.  Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices AMD  and Marvell executive, heads Nvidia's custom unit and her team's goal  is to make its technology available for customers in cloud, 5G wireless,  video games and automotives, according to a LinkedIn profile. Those  mentions were scrubbed and her title was changed after Reuters sought  comment from Nvidia.  Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment.  $30 BILLION MARKET  According  to estimates from research firm 650 Group‚Äôs Alan Weckel, the data  center custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year,  and double that in 2025.  The broader custom chip market  was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023, which amounts to roughly 5% of  annual global chip sales, according to Needham analyst Charles Shi.  Currently, custom silicon design for data centers is dominated by Broadcom and Marvell.  In  a typical arrangement, a design partner such as Nvidia would offer  intellectual property and technology, but leave the chip fabrication,  packaging and additional steps to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  2330 or another contract chip manufacturer.  Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales.  "With  Broadcom's custom silicon business touching $10 billion, and Marvell‚Äôs  around $2 billion, this is a real threat," said Dylan Patel, founder of  the silicon research group SemiAnalysis. "It's a real big negative -  there's more competition entering the fray."  BEYOND AI  Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson 61QS  for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics  processing unit (GPU) technology, according to two sources familiar with  the talks.  650 Group's Weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year.  Ericsson declined to comment.  Nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video game markets, according to sources and public social media postings.  Weckel  expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6  billion to $8 billion range at 20% a year, and the $7 billion to $8  billion video game custom chip market could increase with the  next-generation consoles from Xbox and Sony 6857.  Nintendo‚Äôs  current Switch handheld console already includes an Nvidia chip, the  Tegra X1. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is  likely to include a Nvidia custom design, according to one source.  Nintendo declined to comment.  &amp;#x200B;  \- Reuters,;,; 2024-02-09 13:25:56]
[Lay-offs don‚Äôt mean recession,;,; Global giants like McDonalds laying off people doesn‚Äôt correlate to decreased demand for their products. It correlates to increased costs.

So if your company is a global company that has a lot of exposure to minimum wages, expect lay-offs.   As for Tech.

[Everything you need to know about ROKU earnings here,;,; Just yesterday, I made a post about [getting AMD calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17kq09i/amd_earnings_time_to_hit_it_big/) and the stock is now up 8%. Who followed me? Last week, we platyed [Amazon](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17h0sy7/amazon_earnings_the_boomer_play_that_could_print/) and it printed big time. Well now, it's finally time. ROKU is set to unveil its Q3 numbers today, and the Street is betting on a loss of $2.041 per share, a significant jump from last year's $0.880 loss per share in the same quarter. Revenue estimates are sitting at a cool $857 million, up 12.56% YoY. Not shabby at all.  In the to-be-reported quarter, Roku inked a killer TV streaming advertising deal with TV Azteca in Mexico. This is expected to boost advertising revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.  Active account growth is still solid, net adds were 1.9 million in the second quarter. This makes it a total of 73.5 million active accounts globally, driven primarily by the Roku TV licensing program in the U.S. and international markets. This is a 16% increase over the past year. Engagement is holding up even better as users streamed 25.1 billion hours, surging 21% over the past year. Fears that folks would stream less TV at home after the height of pandemic lockdowns have proven unwarranted. Take that, pandemic blues. But it's not all sunshine and rainbows. ‚¨áÔ∏è  The company has been facing challenges from the macroeconomic environment, such as inflation and recessionary fear. The supply chain issues are causing disruptions in its player unit sales in terms of shipping delays, product availability issues and product price increases.  Both consumers and advertisers are dropping their spending, which will negatively impact the company‚Äôs earnings for the quarter. In the second quarter, the average revenue per user (ARPU) dropped 7% from the prior-year quarter‚Äôs levels to $40.67 (on a trailing 12-month basis). Our model estimate for ARPU is pegged at $40.8, indicating a decline of 7.8% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.  Despite shares trading 38% higher in 2023, remember Roku peaked at around $500 in 2021. The stock's been on a rollercoaster, and the ride's not over. Ad-supported revenue is slackin', user gains aren't translating to profits, and analysts are bracing for a seventh straight quarterly loss.  Still bullish on Roku? Know this: Wall Street doesn't see profits until 2027. Also, the SAG-AFTRA strike ain't helping, and that content void will eventually bite Roku and its advertisers in the ass.  So, what's it gonna be, apes? As this post is being written, ROKU options are pricing a 13.5% move in the stock after the earnings announcement. I kinda don't wanna play it. The implied volatility rank of 65% prior to earnings is the highest that we've seen since November 2022. There is certainly more downside skew than upside which is arguably warranted since the stock has been cut in half since August. üìâ What I do know is that ROKU on average moves well over 10% with earnings. So I'm gonna grab a 11/03 55p lotto at 1.81. Keep in mind, this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. Tomorrow we have AAPL, SQ, DKNG, COIN, and CVNA so keep your eyes peeled!,;,; 2023-11-01 19:35:57]
[AMC status??,;,; Box Office reports for Jan, Feb, and March are all up this year over the last. I know there will be dilution from the reverse split and AMC is in a lot of debt, but is it really still considered overvalued??? There's still so much hype with AMC too, with its 15% gain from just the rumor of being bought out by Amazon, and the over 20% gain just before the February earnings. It also has stayed above the 4 dollar range every low (Key word: range, it was 3.84 to be exact but still that same area), which I would consider its near term support level. Maybe I'm regarded but I think the 200+ IV on some of the puts in the next few weeks is regarded. Any opinion would help.,;,; 2023-04-03 01:49:29]

[Nvidia blowout earnings ripple across tech, highlighting winners and questions.,;,; Nvidia earnings have been a significant milestone for the tech industry, with a 101% increase in revenue to $13.51 billion. The company has become a bellwether for the AI boom, with an ecosystem where a win for Nvidia can come in tandem with wins for some additional companies. The Magnificent Seven, including big tech companies like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft, as well as banks and financial institutions that invested directly, are expected to benefit from Nvidia's rise.  Amazon and Microsoft are particularly key due to their existing cloud partnerships with Nvidia, while Meta has an existing consumer-focused partnership with the chipmaker. Snowflake and VMware also emerged as winners, both of which have relatively new enterprise partnerships. Alphabet's shares rose as much as 3% after Nvidia's report, and Nvidia and Google Cloud announced a partnership emphasizing AI hardware in March.  Despite the AI hype, Nvidia's earnings show some key resilience. Competitors such as Qualcomm, Intel, and AMD saw their shares in the red on Thursday, with AMD experiencing the steepest decline. However, there is still room for all in the current market, as competition is fierce and they have different strengths and weaknesses.  Critical infrastructure for the AI boom is also shifting, with companies having to revamp their existing systems over time to meet the demand for AI. Data centers, at the center of operations for most tech companies, are in flux as the demand for Nvidia chips is re-forming how data centers will operate and grow. As AI pushes data center buildings to be larger and denser than ever before, companies must adapt to meet the growing demand for AI. ,;,; 2023-08-25 10:32:17]

[Major 401k funds rebalancing incoming. Small and mid cap growth stock rallying.,;,; Ok indulge me eventually small cap growth stock going to be too cheap, and large cap tech will become too expensive. Most fund will have to do a rebalance. Which is why when a large cap over extend itself you see a small pull back. Some come from individual investors cashing in but the major movers are from large 401k fund rebalancing. Because say they want 80 percent large cap and 20 small for example. When the large cap gets too big LIKE AMAZON then the portfolio will be like 86 % large cap and only 14% so having said that large fund will automatically sell some large cap and buy some small cap to rebalance. SMALL CAPS and MID caps growth stocks are just too cheap to ignore.   Especially  When Fed actually cut rate the cost of doing business is lower due to lower rate. Companies can afford to borrow more at a lower cost which allow them to expand and invest more into R&amp;D. Also perhaps opportunities into large pharmaceuticals since they have been pulling back.,;,; 2023-12-14 21:37:25]

[If you think SAG will get what they're asking for, Short NFLX,;,; I am in the industry fwiw.  Hypothetically,  Netflix (NFLX) could be left in a rather precarious position, should  the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) emerge victorious from their prolonged  clash and attain their sought-after objectives. The core issue that  beckons our contemplation is the foreseen escalation in production  costs, a consequence of SAG's potentially successful campaign for  enhanced compensation and improved working conditions for thespian  talents.    The heart of Netflix's allure resides in its prolific creation  of original content. It's an arena where they have staked a substantial  claim, consistently wowing audiences with a diverse array of offerings.  However, if SAG's demands are met, this narrative could alter  significantly.    Picture a scenario where the payout to writers significantly  inflates, and the benchmarks for working conditions become loftier. The  immediate consequence is an augmentation in production expenses that  could spiral out of control.     Now, let's dissect the repercussions of these burgeoning costs:       **Margin Squeeze**: A ballooning budget for content production  is likely to exert immense pressure on Netflix's profit margins. As they  strive to satiate the demands of both shareholders and content-hungry  subscribers, there might be a disconcerting erosion of profitability.       **Competitive Stagnation:** In the intensely competitive arena  of streaming, where Netflix faces a relentless barrage from Amazon Prime  Video, Disney+, HBO Max, and a host of other contenders, a sudden surge  in production costs could leave Netflix lagging in the race. To secure  and retain subscribers, they'd be constrained in their ability to offer  competitive pricing or to fund further innovative content.  This hits affects NFLX disproportionately because streaming is their Only Business; furthermore, they rely on newly-produced original content to a greater degree than other services.     **Quality Conundrum:** Netflix's brand has been inexorably tied  to the quality of its original productions. If SAG's victory  necessitates budgetary restraint, the perilous question emerges: can  they sustain the caliber of content that has endeared them to  subscribers worldwide? A decline in quality could precipitate viewer  dissatisfaction and attrition.    Let us foster discourse and exchange perspectives, for it is in  the crucible of collective intellect that we may glean the most  sagacious insights. However, heed this counsel: consult a financial sage  or undertake exhaustive research before embarking on any investment odyssey. Discuss.,;,; 2023-09-04 13:25:10]
[AMZN Earnings Report Q2 2023,;,; \*\* I'm for whatever reason, enjoying going through the documents and attempting to make it easier to digest and read. I just started doing this so any feedback would be appreciated. Goal is for a quick overview of the earnings report for an average person to be able to read and digest\*\*  1. Operating Activities:    The operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows showcases how Amazon generates cash from its core business operations. In both periods, the company's operating activities generated positive cash flow. There was a significant increase in net income, showing growth from a loss of $2.03 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. This highlights a remarkable improvement in Amazon's financial performance and operational efficiency.        2. Investing Activities:    Amazon invested heavily in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions during the analyzed periods. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, the company's investments in property and equipment amounted to $15.72 billion, which decreased to $11.45 billion in the same period in 2023. While the absolute values decreased, these investments are essential for the company's long-term growth and expansion.        3. Financing Activities:    The financing activities section details Amazon's capital structure and shareholder returns. The company engaged in various financing activities, including repurchasing common stock, resulting in cash outflows of $3.33 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2023, and $6 billion in the six months ending June 30, 2022. Additionally, the company obtained proceeds from short-term debt and other financing, contributing $4.87 billion and $4.4 billion in the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. Investors should be aware of these activities, as they impact the company's capital allocation strategy.        4. Cash Position:    Amazon maintained a strong cash position, reflecting its financial stability and liquidity. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased steadily over the periods, reaching $50.07 billion at the end of the twelve months ending June 30, 2023. This signifies the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations and pursue growth opportunities.        5. Debt and Interest Payments:    The company managed its debt obligations efficiently, making principal repayments on long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations. Amazon also paid interest on debt, with cash outflows totaling $349 million and $954 million for the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. These payments demonstrate responsible debt management and the company's commitment to meeting its financial obligations.        6. Net Sales:    Net sales are a fundamental indicator of Amazon's revenue growth and market performance. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, net sales reached $121.23 billion, which increased to $134.38 billion in the same period in 2023, representing an 11% year-over-year growth. Similarly, for the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net sales grew from $237.68 billion to $261.74 billion, showing strong and consistent revenue growth.        7. Operating Expenses:    Operating expenses provide insights into the company's cost structure and efficiency. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, operating expenses were $117.92 billion, which increased to $126.70 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating expenses increased from $230.69 billion to $249.29 billion, primarily due to higher fulfillment, technology, and infrastructure costs. Despite the increase, Amazon's revenue growth outpaced the rise in operating expenses, leading to improved operating income.        8. Operating Income:    Operating income measures the profitability of Amazon's core operations. The company experienced significant growth in operating income, increasing from $3.32 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to $7.68 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating income rose from $6.99 billion to $12.46 billion, indicating improved operational efficiency and profitability.        9. Non-Operating Expense:    The non-operating expense provides insights into Amazon's other income and expenses outside its core operations. Total non-operating expense decreased from ($5.97) billion to ($0.12) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. This decline was primarily due to a positive swing in other income (expense), net, indicating favorable financial management.        10. Net Income (Loss):    Net income is a critical metric that assesses Amazon's overall financial performance. The company experienced a significant improvement in net income, increasing from a loss of ($2.03) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net income increased from a loss of ($5.87) billion to a profit of $9.92 billion, demonstrating a strong financial turnaround.        11. Earnings Per Share (EPS):    Earnings per share is a vital metric for shareholders, as it represents the company's profitability on a per-share basis. Basic earnings per share increased from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.66 for the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. Diluted earnings per share showed similar growth, rising from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.65 for the same periods.        12. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):    Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items that impact the company's financial position but are not part of the net income calculation. For the three months ending June 30, 2022, Amazon's other comprehensive income was ($2.42) billion, which increased to $293 million for the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, other comprehensive income was ($3.41) billion and $807 million, respectively.        13. Comprehensive Income (Loss):    Comprehensive income is the total change in equity during a period, including net income and other comprehensive income. For the three months ending June 30, 2022, Amazon reported a comprehensive loss of ($4.45) billion, which improved to a comprehensive income of $7.04 billion for the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, comprehensive loss improved from ($9.28) billion to a comprehensive income of $8.33 billion, highlighting the company's financial recovery.        14. Segment Information:    Amazon operates through several segments, including North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, all segments showed significant growth in net sales.        ‚Ä¢	North America: Net sales in North America increased from $80.85 billion to $87.75 billion, representing a 9% year-over-year growth.    ‚Ä¢	International: Net sales in the International segment grew from $31.9 billion to $37.4 billion, reflecting a 17% year-over-year growth.    ‚Ä¢	AWS: Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud computing segment, experienced remarkable growth, with net sales increasing from $16.37 billion to $20.2 billion, showing a 23% year-over-year growth.        Conclusion:    Amazon demonstrated robust financial performance and growth in the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. The company's operating activities generated positive cash flow, and net sales increased consistently across all segments. Investments in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions reflect Amazon's focus on long-term growth and expansion.        Although the financing activities included cash outflows related to stock repurchases, the company's strong cash position and responsible debt management position Amazon well for future growth. The substantial improvement in net income and operating income signifies improved financial performance and operational efficiency.                PROs &amp; CONs:    Pros:        ‚Ä¢	Strong Revenue Growth: Amazon has consistently demonstrated strong revenue growth across its various segments. The company's ability to expand its customer base, introduce new products and services, and leverage its e-commerce platform has led to impressive financial performance.    ‚Ä¢	Diversification of Business Segments: Amazon has successfully diversified its business beyond e-commerce. The expansion into cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been a major growth driver, providing the company with a stable and profitable source of revenue.    ‚Ä¢	Innovative and Customer-Centric Approach: Amazon's relentless focus on customer satisfaction, innovative technologies like Amazon Prime, and personalized shopping experiences have helped the company build a loyal customer base and maintain a competitive edge in the market.    ‚Ä¢	Financial Stability and Liquidity: The company maintains a strong cash position and prudent debt management, providing it with the financial flexibility to invest in new ventures and navigate economic uncertainties.    ‚Ä¢	Global Reach: Amazon operates in numerous countries, allowing it to tap into diverse markets and consumer preferences worldwide. Its vast international presence positions the company for further growth and market dominance.    ‚Ä¢	Leading Cloud Service Provider: AWS is a dominant force in the cloud computing industry, serving a wide range of clients, from startups to large enterprises. The profitability and growth of AWS contribute significantly to Amazon's overall financial success.        Cons:        ‚Ä¢	Regulatory Scrutiny: Amazon faces increasing regulatory scrutiny related to its market dominance and business practices. Antitrust concerns and accusations of unfair competition may lead to potential legal challenges and fines.    ‚Ä¢	Labor Practices: The company has faced criticism for its labor practices, including allegations of poor working conditions and treatment of employees at its fulfillment centers. Such negative publicity can impact Amazon's reputation and may affect its ability to attract and retain talent.    ‚Ä¢	Highly Competitive Markets: The e-commerce and cloud computing industries are highly competitive, with major players vying for market share. Amazon faces challenges from established competitors and emerging startups, requiring continuous investment in innovation and technology.    ‚Ä¢	Dependence on Global Supply Chain: Amazon's vast supply chain network is critical for delivering products to customers. Any disruptions, such as those caused by geopolitical events or natural disasters, could affect the company's operations and financial performance.    ‚Ä¢	Profit Margins: While Amazon experiences strong revenue growth, its profit margins have historically been relatively low. Intense competition and ongoing investments in new ventures can put pressure on the company's profitability.    ‚Ä¢	Environmental Impact: As a large-scale retailer and cloud services provider, Amazon's operations have an environmental impact. The company has faced criticism for its carbon footprint, and there are growing expectations from stakeholders for more significant efforts towards sustainability.    TLDR;    Amazon recent earnings report for the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, reveals a robust financial performance and impressive revenue growth across its segments. The company generated positive cash flow from operating activities, showing a significant increase in net income, indicating improved financial health and operational efficiency. Amazon's strategic investments in property, equipment, and acquisitions demonstrate a focus on long-term growth and expansion. With a strong cash position and responsible debt management, the company exhibits financial stability and flexibility. However, regulatory scrutiny, labor practices, and intense competition pose potential challenges. Despite these, Amazon remains a leading player in the e-commerce and cloud computing industries, presenting attractive prospects for investors seeking exposure to a market-dominant, innovative, and customer-centric company with a history of success and growth.    ,;,; 2023-08-04 00:03:33]

They sold all but two of my existing stocks (AAPL, AMZN) and invested heavily (but not exclusively) in consumer discretionary stocks. Results: 2022 down 11%, 2023 down almost 9% YTD. Overall, down close to 20%.   The new portfolio is extremely volatile, usually 1-2% swings each day, but today it went down ~4% due to huge losses in just two stocks. Some individual stocks are down 55-70% YTD; few are in the black. Just about every stock is performing worse than its respective market index.   In the case of the biggest losers, the chief investment officer basically went to the sunk cost fallacy - we (I) have lost so much we should just hold to see what can be recovered.

[Covered Calls - Risks for a long term investor,;,; Hey all, new to options. I'm a longterm investor, and I don't really plan on ever going outside of my comfort zone of choosing positions that I believe in the long term (so nothing outside of covered calls really). I am still confused on just some aspects about covered calls regarding risk and theory.  I have two questions:  1.) When I own 100 shares of AMZN at price 95 (long position). Say my strike price is 102. However within the timeframe of the option, the stock price went DOWN to 89. The option is definitely worthless and will not be exercised. Here, I can collect that premium I got. However, there really is no risk here right? I never planned to sell my AMZN shares in the first place would it have gone down (and instead would have just dollar cost averaged over time). So I collect the premium for free right?  2.) Choosing a strike price that is way OTM. Meaning I have 100 shares of AMZN at 95. What is stopping me from choosing a strike price that is ridiculously high so that I can feel comfortable that it wont really necessarily reach that within the expiration date? Say a strike price of 120. I do understand that the premium that I get would be drastically lower, but what really is the risk to this or con? Something has to give right? I think what I am trying to understand is, someone has to choose to buy the option, and if there is no buyer, then I get no premium however little it is, and I'm only just out 65 cents of the option writing fee right? Or say the premium is absurdly low where it's below even the 65 cents fee were somehow someone actually bought it and i just pay the difference in the premium and the 65 cent fee? This is the theoretical bit I'd like to know. Obviously with covered calls, there is no point if you don't get a premium.   I really appreciate anyone helping me on this. I'm a long term investor so I don't mind the downside of a stock going down, but I would really like for me to minimize the chance for the call to be exercised (although I definitely know it happens). If it were to be exercised it's not the end of the world for me either.,;,; 2023-02-23 00:37:33]

[The biggest lesson that I've learned in my 10 year investing career.,;,; Why do companies like $WMT $COST $AMZN and $MSFT just keep on outperforming over time?  Culture.  They are perpetual innovation machines.  Sometimes, their culture goes astray but eventually it gets fixed.  When culture goes south, the company goes south.  When it gets fixed, the company goes back to doing well.  Culture is a result of a series of excellent organizational properties.  All companies that I own that have an excellent culture (which again, is a condensation of many aspects) just continue doing well.  Those that do not, eventually turn into losers.  Take $MSFT for instance.  The stock was flat from the year 2000 to the year 2014.  Why? Because Steve Ballmer operated a culture that sucked.  High in politics, low in innovation.  People were scared to fail, so no one shared ideas.  Good news moved fast around the company. Bad news, not so much.  Then came Satya and totally transformed the culture.  $MSFT shifted to being low in politics, high in meritocracy.  High in individual courage. Courage to innovate, share ideas and fail over and over until success comes.  Decentralized operations. Bad news now move around the company just as fast as good news.  All of a sudden, the company is now an unstoppable innovation machine.  Don't believe me? Read Satya's shareholder letters.  Read Jeff Bezos' work.  Read Sam Walton's work.  They all understand/understood this.  They all think the same and their organizations are fundamentally the same.  They are perpetual innovation machines and that is why the keep on outperforming, against all odds.,;,; 2023-12-23 11:55:36]

[Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,;,; From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/apple-to-spend-billions-more-on-entertainment-7370447)  "Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.  KEY TAKEAWAYS Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.  The company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.  Previously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.  The move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.  Apple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release.   The company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.  The company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.   The new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).   Apple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.   So far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.  Apple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year.   In each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.  Apple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed."  Personally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.,;,; 2023-03-28 09:43:30]
[Is it recommended to buy stocks during a bear market and indexes during a bull market?,;,; When I first started out investing (Mid 2021), everything was really overvalued (imo. Didn't do much research). I ended up buying only low fee Total Market Indexes for the first year because I didn't feel like buying anything else. But ever since stocks started to fall en masse, I've been getting more and more tempted to buy individual stocks (GOOGL, MSFT, AAPL, DIS, META, AMZN) and haven't focused on buying ETFS. My portfolio went from 100% in one ETF to about 80% in it and the rest in stocks.   I have never sold a stock and only keep accumulating. So I've recently been thinking that maybe stocks are not a great option for me. It would probably be better for me if I only buy the Total Market ETF and just exit out of stocks.

[Advice on what to do with cash inside a brokerage account?,;,; So background: I have an individual account with \~$37,000.00 in it. I \~usually\~ only keep about $1,000.00 cash in the account, waiting for my next stock/etf to invest in. Due to having a relatively good year, i've trimmed some of my individual stocks. Basically just taking profits of a few companies that have really appreciated this year (UBER, AMZN, GOOG).   So now, i'm sitting about $6,000 cash. The current holdings im in (SPY, SCHW, USB, ALTO, UBER, PINS, ISCG) all have had a really good run the last few months relative to my entry point (amongst many things in the market, of course). Meaning that they are at least AT the % of holding that i am comfortable with holding (AKA, don't want to add anymore to these holdings).   I really haven't had the time to dive into companies and even if i did, i probably will wait til earnings season is over until i put more into other individual stocks.

[My Willy-Nilly Stock Portfolio,;,; Hey, guess what! I'm beating the market YTD!  My make-believe portfolio is up 12.2% vs. 11.8% for VOO, a whopping 0.4% advantage.  The portfolio holds 38 company stocks. The thing is, I picked the stocks more or less at random ‚Äî just companies that I've heard of and "seemed" like they might do well going forward.

[How Nasdaq 100 ‚ÄòSpecial Rebalance‚Äô on July 24 will affect tech stocks,;,; On July 7 [Nasdaq announced](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/the-nasdaq-100-index-special-rebalance-to-be-effective-july-24-2023-2023-07-07) its third-ever 'special rebalance' of the Nasdaq 100 index, which will take effect July 24, 2023.  As a result of the rebalance, you should expect Nasdaq to [significantly decrease the weight of the largest stocks](https://www.tastylive.com/news-insights/everything-you-need-to-know-about-what-will-happen-to-the-nasdaq-after-the-special-rebalance) ($MSFT, $AAPL, $GOOGL/$GOOG, $NVDA, and $AMZN) from a total of 43+% to below a 38.5% maximum. TSLA may also see a small downward weighting. Smaller stocks should see a small increase in the weight.  ETFs/mutual funds that try to follow the Nasdaq 100 (such as $QQQ) will need to adjust their holdings accordingly. So you should expect them to sell the largest stocks and buy the smaller ones -- perhaps they already have -- and that will affect the prices of those stocks accordingly.  It also means that those ETFs/mutual funds will not accurately reflect the relative weight of the largest stocks. So if you wish to be weighted according to actual market cap, you would need to supplement those holdings.  Normally the index rebalances every quarter. But the largest stocks are dominating the index and funds that follow the index need to maintain compliance with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule on fund diversification. On July 3, the largest six stocks saw their combined weight reach 50.9% of the index.

[Is a potential breakthrough in AI research/application going to be reflected in S&amp;P 500?,;,; With AI being the new hot topic out there, we see so many companies investing a lot of resources in R&amp;D hoping for a big breakthrough. While it is normal to see emerging companies being innovative and investors looking for opportunities, it can also be seen that companies such as MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL, AMZN are heavily invested into the idea, particularly MSFT with its continuous investment into OpenAI.  I don't see AI being an investment fad, for a lack of a better term, like it can be argued that blockchain, cryptocurrencies or NFTs were at some point. With that, I am mostly referring to ordinary investors that would invest in such assets on a long-term basis rather than traders looking for large returns with any of the financial instruments at their disposal.  Given the fact that the companies mentioned above already represent a fair share of the S&amp;P 500 index, is it safe to assume that any potential global breakthrough in AI is going to affect the value of any relevant ETFs since we do not know which of those major companies is going to be the first/best to reap the benefits of AI? Or the more risky approach of picking stocks like MSFT and emerging companies is more likely to be more profitable?  Some may argue that a breakthrough in AI R&amp;D is imminent but that it might actually result in a dot-com bubble-like crash because the current market prices have already factored in the expectation of larger returns which may or may not actually happen with AI.  In a nutshell, can S&amp;P 500 ETF investing reap the benefits of a potential AI revolution or investors still have to take the risk and pick individual stocks? Can a crash of S&amp;P 500 value be expected because some sectors could potentially lose value with AI or the prices are already too ambitious with some expectations on AI?,;,; 2023-05-12 04:59:05]
[Adding top companies on top of index funds?,;,; I am receiving a good sum of money and I am looking to start positions in some index funds. I'm cost averaging down over the next 2 years but I am also considering adding additional position in the top 5 individual companies. Considering that the top 5 companies are responsible for a large portion of the S&amp;P's growth I feel having slightly more exposure to these guys would be better and I also think that the bigger market cap's are going to be the ones that benefit from AI the most. I'm obviously interested in AI and trying to learn as much as I can but there is a massive amount of hype involved right now and I don't think a lot of these smaller AI companies will survive so I'm waiting them out before I start adding tech and pure AI plays. I started getting interested in markets 2 years ago and actually switch my college degree focus to finance. I have an opportunity to start building my own portfolio which is great so I'm wondering what everyone thinks of adding additional shares in the top 5 on top of the index funds? It's a pretty simple approach and I feel if the top 5 companies typically drive the S&amp;P then I might as well get 100 percent exposure to them. I would look at doing 90 percent into index funds and 10 percent into the top 5 companies and will be holding for the next 10 to 20 years.   ,;,; 2023-08-08 18:49:35]
[Should I stay in blue chip/ETF combination for long-term investing?,;,; In 2021, I received an inheritance. At the time, I invested around 20% of that inheritance into each of the following: Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, and VTI.

I could, and put that money into index/ETF, but they are all now turning some profit and mostly seem like safe companies at the moment.

I‚Äôm wanting to exit those losing positions hopefully soon and sort out how else to allocate those funds. I will probably have the Roth IRA managed by my retirement company once I exit those positions so I don‚Äôt have to worry about it. I‚Äôll also be getting quite the tax harvest from the selling the positions in my brokerage account.   With all the losing positions I sell in my brokerage, I‚Äôll have ~40k of cash to do whatever with. The other ~$63k is invested in TSLA, Google, Microsoft, Apple, AMD &amp; AMZN. I have a $30k position in TSLA, so that‚Äôs most of it.   I‚Äôm thinking about taking the $40k I get from my losses and putting it in a HYSA, but not sure that would be the best thing to do. I think it would certainly be much less stressful than investing over $100k myself, but I also don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll need the money very soon.   I‚Äôm single and currently live in Denver (I hate it here), and would love to be able to go to a warmer place, potentially San Diego if I can afford it. I don‚Äôt know much about buying a house nor do I feel confident enough in a city to buy one, so still renting for now. My rent is 2.3k here, and would be much higher in a place like SD. I‚Äôm hoping to get a decent raise soon that would be closer to $200k, but not sure if it‚Äôs gonna play out yet or not.   Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Please be gentle because I know ARK was a mistake and I‚Äôm trying to do the right things now. I‚Äôm trying to get out of the mindset of recovering my losses through investments, and would like to be able to live more peacefully and not check the market every day.

[If Core CPI is sticky, why not fed consider "madman theory"? (i.e: rate hike to 10%, but only temporary),;,; **TLDR: Why not Fed rate hike to 10%, but only with conditions of possible quick rate cuts to 2-3% for sure, and potential QE, if warranted?**   =============================================================  So first of all I dont have Ph D in economics or not even remotely close, so bear with my ignorance.   Going to what I want to say, and as we have witnessed that headline CPI is plummeted significantly in last 6 months, but core CPI is rather sticky and hold the line quite well. In fact, when looking at truflation data, CPI is creeping up in to 2.6% last 2 weeks.   With this in mind, core CPI is more about service industry (i.e: travel/insurance/housing/medical expense) that often doesnt have strong basis for cost of goods sold. Unlike manufacturing jobs, service industry has no strong hold for consensus in terms of pricing.   For example, it's like Amazon Prime membership that used to be 99$ before pre-pandemic. AMZN says it's increasing membership fee due to reason X,Y,Z but it all depends on how they net out the profits from online activity as well. What about Amazon's prime membership costs 140$, but Costco membership costs 120$? Who sets this up and for what reasons?   Having said that, why not Fed consider madman's theory? Like let's say Fed officially announce that it may rate hike to 10% but only with multiple condition 1) that it will rate hike to 10% in next 4 months 2) depending on outcome of macro economy (i.e job reports/CPI/etc), it may not only reduce rate to 2%, but start to do QE if needed.  This will, obviously, bring chaos to financial markets (short term treasury rate will spike) and inevitable market corrections. This will also force many bankruptcy for leveraged business and many negative consequences to real economy. But, I believe that this will restore fed's credibility, which is the most important strategic assets to have in financial markets.    But who actually trusts Fed today? Dont we all clearly remember that in late 2021, Fed expecting to rate hike, maybe early 2023? And we all know what happens in 2022.   Like I am just so sick of one day that Morgan Stanley's talking about recession only to find out that next day Goldman Sachs talking about removal of hard landing. And this isn't much different than what we hear about governors of Fed says otherwise like one day Fed member says we are at the top of rate hike, but other day, another fed member says we should rate hike one or more.      Current rate is 5.25 to 5.5% fed fund rate.   Last CPI was 3.2% (headline) and 4.7% (Core), so current Fed rate is already high enough than Core CPI, isn't it? **According to Taylor's Rule, it should curb core CPI, but wouldn't it be painless if we can curb the expectations of inflation in a timely manner (rather quickly) than "sit down and let's see what it will happen".**   Do I believe rate hike to 10% will increase the chance to crash the economy? Sure, that's why Fed should provide conditions such as quick rate cut to 2% if macros are proven to be crashing down. If that's factored in, maybe, the resilient economy that Fed members talk about all the time won't tank down as severe as they would think, which is why Fed can mention another conditions that they will (not could) do QE, IF needed.   Just my thinking, but I wanted to see what other folks think about this as well. ,;,; 2023-08-20 01:56:02]

[Amazon's Willingness to Lose Money in the is Key to Its Long-Term Success,;,; I believe Amazon's success can be attributed to its willingness to invest heavily in its businesses, even if it means operating at a loss.

It would be easier to please some funds and stop spending money like crazy buying more planes to expand their air network, etc. But this is the correct way to be relevant in 50 years IMO  Other companies can learn from Amazon's example and prioritize long-term growth over short-term gains to build successful businesses that last.

[Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,;,; From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/apple-to-spend-billions-more-on-entertainment-7370447)  "Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.  KEY TAKEAWAYS Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.  The company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.  Previously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.  The move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.  Apple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release.   The company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.  The company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.   The new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).   Apple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.   So far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.  Apple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year.   In each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.  Apple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed."  Personally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.,;,; 2023-03-28 09:43:30]

There was a significant increase in net income, showing growth from a loss of $2.03 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. This highlights a remarkable improvement in Amazon's financial performance and operational efficiency.        2.

In the three months ending June 30, 2022, the company's investments in property and equipment amounted to $15.72 billion, which decreased to $11.45 billion in the same period in 2023. While the absolute values decreased, these investments are essential for the company's long-term growth and expansion.        3. Financing Activities:    The financing activities section details Amazon's capital structure and shareholder returns. The company engaged in various financing activities, including repurchasing common stock, resulting in cash outflows of $3.33 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2023, and $6 billion in the six months ending June 30, 2022. Additionally, the company obtained proceeds from short-term debt and other financing, contributing $4.87 billion and $4.4 billion in the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. Investors should be aware of these activities, as they impact the company's capital allocation strategy.        4. Cash Position:    Amazon maintained a strong cash position, reflecting its financial stability and liquidity. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased steadily over the periods, reaching $50.07 billion at the end of the twelve months ending June 30, 2023. This signifies the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations and pursue growth opportunities.        5. Debt and Interest Payments:    The company managed its debt obligations efficiently, making principal repayments on long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations. Amazon also paid interest on debt, with cash outflows totaling $349 million and $954 million for the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. These payments demonstrate responsible debt management and the company's commitment to meeting its financial obligations.        6. Net Sales:    Net sales are a fundamental indicator of Amazon's revenue growth and market performance. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, net sales reached $121.23 billion, which increased to $134.38 billion in the same period in 2023, representing an 11% year-over-year growth. Similarly, for the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net sales grew from $237.68 billion to $261.74 billion, showing strong and consistent revenue growth.        7. Operating Expenses:    Operating expenses provide insights into the company's cost structure and efficiency. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, operating expenses were $117.92 billion, which increased to $126.70 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating expenses increased from $230.69 billion to $249.29 billion, primarily due to higher fulfillment, technology, and infrastructure costs. Despite the increase, Amazon's revenue growth outpaced the rise in operating expenses, leading to improved operating income.        8. Operating Income:    Operating income measures the profitability of Amazon's core operations. The company experienced significant growth in operating income, increasing from $3.32 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to $7.68 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating income rose from $6.99 billion to $12.46 billion, indicating improved operational efficiency and profitability.        9. Non-Operating Expense:    The non-operating expense provides insights into Amazon's other income and expenses outside its core operations. Total non-operating expense decreased from ($5.97) billion to ($0.12) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. This decline was primarily due to a positive swing in other income (expense), net, indicating favorable financial management.        10. Net Income (Loss):    Net income is a critical metric that assesses Amazon's overall financial performance. The company experienced a significant improvement in net income, increasing from a loss of ($2.03) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net income increased from a loss of ($5.87) billion to a profit of $9.92 billion, demonstrating a strong financial turnaround.        11. Earnings Per Share (EPS):    Earnings per share is a vital metric for shareholders, as it represents the company's profitability on a per-share basis. Basic earnings per share increased from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.66 for the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. Diluted earnings per share showed similar growth, rising from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.65 for the same periods.        12. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):    Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items that impact the company's financial position but are not part of the net income calculation. For the three months ending June 30, 2022, Amazon's other comprehensive income was ($2.42) billion, which increased to $293 million for the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, other comprehensive income was ($3.41) billion and $807 million, respectively.        13. Comprehensive Income (Loss):    Comprehensive income is the total change in equity during a period, including net income and other comprehensive income. For the three months ending June 30, 2022, Amazon reported a comprehensive loss of ($4.45) billion, which improved to a comprehensive income of $7.04 billion for the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, comprehensive loss improved from ($9.28) billion to a comprehensive income of $8.33 billion, highlighting the company's financial recovery.        14. Segment Information:    Amazon operates through several segments, including North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, all segments showed significant growth in net sales.        ‚Ä¢	North America: Net sales in North America increased from $80.85 billion to $87.75 billion, representing a 9% year-over-year growth.    ‚Ä¢	International: Net sales in the International segment grew from $31.9 billion to $37.4 billion, reflecting a 17% year-over-year growth.    ‚Ä¢	AWS: Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud computing segment, experienced remarkable growth, with net sales increasing from $16.37 billion to $20.2 billion, showing a 23% year-over-year growth.        Conclusion:    Amazon demonstrated robust financial performance and growth in the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. The company's operating activities generated positive cash flow, and net sales increased consistently across all segments. Investments in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions reflect Amazon's focus on long-term growth and expansion.        Although the financing activities included cash outflows related to stock repurchases, the company's strong cash position and responsible debt management position Amazon well for future growth. The substantial improvement in net income and operating income signifies improved financial performance and operational efficiency.                PROs &amp; CONs:    Pros:        ‚Ä¢	Strong Revenue Growth: Amazon has consistently demonstrated strong revenue growth across its various segments. The company's ability to expand its customer base, introduce new products and services, and leverage its e-commerce platform has led to impressive financial performance.    ‚Ä¢	Diversification of Business Segments: Amazon has successfully diversified its business beyond e-commerce. The expansion into cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been a major growth driver, providing the company with a stable and profitable source of revenue.    ‚Ä¢	Innovative and Customer-Centric Approach: Amazon's relentless focus on customer satisfaction, innovative technologies like Amazon Prime, and personalized shopping experiences have helped the company build a loyal customer base and maintain a competitive edge in the market.    ‚Ä¢	Financial Stability and Liquidity: The company maintains a strong cash position and prudent debt management, providing it with the financial flexibility to invest in new ventures and navigate economic uncertainties.    ‚Ä¢	Global Reach: Amazon operates in numerous countries, allowing it to tap into diverse markets and consumer preferences worldwide. Its vast international presence positions the company for further growth and market dominance.    ‚Ä¢	Leading Cloud Service Provider: AWS is a dominant force in the cloud computing industry, serving a wide range of clients, from startups to large enterprises. The profitability and growth of AWS contribute significantly to Amazon's overall financial success.        Cons:        ‚Ä¢	Regulatory Scrutiny: Amazon faces increasing regulatory scrutiny related to its market dominance and business practices. Antitrust concerns and accusations of unfair competition may lead to potential legal challenges and fines.    ‚Ä¢	Labor Practices: The company has faced criticism for its labor practices, including allegations of poor working conditions and treatment of employees at its fulfillment centers. Such negative publicity can impact Amazon's reputation and may affect its ability to attract and retain talent.    ‚Ä¢	Highly Competitive Markets: The e-commerce and cloud computing industries are highly competitive, with major players vying for market share. Amazon faces challenges from established competitors and emerging startups, requiring continuous investment in innovation and technology.    ‚Ä¢	Dependence on Global Supply Chain: Amazon's vast supply chain network is critical for delivering products to customers. Any disruptions, such as those caused by geopolitical events or natural disasters, could affect the company's operations and financial performance.    ‚Ä¢	Profit Margins: While Amazon experiences strong revenue growth, its profit margins have historically been relatively low. Intense competition and ongoing investments in new ventures can put pressure on the company's profitability.    ‚Ä¢	Environmental Impact: As a large-scale retailer and cloud services provider, Amazon's operations have an environmental impact. The company has faced criticism for its carbon footprint, and there are growing expectations from stakeholders for more significant efforts towards sustainability.    TLDR;    Amazon recent earnings report for the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, reveals a robust financial performance and impressive revenue growth across its segments. The company generated positive cash flow from operating activities, showing a significant increase in net income, indicating improved financial health and operational efficiency. Amazon's strategic investments in property, equipment, and acquisitions demonstrate a focus on long-term growth and expansion. With a strong cash position and responsible debt management, the company exhibits financial stability and flexibility. However, regulatory scrutiny, labor practices, and intense competition pose potential challenges. Despite these, Amazon remains a leading player in the e-commerce and cloud computing industries, presenting attractive prospects for investors seeking exposure to a market-dominant, innovative, and customer-centric company with a history of success and growth.    ,;,; 2023-08-04 00:03:33]

[20 stocks till 2049 - buy and hold for 25 years,;,; Hello. Apologies if this has already been posted in this community.   I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.  https://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e  The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.  So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold.   So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049.   Here is my list so far.   1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 ) 2. Costco 3. Johnson and Johnson 4. Waste Management 5. CVS 6. Home Depot 7. Boeing 8. Caterpillar 9. GE Aerospace 10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia 11. Walmart/Target 12. Starbucks / McDonalds 13. UPS 14. JP Morgan / Bank of America 15. Berkshire / Markel 16. Disney 17. Tesla / GM 18. Hershey 19. Dollar General 20. Lockheed Martin  Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate.   Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.  Edit: Some really good points in the comments.   1. Most of my regular investing goes to VOO. Think of this as a fun little experiment  2. Since all of these are mature large companies, maybe it makes more sense to go with mid cap stocks. In that case, what would you pick?,;,; 2024-01-18 21:13:00]
[All Public Pensions Funds Are Around 25 Percent Of Their Proclaimed Net Assets - Especially Calpers,;,; When are the members of public pension ever going to figure out that   the numbers that they get are not accurate.    if amazon stock trades at 100x earnings. Obviously this equity, which is representative of the entire stock market for its absurd valuation so far beyond its actual earning capability is a mockery of the intention of equity markets.    on the balance sheet of the pension fund it has a "paper gain"   meaning the stock trades at 100x earnings so on paper the equity trades at 200 per share but in reality, it is really worth 25 x earnings due to its 15 percent growth rate, and not the highest quality management.    that means that if interest rates were ever competitive than the price of the stock would effectively be cut by 75 percent, meaning the balance sheet of CALPERS, the California teachers pension fund would be in tatters. The reason is that these companies do not have earnings that substantiate their market caps.   NONE of them do.   For whatever reason the fiduciaries of Calpers have not told their membership that in order for their pension to be good, they need to have investments.    To have investments, you need to be allowed to make investments.    you cannot make investments without FREE FLOATING DEBT   Meaning, you need a free market with debt. Or else, then the stock market gets so much capital that it becomes uninvestable, which is exactly what happened.   Yet, the calpers financial management, act like its 2003, when there was a free market in debt.   This is like reminiscent of bernie madoff style scam.    The reason is the debt markets were socialized.    You cannot have investments without price discovery   Hilarious enough, the people who complain about "wealth inequality" have    literally without exaggeration, made it impossible to get earnings from bank deposits and the stock market because THEY and also the republicans did not protest strongly, for a SUSPENSION of FREE FLOATING INTEREST RATES.   LITERALLY INTEREST RATE PRICE CONTROLS.   So,thereby making money worthless for investment.   Anyone who buys an equity today like amazon will VIRTUALLY NEVER get a return from the stock in their LIFETIME.   WHY haven't pension fund managers who get paid millions of dollars a year tell their membership that their pensions are threatened and COMPLETELY unsustainable without having free floating interest rates?   This is criminal level negligence. They continue drawing their checks as if nothing is awry.   Some estimates indicate that Calpers is in reality only 25 percent funded.     Why is this not in the public square yet? It's obvious when looking at STRATOSPHERIC valuations,;,; 2024-01-30 14:16:18]

[FEPI Looking like a better JEPQ. 25% yield, solid price performance,;,; If you're a fan of JEPQ/JEPI, keep an eye on FEPI.  It looks like it's shaping up to be an even better alternative.  By selling calls on targeted stocks it seems like it's able to generate more income than the JEPI/JEPQ approach.  There is some additional risk because it's a stock selection, rather than an approximation of the index.  But these are big name stocks. . .

[Buy high or find something else?,;,; Hello everyone.  I promise this is not a "I have $X to invest" post.  I'm curious about the investment strategy of buying high when it's a good company.  For examples, look at Microsoft, Amazon, Eli Lilly, and Nvidia.  All at very high points.  Hitting new all time highs even.  In theory, my heart says if you truly believe in the company and that the stock will go up, then buying high isn't a problem.  But my brain is just like, NO, it'll clearly go down.  You never buy high lol.  So what do YOU all do?  Do you have a favorite stock that you buy more of no matter how high it gets? Or do you just enjoy the ride with what you have and look for something else to invest in?  I do have some small positions in those four companies, which is why I'm familiar with them. Clearly I'm comfortable enough with them to hold the shares I have. But my brain is just so wired to not buy high at peaks.  I've read a decent amount of different strategies and things to look for, but I've never really seen anything about a successful company and buying high.  I know it could be a little subjective too. Depends on your age and risk tolerance and things like that and what you are looking for, but I guess I'm just trying to go for a more General approach in this question. But in an effort to help if people want, I'm mid 30s, married, kids on the way. Have a good job and not worry about retirement. My personal investing is to try to Simply make money for me and the family for stuff like trips and fixing the house and things like that, so risk tolerance is fairly high.  TL:DR I guess you could boil this down to a simple question.  "When is it too late to jump on the train?"  Thank you.,;,; 2024-02-16 15:46:24]
[S&amp;p 500 Tech vs NASDAQ 100 vs Stocks for AI,;,; Greetings!     I wanna invest into AI and cant decide whats the best call there. I think most will agree that the best bet for AI is to invest into the Big Companys: Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Meta, Google and Amazon. (Tesla not included because i dont like Elon tbh).     Investing into S&amp;P Tech will give me big Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA but not the other companys. Investing into NASDAQ 100 will give me all of them, but with a lower Rate (can be good can be bad). And of course i just can buy those 6 Stocks.     I think Apple (even if they dont have LLMs yet) will be big in AI in 1-2 Years and the capability shipping local AI on all of their devices are insane.  Huge potential here + we talk about Apple. Microsoft is playing the AI game better than anyone else right now and coming GPT Versions will slap. I also like the new approach of Meta and with LLAMA there is also huge Potential. NVIDIA is of course also a no brainer (even if some ppl think they are overvalued), they are way ahead of other companys like AMD right now. Amazon while not having insane LLMs right now, has of course on of the best Sectors to apply AI in general.     With alphabet i have to say, im not so sure. Their new Model is strong, but i kinda didn't feel good about the company as a whole. Hard to explain why.      What would you do and why if AI is the goal ? Just buy the Stocks or ETFs ?     &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-07-25 10:23:54]
[1 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,;,; Last year there was a post asking what folks were doing to profit from the current/upcoming recession on Hacker News: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33040211](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33040211)  I replied ([https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33041751](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33041751)) that I purchased some pandemic stocks, which I started doing in April 2022. Most of my purchasing was through summer 2022, but I've bought others more recently, like Carvana on the dip in December (which luckily popped since it became a meme stock), as well as Meta, Amazon and Google on the dips in October. The most recent was Allbirds on the dip in March since I had just purchased the shoes and they quickly became my favorite.  Overall, I'm up 36%, but as you can imagine a few winners (which I luckily have larger stakes in) make up for the losers. My target timeline is \~3 years, and we could still see a deeper recession from a hard landing, so I plan to post more annual updates.  There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I've summarized each with the overall unrealized gain/loss so far as of this morning:  * Affirm: -11.33% * Amazon: +25.25% * Allbirds: +9.43% * Coinbase: -34.32% * Carvana: +306.5% * Google: +29.35% * Meta: +170.89% * Cloudflare: +14.35% * Netflix: +97.08% * Peloton: -54.61% * Roblox: +25.14% * Shopify: +39.26% * Snapchat: +3.21% * Snowflake: +11.14% * Unity: +8.91%  **Some commentary**  It's hard to convey how much of a roller coaster the the last 12 months have been, with some pretty large negative swings that I just had to watch and not react to. There are likely more to come, especially since it seems a lot of the potential good news is already priced in.  Interestingly, in that post I mentioned Peloton was one I regretted almost instantly, and is now my worst performer by far. Unfortunately, greed got the best of me and I caught that falling knife buying a few times as the stock dropped further. I was hoping they would get rid of the excess inventory, improve distribution and double down on subscriptions to turn things around, but that hasn't materialized. Maybe it still will, or they get acquired.  Despite the strong gains, I still feel Shopify (improved focus, strong brand), Netflix (new ad tier, other new streaming services struggling and likely to go back to content), and Meta (improved targeting post privacy changes + AI opportunities) still have good upside potential.  I also really like Microsoft due to their enterprise moat and opportunities with AI, but their stock never had the correction the other stocks did and that was the scent I was chasing at the time (right or wrong). But long-term, I also wonder if AI will negate the need for human productivity software since the AI can just do it and review/edit mode requires less bloat (e.g. video with Final Cut Pro vs. TikTok, or images with Photoshop vs. Instagram). I wouldn't doubt if we see an AI-native productivity suite that doesn't just integrate AI, but predicated on simplfy reviewing AI generated content.  I'm disappointed to have missed Nvidia (up 3X since October) since I used to own it and have been watching it since the crypto bust created excess inventory and a predictable dip, then the AI trend led to the recovery. The valuation feels rich, but could easily grow into it given the trajectory of AI, unless the hyperscalers make their own chips.  Perhaps counterintuitively, it seems it's more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts than financial analysts/stock pickers since, at the end of the day, you need to make your own decisions about the fundamentals and prospects of the business. Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but by definition backward looking while valuation is forward looking.  I'm curious to see how these perform if the US enters a broader recession in the next 18 months. I don't plan to sell unless something catastrophic happens and I see a better opportunity to shift to.  **Update \~6mo later here:** https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/,;,; 2023-06-12 19:18:14]
[Is there anything to stop an ETF from becoming "too overvalued"?,;,; Since ETFs are easy to buy and have super low fees, they are an attractive option for people.  If I have $1000 and want to easy access to cheap, diversified stocks, I can buy any number of S&amp;P500 or total market ETFs in a couple clicks.  I'll use ticker SPY for this example.  If enough people do this, if would seem like the price could be driven up, beyond (and eventually, far beyond) the price of the underlying assets.  I spendy $1000 today, and looking at the info page on my broker, I am roughly entitled to $70 of Apple, $65 of Amazon, on down the line until I have $0.002 of some other company, all totalling $1000.  Someone else comes along and buys SPY, buy since I've bought the shares I did, they end spending $1000.45 on the next available shares.  If a few million people do this, and people aren't willing to sell SPY at the same price, theoretically, you could see the lowest shares available going up, say to $1200 for the same assets... despite the underlying shares only having moved a little.  At some point, I'd think it could be a problem.  Even if people are just overpaying a few percent.  Could this happen in real life?  Does it?  If it doesn't, what is preventing it?,;,; 2023-11-26 19:51:52]

I don't think other big tech (Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS) giants will order more GPUs because running a general-purpose GPU is very expensive: [Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company.

Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family.      Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.  And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers.     Small businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud capacities (mostly Google because of their TPU's low power-to-cost ratio).      The rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent.      **\[Conclusions\]:** Their a moderate-low probability Q4 revenues will reach a plateau of around 15-20 billion.  A moderate probability that they will be below 15 billion. A low probability of exceeding 20 billion.  &amp;#x200B;  ***Let's sidestep to AI marker TAM topic,***        [*Meanwhile, looking forward to 2027, the server market's value is estimated at a staggering $195.6 billion.*](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-ai-and-hpc-gpu-sales-reportedly-approached-half-a-million-units-in-q3-thanks-to-meta-facebook)   However, this estimated revenue will be brought by those who rent AI processing capacities like AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud providers. And not ChatGPT clones. The market has not figured yet the TAM (total addressable market) of services like ChatGPT.       However, I try to speculate on [open numbers](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users), which have stagnated for the last 6 months.      100 million monthly active users \* 10$ per subscription produces 1 billion in revenue.    [The average cost of 1 query from a used is 4 cents](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/).     A single user runs 2,000 queries per month on average. The query is a single text message you send to the chatbot.      2000 \* 0.04 = 80 $ to service 1 user per month.    Until the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month.    No wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription.  It doesn't seem sustainable.     Last note,  the majority of data centers upgrade their equipment every 4-5 years. So, if AI expectations won't burst, and chip efficiency improves 10-fold, and other chip makers won't catch up, don't expect big tech to re-stock their chips earlier than the end of 2027.      &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2024-01-21 22:17:52]

[Is an Investment in Nvidia a good idea?,;,; Join the discussion and discover the compelling reasons behind this optimistic outlook.  Reasons for NVIDIA Share Increase:  Cutting-edge Technology: NVIDIA is at the forefront of groundbreaking technology, like artificial intelligence (AI) and graphics processing units (GPUs). Here's why it matters: NVIDIA's AI advancements have the power to transform industries such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and data analytics. Their GPUs dominate the gaming market, offering high-performance hardware that gamers love. Strong Partnerships: NVIDIA has formed strategic alliances with major tech giants, including Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, unlocking exciting opportunities: Collaborations with these influential companies put NVIDIA at the center of emerging technologies like cloud computing and machine learning. NVIDIA's recent acquisition of ARM Holdings gives them an even greater advantage in the semiconductor industry. Expanding into New Markets: NVIDIA's reach extends beyond gaming and AI, entering exciting sectors that are gaining momentum: Cryptocurrency mining has seen a significant surge, increasing the demand for NVIDIA GPUs, which boosts their sales and revenue. NVIDIA's focus on the automotive industry, developing advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technology, positions them as a key player in the future of transportation. Impressive Financial Performance: NVIDIA has a track record of delivering strong financial results, which bodes well for future growth: Consistent revenue and profit growth over the years demonstrate NVIDIA's ability to deliver solid financial outcomes, which may attract more investors. The company's robust cash flow allows for continued investment in research and development, ensuring they stay ahead of the competition.

[Should I stay in blue chip/ETF combination for long-term investing?,;,; In 2021, I received an inheritance. At the time, I invested around 20% of that inheritance into each of the following: Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, and VTI.        I since then have learned that diversifying and index/ETF funds are a safer way to go for long-term investing, which is definitely my goal. And I'm still around 20% in VTI.         But with that in mind, I don't know if I should necessarily sell off any stock from the four tech companies right now. I could, and put that money into index/ETF, but they are all now turning some profit and mostly seem like safe companies at the moment.        Again, I now know diversifying is key and index/ETF are safer moving forward, but at this point with where I currently am, what actions would you recommend?,;,; 2023-08-08 17:18:07]

[Is the IT industry experiencing a growth spurt, or is this a bubble?,;,; Bernard Arnault, the head of LVMH, may be the wealthiest individual in the world, but IT companies still hold the title of the most valuable. Even following the recent market adjustment, **Apple** boasts a valuation exceeding $2.6 trillion, with **Microsoft** at $2.34 trillion, and **Alphabet** at $1.56 trillion.  How can this be? **Don't large tech firms also face the threat of economic downturns?**  Indeed, they do. However, the members of the MAMAA conglomerate (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet) took proactive measures to prepare for a potential economic slowdown by decreasing spending, which included a **reduction in labor costs**...  The recent **turbulence in the U.S. banking sector** has further funneled funds into the tech industry. Investors have shown a preference for companies boasting substantial profit margins and large cash reserves over more traditional safe-haven assets.  Another factor driving growth has been the **surge in Artificial Intelligence**. Investors anticipate that the capital injected into this sector will yield increased sales and, subsequently, elevated profits. Microsoft, for instance, anticipates a 6.7 percent revenue increase in the current quarter due to the rising demand for AI solutions.  Heading into 2023, the IT sector strikes a somewhat subdued chord: the Nasdaq Index suffered a decline of almost 33% in 2022. However, with **decreasing inflation** and the **prospect of a pause in Fed rate hikes**, tech stocks have regained their allure.  One also should not forget to note that key support propping up Nasdaq members was **stock buybacks**. Recall, too, that both Alphabet and Apple recently announced buybacks amounting to $70 billion and $90 billion respectively. Additionally, Meta, formerly Facebook, announced a stock buyback of $40 billion.  What lies on the horizon? **What are the analysts' predictions?**  Michael Landsberg, Chief Investment Officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management, asserts that [large tech stocks are currently overvalued](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/megacap-tech-stocks-out-of-control-big-tech-still-has-the-power-to-extend-the-rally-and-weather-an-economic-storm-analysts-say-a60b6bc3). For example, Microsoft shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 34.3, while Amazon's PE ratio (TTM) stands at 273.79.  On the other hand, analysts at Bank of America [do not foresee any reason for alarm](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/worries-over-big-tech-driving-135954915.html), and they predict that the flourishing market will persist.  So **what should we anticipate next?** If the Fed deviates from its hawkish stance, the rally could possibly extend. If not, the recent market correction may appear minor in comparison to what could transpire. Additionally, the approaching debt ceiling deadline could provoke another stock market adjustment, as new Treasury debt issuance could drain Fed reserves and curtail liquidity.,;,; 2023-05-24 15:02:49]

[Just how big are the Magnificent Seven?,;,; This is a big quote from MarketWatch. I‚Äôve seen the numbers before, but this really gave me pause.   &gt; These captains of the SS S&amp;P 500 are Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. They've been described as the magnificent seven by many news organizations. Fortunately for me, there's a common thread among this group. They are the only U.S. companies that have ever been valued at a trillion dollars by the public markets. To say these companies are dominating the S&amp;P 500 is a giant understatement. Last year, their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S&amp;P 500's valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65% of the Index's market cap gain last year, despite comprising just 1.4% of its components. But doesn't this go against the main reason behind investing in S&amp;P 500 index funds? Wouldn't the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed?  &gt; Phil Van Dorn: Well, I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry, traditionally, you might be looking at expenses of 1% of assets under management per year, and that can really pile up over time. But with an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund, your expenses get close to zero. But as you have mentioned when you called the group of expensive stocks the Trillionaires' Club, a small group of companies now make up between 27 and 30% of the S&amp;P 500 depending on which day you look at it.  &gt; Jeremy Owens: Right, so that's seven out of 500 companies accounting for more than a quarter or less than a third of the entire market cap of the S&amp;P 500 and really swaying the underlying metrics. What should an investor kind of take from this and how should we look at the S&amp;P 500 moving forward, knowing how much these companies matter?  &gt; Phil Van Dorn: One can say that there's a heck of a lot of risk in the seven companies that make up only 1% of the S&amp;P 500, but make up close to a third of its value. However, the S&amp;P 500 is self-correcting. It rewards success.,;,; 2024-01-20 00:51:08]
[Negative cash cycle businesses?,;,; What are some businesses with a negative cash cycle? I know about AMZN, but I've never really researched this issue specifically. I'm curious if there are entire business segments that have a negative cash cycle, or whether this is specific to some individual companies (e.g., eBay, Amazon). Also curious to know whether some companies would be able to quickly and easily pivot to a negative cash cycle, e.g., by reducing investments &amp; R&amp;D.,;,; 2023-03-20 18:25:53]
[Who believes inflation is over?,;,; Inflation seems to have fallen out of the headlines recently given the lower CPI readings in the past few months. The market seems to be pricing a pretty significant decline in interest rates based on the forward SOFR curve. Does anyone think this not right?  Just log on to your Amazon account and have a look at items you bought in 2020 or early 2021. Every single item that I have bought has increased 25% to 100%+ in the past 3 years. You see it at Costco, you see it at restaurants.  Wage growth has only really occurred on a percentage basis for the lower skilled minimum wage job, and nowhere enough to cover the massive cost of living increases.  Is wage price inflation off the table because people are too scared of losing their jobs? Do people just accept a lower standard of living than before?  I can really only see inflation going away if people accept a lower standard of living and not push for higher wages.  EDIT: Not saying inflation is going to 0%, but I'm thinking it's too early to assume we are headed back down to 2% and the job is done. I think it's way more likely we stay in this 4% to 5% range or even head higher from here if wage inflation starts to kick in because people are not content with the diminished buying power.,;,; 2023-05-29 18:21:31]
[Has anyone heard that a portfolio balanced equally by sector will beat the S&amp;P 500 over time?,;,; I was just speaking with a (potential) financial advisor today. He discussed, for example how the S&amp;P 500 is way overweighted in tech, particularly because 7 of the top 10 holdings are all megatech giants: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, Google/Alphabet (twice), and Tesla. These 7 alone make up 21% of the value of the S&amp;P 500.  Obviously, this leads to underweighting in other sectors. And this leads to underperformance and increased volatility over long periods of time. As evidence of this, he brought up a chart that showed that if you equally weight your investments across the various sectors (financials, materials, utilities, healthcare, etc.), that it would outperform the S&amp;P 500, provided that you rebalance periodically.  Has anyone heard of an investment portfolio like this? I did a little research, and it looks like for periods of 15 years or greater, this is right - an portfolio that's equally weighted by sector, and rebalanced periodically, will outperform the S&amp;P by 1.5% to 2% annually.  I'd love to hear your thoughts about this. Anyone have a portfolio like this? Is there some kind of equal weighting ETF or mutual fund that does this automatically? Thanks.,;,; 2023-02-28 09:15:41]
[Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market?,;,; Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market? I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity.  Then, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want.     It goes on and on. Looking at Palantir which trades at a crazy multiple, or basically any software company, yes it's possible to buy Palantir or any stock and it triple, but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words, Real INVESTING seems to be literally impossible right now.     Even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline.      And there are questions like how is this possible and is this partly due to extremely irresponsible Fed reserve activity mainly due to QE pushing valuations to their highest levels ever. Also do the people here think that this is the worst investing environment ever when compared to historical pe ratios?,;,; 2024-02-13 14:28:31]
[How many individual stocks in your eyes is too much?,;,; Out of curiosity how many individual stocks in your eyes is too much?   My train of thought behind my pickings is that I allocate the majority of my money to a world index so I‚Äôm not overweighting a particular sector or region but then allocate a small portion of my funds to individual stocks that I personally use day to day and have high confidence in.  For reference, 66% of my money is tied up in a world index (VWRL). 12% is tied up in small cap index funds. 50% in USA and 50% in Europe. (ZPRV and ZPRX)  11% is tied up in individual stocks. The list of stocks are:  Amazon - I use this quite frequently since I‚Äôm a member.  Apple - I use their tech.  Microsoft - familiar with their business model and use their software such as word and PowerPoint.  Meta - I use instagram and WhatsApp, I don‚Äôt use Facebook but its power in advertising is immense.  Johnson &amp; Johnson - leader in health such as vaccines.  Visa &amp; Mastercard - I personally use Mastercard but both are identical and leaders.  Alphabet - I use their software.  AMD - gaming as they‚Äôre used in Xbox and PlayStation plus their future in AI. Taking market share from intel.  Berkshire Hathaway - diversified  McDonald‚Äôs - real estate company that sells food.  JP Morgan - leading bank that is diversified.  Caterpillar - leading manufacture in mining/ agriculture/ construction machinery. Plus I‚Äôve got a placement sorted with them so there‚Äôs a bit of bias lol.  Nvidia - leader in AI and GPU production.  Walmart - powerhouse in America.  Costco - their membership model is cash flow powerhouse plus they‚Äôre present in numerous countries.  Waste management - trash will always be here.  ASML - absolute gem of a company and many years ahead of any competitors. Every tech company is reliant on them.  Airbus - I love planes and their business is far more desirable than Boeing.  Lockheed Martin - peace was never an option.  Once again, I‚Äôve chose to invest into these companies individually as I want to overweigh them as I‚Äôm more confident in them than others. I‚Äôm willing to put my money where my mouth is. I‚Äôm aware they‚Äôre contained in the world index. I don‚Äôt do any technical analysis, it‚Äôs all confidence and familiarity.  I also invest in REITs, I invest into leading REITs in each sector such as industrial, data etc. 11% of my portfolio is in REITs. 10 in total. I use alreits to track them, and track them quarterly.  I don‚Äôt plan on selling until retirement. Currently 19.  Thanks.,;,; 2024-02-17 17:00:00]

[If Core CPI is sticky, why not fed consider "madman theory"? (i.e: rate hike to 10%, but only temporary),;,; **TLDR: Why not Fed rate hike to 10%, but only with conditions of possible quick rate cuts to 2-3% for sure, and potential QE, if warranted?**   =============================================================  So first of all I dont have Ph D in economics or not even remotely close, so bear with my ignorance.   Going to what I want to say, and as we have witnessed that headline CPI is plummeted significantly in last 6 months, but core CPI is rather sticky and hold the line quite well. In fact, when looking at truflation data, CPI is creeping up in to 2.6% last 2 weeks.   With this in mind, core CPI is more about service industry (i.e: travel/insurance/housing/medical expense) that often doesnt have strong basis for cost of goods sold. Unlike manufacturing jobs, service industry has no strong hold for consensus in terms of pricing.   For example, it's like Amazon Prime membership that used to be 99$ before pre-pandemic. AMZN says it's increasing membership fee due to reason X,Y,Z but it all depends on how they net out the profits from online activity as well. What about Amazon's prime membership costs 140$, but Costco membership costs 120$? Who sets this up and for what reasons?   Having said that, why not Fed consider madman's theory? Like let's say Fed officially announce that it may rate hike to 10% but only with multiple condition 1) that it will rate hike to 10% in next 4 months 2) depending on outcome of macro economy (i.e job reports/CPI/etc), it may not only reduce rate to 2%, but start to do QE if needed.  This will, obviously, bring chaos to financial markets (short term treasury rate will spike) and inevitable market corrections. This will also force many bankruptcy for leveraged business and many negative consequences to real economy. But, I believe that this will restore fed's credibility, which is the most important strategic assets to have in financial markets.    But who actually trusts Fed today? Dont we all clearly remember that in late 2021, Fed expecting to rate hike, maybe early 2023? And we all know what happens in 2022.   Like I am just so sick of one day that Morgan Stanley's talking about recession only to find out that next day Goldman Sachs talking about removal of hard landing. And this isn't much different than what we hear about governors of Fed says otherwise like one day Fed member says we are at the top of rate hike, but other day, another fed member says we should rate hike one or more.      Current rate is 5.25 to 5.5% fed fund rate.   Last CPI was 3.2% (headline) and 4.7% (Core), so current Fed rate is already high enough than Core CPI, isn't it? **According to Taylor's Rule, it should curb core CPI, but wouldn't it be painless if we can curb the expectations of inflation in a timely manner (rather quickly) than "sit down and let's see what it will happen".**   Do I believe rate hike to 10% will increase the chance to crash the economy? Sure, that's why Fed should provide conditions such as quick rate cut to 2% if macros are proven to be crashing down. If that's factored in, maybe, the resilient economy that Fed members talk about all the time won't tank down as severe as they would think, which is why Fed can mention another conditions that they will (not could) do QE, IF needed.   Just my thinking, but I wanted to see what other folks think about this as well. ,;,; 2023-08-20 01:56:02]

I am 27 and have a generally pretty boring portfolio with splits as follows:  1) VOO - 45%  2) VT - 40%  3) Individual stocks - 10% (lot of EV stocks since i have passion for them (especially rivian), as well as holdovers like GE, amazon, disney from investing prior to committing everything to ETFs)  4) DRIV - 5% (again, electric car nut, know its redundant, but nice to have a lot of the EV market outside of RIVN in an ETF, even if it is pretty top heavy with Google, etc.)  Know the overlap between VOO and VT, but when I started investing in ETFs, I was exclusively buying VOO. As I learned more, found out that I liked some exposure to international and small caps, but not enough to VT and chill lol.   Recently, I have been having a strong desire to be more aggressive. I dont know if I am just falling into the trap of wanting to stray from "boring" investing, and end up shooting myself in the foot.   Would love to hear from you all if I should just maintain a holding pattern, or if I am missing something important in my portfolio for somebody my age who is actually pretty risk tolerant? Appreciate you all!,;,; 2023-08-07 20:18:57]

[One common mistake of a novice trader,;,; Let's imagine the mindset of beginners. Beginners want to earn quickly, a lot and with minimal effort. And most likely, we know from our experience, they will be quite fearful. So they will choose those instruments that are well-known and have a good reputation. These will probably be stocks of companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple.  **How will beginners add companies to their portfolio?**   Let's specify that the stocks of these companies are not cheap and cost 100-300 dollars. Of course beginners want to fill their portfolio on enthusiasm right now. This means our trader will go to the stock exchange and simply buy them.   **What is wrong with that?**   The point is that you should buy shares of even the seemingly coolest and most famous companies not at any moment of time when you want to, but look at whether it is a good time to enter a position.   **What does good or bad timing mean?**   In investing for 10-15 years the concepts of good and bad time lose their relevance. Because for such a long period of time stocks can fall and rise 100 times.  But if we speak about from 1 to 6 months trading, it is very important to choose the right moment. Because you need to earn money rather quickly and you want to earn more, of course.   For the sake of simplicity let's consider 2 companies: META and AAPL.    Both of them have a beautiful growing chart for the last year of trading, but you should not buy both companies now, if you take them for a short term.   The fact is that META and AAPL stocks are at their all-time highs right now. They have rallied strongly over the past couple months and there will soon be a period when the price will be corrected. Since there is no one chart in the market that is a forever rising straight line. There will always come moments of correction. And if you buy their stocks now, you are very likely to buy at the most expensive price in recent times.   That's why it's important to learn how to analyze charts and choose the moments to buy or sell smartly.,;,; 2024-01-25 18:36:53]

[Is China set for "finally" bottom and an epic rally?,;,; DISCLAIMER: This post can disturb US readers:     What a f\* value evaporation we went through in the last years. China, with the bad press from the US major media and subsequently Markets realigning with US policy (decoupling) left the stock market in the lows. You have companies like $BABA that IPOed at $68 per share on Sept. 14, 2014, and last week this thing was touching that price. But let's compare BABA business and valuation quickly:     |In Millions|2014|2023| |:-|:-|:-| |Revenues|52,504 RMB or $8,463|868,687 RMB or $126,491| |Profits|23,403 RMB or  $3,720 |156,906 RMB or $22,583| |Share Price|\+/- 119$|\+/- 70$|  When China was friendly to the US eyes, the share price of BABA peaked at $300 and I remember that still it was considered a "value play" compared to its peers (FAANG or 7MAG)  China has disappointed the market with news (news from US media, reality is always different) and I beleive not a single news can disspoint investors further other than a very extreme US hollywood-driven wet dream of China invading Taiwan (it won't happen militarily, they follow a different policy with a period of 50 to 100 years planning and execution - as they work on long-term leadership, not 4 years elections circus)  Their economy is still doing better than ours in europe or the US, but they aren't active participants of press releases, conference meeting for the front page of Financial Times or election year where US population take it as a sport match.  * BYD took over TESLA.  * eCommerce in China and South Asia is BABA/Tencent playground moving trillions * They were the first to release 5G and subsequently US had to take them down with some drama story on Huawei  China state intervened their high growth sectors and companies bcuz their CEOs thought that they could monetise on Chinese publicly-funded resources and create an oligopoly equivalent to the US where Googles, Amazons dominate the citizens privacy, freedom and life.

[Investing in software companies (tin foil chat),;,; Wanted to share some thought on how to pick stocks in technology. I want to focus on the quality of revenue. I did t know this until I spoke with a few experts and got me thinking about fraud and if there is a method to spot fraud in technology consistently.   I was brought up in the UK in the 90s and 00s where some managers made a fortune by investing in internet companies. Most of those people were long only investors and the horizon was super long. Their main thesis was around changes in society, habitual changes, that would have led to some internet companies to show abnormal growth in stock price. Amazon, Google, FB, Microsoft etc. These managers literally became millionaires.   The legacy of these managers dies hard and there are many money managers betting on healthcare tech (bio tech), food industries or energy transition. Their bets are almost always driven by top down analysis, instead of understanding the operations of each company. Most of these firms generate their money from licensing.   Licensing revenue has distinct characteristics such as - multi year firm wide contract  - cost of switching tends to be expensive  - once signed, your revenue is basically guaranteed for a good few years   One often overlooked is the fact that companies have a great leeway on when to book/show sales and cancellations in their book if and when these multi year licensing contracts get cancelled.  Imagine a hypothetical scenario where a firm sells a licensing agreement. The customer gives a notice or intent to cancel this licensing agreement at the end of the term or even in the middle of it for whatever reasons.   - there is often penalty involved in early termination  - the notice period is longer often in months  How does this cancellation appear in your quarterly or semi annual reports?  For this potential loss to appear in the official report, you would need this cancellation to be passed to a relevant department and recorded.   How does a customer give a notice to the firm of the intention to cancel the licensing agreement? Through their sales or relationship contact.   Once the sales team receives this cancellation, is there a process that gets initiated or can the sales team decide when to pass this cancellation notice to their management?   This cancellation doesn‚Äôt look good on the sales team that covers that region or customer type. Particularly if the contract amount was large, the bonus would be impacted. The sales team often starts a campaign to minimize the impact of the cancellation or at least understand why the contract is being terminated. These campaigns, due to the nature of the contract, could run months, right up to the date of the actual cancellation. And from what I hear, not very effective use of the sales teams time.   At what point, is the sales team forced to record this cancellation in their book? I think they will delay recording this loss of revenue till the very last day or they try to smooth the loss by booking this loss when there is a significant gain in revenue (new contract for example).   Does the same happen to new customer acquisitions? It could. Maybe preferable to record a new sale in certain months, due to accounting or reporting reasons, or bonus reasons.   For these reasons, technology firms revenue sometimes appears incredibly smooth, smooth because they are cooked, not by management of the firm that might have no knowledge of the book cooking of this nature, but rather on the ground by those who carry out day to day jobs.   This makes me want to spot firms without proper governance to short them. Firms seemingly doing well are the targets. Firms that rely on a few products are the targets instead of large diversified firms.   Eventually I think regulators will step in, but at the moment, they don‚Äôt seem to have much clue around technology licensing businesses.   Maybe this is a tin foil discussion,;,; 2023-12-31 08:59:01]
[First-time Poster (go easy),;,; TLDR: Swapping from Edward Jones to Schwab and looking for traditional IRA and other recommendations. \*Apologies for the following novel!      Hey folks, I am looking for some strategic advice. I started investing three years ago when I finished active-duty military service. My wife and I stupidly didn‚Äôt save or invest any money during my 20 years of service, so no IRAs or TSP starting off. We collectively were living paycheck-to-paycheck during my military service based on terrible spending habits.      In 2021 we sold a house which netted us around $150k. We bought another (at 2.499 interest) but put very little down because we used our VA loan and I wanted to feel the security of having cash on hand. We have kept the rest of the proceeds in the breakdown below. Not really knowing what I was doing, I opened accounts with Edward Jones and started throwing money at it. We were able to open the Roth's based on my income then, but have since become ineligible to add to those due to high income. Also, we bought all of the individual stocks and watched them plummet in 2022, but they have since recovered and we are basically back where we started.      Fast-forward to now, we still spend what I consider a ridiculous amount of money every month, but we are working to correct it and double-down on investing for retirement. I started working with a great company that does a 5% match with John Hancock, and I am maxing that contribution every year (about $20k) with 75% into RFHTX and 25% into the 500 Index Fund. I am not looking to change that allocation unless folks have a compelling recommendation. Additionally, we have roughly $5k/month that is unused (saved) and put in our normal bank savings account which is really giving us no return, about 60 dollars a month, so not really sure what to do there‚Ä¶ I should note that I plan to work for at least the next 15-20 years and expect my current income level to remain static or increase.      So my questions are:     \-	As we are moving into Schwab, what index funds or ETFs would make the most sense for the Roth IRAs?    \-	Should we be maxing out Traditional IRAs with the intent to do a backdoor conversion later?     \-	What should be done with the cash that we have in our bank‚Äôs low-interest savings account?    \-	Are we on track or do I need to make some drastic move like taking savings and paying off vehicles / dropping the savings into my mortgage to reduce it / other?        One thought I have is to make the transition to Schwab and put the Roth‚Äôs/529s into whatever the advisor recommends. Then liquidating the $50,000 in individual stocks from EJ, put that money into a MMF with Schwab and use that money to fund Traditional IRAs for my wife and I. Would this be a smart move?        Below are some of our financial stats:    Age: 44 ‚Äì seeking to retire between 60-65 y.o.    Current take home (net) income: $20,000/mo    \-	$12,000 from employment    \-	$8,000 from military retirement &amp; VA disability    Monthly bills: $10,000/month    Discretionary spending: $5,000/mo    Current 401k: $88,000    (Edward Jones) Existing Roth IRAs: $20,000    USAA Savings account: $90,000    (Edward Jones) Kid‚Äôs 529s: $8,000 (although both kids have GI Bill, so won‚Äôt likely ‚Äúneed‚Äù the 529s)    (Edward Jones) Individual stock positions: $50,000    \-	Alphabet (100 shares)    \-	Amazon (60)    \-	Apple (50)    \-	Blackrock (5)    \-	Duke Energy (10)    \-	Meta (20)    \-	Microsoft (10)    \-	Southwest (100)    \-	Disney (20)    ,;,; 2023-07-29 17:02:26]
[What allocation approach is implied by Toby Nangle's new FT article on narrow markets driving equity returns?,;,; What I take from the article below is not to rely too much on a macro-driven asset allocation strategy.  But what asset allocation strategy makes sense in this environment then?    &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;   www.ft.com /content/c5d7ee71-92a2-4840-9344-2f62e9642e61  # Narrow markets should humble macro forecasters  5-6 minutes   2023-08-08   Toby Nangle    The writer is a former global head of asset allocation at a fund manager   This year has been marked by strong equity markets, and what looks to be an astonishingly narrow rally. Of the 16.9 per cent returned by the S&amp;P 500 index in the first half of this year, 12.9 per cent derived from the performance of only 10 companies.   With such a high proportion of a market‚Äôs value created by so few groups, it feels fair to question the tool kits of asset allocators and, more broadly, the product line-up of fund management firms.   Narrow stock market returns are, after all, the norm. Research by Arizona State University professor Hendrik Bessembinder shows that more than half of the $55.1tn in net wealth generated by the US equity market between 1926 and 2022 came from the performance of fewer than 0.3 per cent of the market‚Äôs stocks, with the other half of this net wealth coming from the next best 3.1 per cent of stocks.   Moreover, almost three-fifths of stocks actually destroyed wealth over the period. In quant-speak, the distribution of compound stock returns has been very positively skewed.   In addition, the skewness of equity returns turns out not to be a particularly North American phenomenon. Indeed, in the three decades ending in December 2020 the proportion of net wealth contributed by the best 1 per cent of emerging market stocks was more than 80 per cent.   Looking at the entire global stock universe outside the US, the proportion rises still further to more than 90 per cent. Winners have won big. Most individual stocks over the past 30 years have failed to outperform dollars stored under the mattress, let alone a local currency interest-bearing cash deposits ‚Äî even after taking into account dividends.   Bessembinder‚Äôs work has typically been surveyed in terms of what it means for active stockpickers ‚Äî with some seeing it as a rationalisation for chasing moonshots and others for pursuing passive index-investing. Less examined has been what it means for asset allocators.   Developed market stock index returns have been dominated by global companies ‚Äî even if they each carry a domestic tilt. As such, connecting local macroeconomic developments to the performance of a region‚Äôs equity index can be something of a dark art.   Single large stocks with an economic fate that has little to do with their listing jurisdiction have dominated national index returns. For example, the photolithography machine-maker ASML accounts for more than a fifth of the total net wealth created by Dutch stocks in the 30 years up to 2020. Global fast-fashion retailer Inditex accounts for more than a sixth of Spanish stock returns. Global luxury brands LVMH and L‚ÄôOr√©al collectively account for almost a quarter of the returns from French stocks. These are not outliers. One cannot explain long-term returns without reference to such companies in pretty much any region.   If it becomes hard to explain equity index returns without reference to specific superstar groups, it stands to reason that it must be even harder to forecast equity index returns without taking a view on some individual companies. It‚Äôs easy today to focus on whether the Magnificent Seven that have powered the S&amp;P 500 rally ‚Äî Apple, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta ‚Äî might stumble. With more than a quarter of the US market‚Äôs valuation riding on them, the question is not at all trivial. But 30 years ago, five of these seven had not even listed. It‚Äôs hard to take a view on companies that don‚Äôt yet exist.   I‚Äôve been as guilty as the next asset allocator in explaining my preference for US over European stocks or vice versa with reference to some domestic macroeconomic outlook. Given that financials, utilities and property groups will carry a strong domestic flavour, this is still forgivable.   But when constructing a long-term strategic asset allocation, it is becoming increasingly untenable to justify regional preferences with reference to local macroeconomic forecasts. This may explain why long-term return forecasts for equity markets ‚Äî or Capital Market Assumptions, as they are known ‚Äî have such a lousy record.   The biggest single investment decision any institutional or individual investor is likely to make in their portfolio is their choice of strategic asset allocation.

[Dell stock research and valuation,;,; # Executive Summary:  Dell has stable long-term prospects. They are a mature company. If they can tame their balance sheet, they would likely significantly increase their share price through returns to shareholders.  Another possibility is that they try to become private again because Michael Dell only took the company public to finance an acquisition. They are currently trading at a significant margin of safety between 11% (no growth) and 44% (10% growth).  # Introduction:  Dell provides businesses with IT solutions, ranging from traditional infrastructure, cloud infrastructure, hardware, and software. They also provide consultant-like solutions such as management and migratory support. They also have consumer-oriented businesses that offer off the shelf and custom to order PC‚Äôs. About half of their revenue is generated in the Americas. They have made a number of large acquisitions, notably EMC (cloud infrastructure/solutions), SecureWorks (IT security), and Virtuestream(Cloud ops). They have operations in 180 countries.  The business is organized into two operating segments, Infrastructure Solutions Group, and Client Solutions Group.  |Group|Client Solutions Group|Infrastructure Solutions Group| |:-|:-|:-| |Common functions|Branded hardware, peripherals, third party software support/deployment/configuration, warranties, customer service, financing, build to order.|Cloud Support, Cloud Services(Cloud Ops), Digital transformation&amp; related services, Multi Cloud integration, Cloud native workload solutions.| |General Description|This includes their PC segment and legacy build to order hardware solutions.¬†Through agreements, they also provide services related to third party software, mostly with integral software on their branded devices.|Offer cloud services, and support businesses adopting cloud services, retain them as customers after, provides reliable recurring revenue.¬†Competes with AWS/Azure Enterprise services as well as infrastructure support providers, oriented towards large enterprise.|  # History:  Dell was founded by Michael Dell in 1984. They produce cell phones, computers, other hardware, and software, but used to do ‚Äúbuild to order‚Äù enterprise infrastructure, which was especially popular in the internet bubble. Its two divisions are Dell client solutions group (CSG), and Dell infrastructure solutions group (EMC). Dell acquired EMC in 2015 for $67 billion, diversifying into the enterprise software and store industry. They bought Alienware in 2006. The company has traditionally been involved in the enterprise hardware business, specifically developing custom infrastructure. They have a focus on high performance PC‚Äôs and custom PC‚Äôs. If anything can be taken from their corporate history, it is that the company is not afraid to take dramatic actions to save its skin.  By the late 2000‚Äôs the company could not turn profits in the ‚Äúmake to order‚Äù business. They decided to shift towards off the shelf consumer and enterprise solutions. They were taken private in 2013 and went public again in 2018. VMWare was owned by EMC, and thus came under the control of Dell. Dell has decided to spin off VMWare, and there is a pending acquisition by Broadcom. The VMWare spinoff was completed in 2021. Michael Dell has been chairman since 1984, and apart from 2004-2007, has been CEO of the company. Kevin Rollins was CEO between 2004-2007, but Michael Dell decided to replace him after 5 quarters of disappointing results.  ## Understanding Dell‚Äôs business segments:  Dell is organized into two segments. They are the Client Solutions Group and the Infrastructure Solutions Group.  ISG brought in $34 billion last year with $3.7 billion operating income. It accounts for 34% of their business. If we assume that this is mostly attributed to the EMC purchase, we can draw conclusions about the rational of the purchase by looking at current operating results. The return on investment is underwhelming but considering that Dell is in a mature stage of growth, it is positive that such a large investment will, at this rate, pay off in less than 20 years. At the current rate, it appears dell is looking at a long-term horizon of 18-20 years where EMC will have to prove its worth. It is hard to tell, but it is likely that Dell only went public for the second time to aid in the EMC acquisition.  |Year|Operating Income|ROI| |:-|:-|:-| |2020|$4.0B|6%| |2021|$3.7B|5.5%| |2022|$3.7B|5.5%|  ISG accounts for $14.7 billion of goodwill, a substantial amount obtained from the EMC purchase. In the MRQ, ISG brought in more operating income than CSG despite its significantly lower revenue, an attestation to the profitability Dell enjoys from the still lucrative enterprise solutions business.  They have been able to gradually increase revenue from servers and networking due to improvements in the configurations and technology available to customers.  In the server vendor industry, Dell is a significant player, second only to HPE in market share held by a single company. They have the largest market share in OEM storage systems. Dependence on cloud in the modern business drives growth in this segment. ISG capitalizes on hybrid cloud integrations, as well as public cloud support through hardware and software directly for CSP‚Äôs. This is a fast growing and profitable industry, and Dell‚Äôs positions as an infrastructure provider creates a barrier to exit for existing clients who integrate their infrastructure with Dell.  CSG brought in the majority of revenue at $61 billion, however it cannot attain the same level of profitability, netting $4.3 billion, still a substantial profit margin. They have $4.2 billion in goodwill. Dell ships the third most PC‚Äôs out of all vendors and has been able to keep their market share steady over the past decade. They are consistently able to raise prices in CSG, however they are subject to upstream price pressures, which would see margins significantly decrease in cool economic environments.  In CSG, there is significant competition among many market participants who are deeply entrenched in the industry. No single company has anything close to a majority. CSG is heavily exposed to international markets, especially Taiwan and China, however they have no supply chain exposure to Russia and Ukraine, and Russian/Ukrainian operations account for less than 1% of revenue.  # Segment industry comparison:  The industry average for PC vendors is an 18% average profit margin, well above the 7% Dell has in CSG, which is indicative of the price it pays for scale. They would have trouble improving this value to industry standards without relinquishing their 16.5% market share for a much smaller share, a clear indication of the competitiveness of this industry.  The industry average for cloud/cloud infrastructure providers is less than two percent. This number is slightly misleading, because seasoned providers like Dell, Azure, HPE, and Amazon are grouped together with Startup cloud companies. Among larger, more seasoned cloud infrastructure providers, average profit margins are closer to 14%. ISG‚Äôs profit margin is 11%.  # Financial performance:  The financial data only goes back to 2015, however we can look at the figures for Dell EMC from which the financial history for ISG can be inferred.  Dell EMC‚Äôs revenue only decreased 5.7% in 2009 but increased by 13.3% in 2010. Their revenue decreased 39% between 2000 and 2002. An implosion similar to the internet bubble would likely produce similar results over the short term, but this should be taken as a floor for shrinkage unless there is some five-sigma event that wreaks havoc in the industry. Profit decreased almost 60% in the same period. If the company has a shaky balance sheet, midterm decreases of 50% can threaten their existence. Given how the company has weathered previous economic downturns and depending on the widespread tech exposure to the economic trends, the company could see losses between 6%-40% in a recession but would not be threatened on the basis of their liquidity in CSG.  Revenue has been exceptional in the past two years. The revenue CAGR is about 12%. Net income was negative before 2019 but has been slightly positive since then.  The company has been teetering around zero equity. As of March second, 2023 (most recent financials), they had liabilities exceeding assets by about $3.03 billion, which is down from minus $1.5 billion the year before. They have a significant cash position of $8.6 billion. Their debt structure is very manageable and spread out over the next 20 years. They have an average of $1 billion a year due except for $4.5 billion due in 2026. 24% of their assets are goodwill, which is not unreasonable for the cash flow it can expect from enterprise clients in the future. If they can control their balance sheet, it would be viable for them to buy back shares. Michael Dell does not like relinquishing control of his company, so this may become reality in the future and he could take the company private.  The quarterly and annual results for 2022 indicate there are hard times to come. They averaged a 2.4% profit margin. Operating cash flows decreased over 60% YoY. Despite this, there has been solid growth in operating cash flows in the past decade due to favorable business conditions, and real growth in a mature client base. The operating cash flows will return when economic conditions ease. Capex has increased with opex, which is mostly attributable to the ISG segment maintenance and expansion.  # Valuation:  In projecting the FCF, we should have two sections, one for the next three years resembling the most recent downturn in financial results, and then for the remainder, returning to more normal financial conditions. We will go with a long-term growth rate equal to their growth in a zero rate environment (12.25%) minus the long term target rate of 2%, discounted by the company cost of capital (10%) plus a long term average risk free rate of 5%. Time horizon of 10 years. With this DCF, we arrive at an **intrinsic value of $38.89 billion**. They have a strong ability to generate cash, and do not have prohibitively high capex. Even with no growth, as long as they can hold their cash flows and keep interest and capex down, they would still be valued at $30 billion. However, there could be significant impairments on the company‚Äôs ability to generate cash and raise debt if they cannot get their balance sheet under control.,;,; 2023-03-13 01:34:24]

I don‚Äôt need the money right now, but I still perceive a lot of risk in continue to hold that many stocks from 1 single company.  What is the general sentiment around AMZN stock at the moment? Is everybody on a similar boat, holding the bag in hopes it comes back up? Or have you lowered your expectations already and not expect it to go back to high $150s level ever again?

[NVDA may surpass AMZN within weeks,;,; Wild times guys. To summarize, NVDA reported super bullish guidance for coming quarters, average yearly estimate was $30B in revenue, which may now be somewhere between $40B-$50B. We will be seeing lot of upgrades from analysts in coming days. I am still puzzled as to how this was already not priced on with almost 100% run in last 6 months alone. Now stock is up another 26%.  Amazon will be doing ~$550B in revenue in 2023 alone with low teen growth next year. And their market cap is between $1T-$1.1T.  Can someone help me understand how NVDA has such a low short interest at these level? And literally everyone thinks this all makes sense? (Excluding redditors) i am talking about institutional investors, because at these level, they are the one moving the needle. And they clearly loading this up big time. At least for TSLA when it went on this insane run, there was lot of short interest, then S&amp;P 500 inclusion hype, stock split, EV demand surge and 0% interest rate.   Trying to figure out what these fund managers are seeing for bull case for NVDA.,;,; 2023-05-25 02:37:44]
[AMZN‚Äôs IRBT Acquisition Blocked,;,; https://www.wsj.com/tech/eu-commission-intends-to-block-amazons-irobot-acquisition-268a8a1b?st=bjnwur0cdx40b09&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share   I got into IRBT because it seemed that if Microsoft was allowed to acquire Activision, AMZN should be able to acquire a vacuume company, no issue, right? Right?   It seemed like the risk to reward was there but I think the moral of the story is: don‚Äôt buy garbage companies and expect them to fly up. I have played various other merger plays with good success but this one went against my idea of buying decent companies. **Without the merger, IRBT is still overvalued at current prices.**  If you are still in this, the risks of blockage are higher than I expected because AMZN isn‚Äôt willing to play ball. Also, considering AMZN dropped the acquisition price previously, it is possible they will drop it again due to the massive drop in price recently. Good luck to anyone who is still playing this.   All and all, lost a good chunk of money, sold, and I‚Äôve learned my lesson: **if you aren‚Äôt willing to hold the underlying, don‚Äôt buy it just solely for the merger.**,;,; 2024-01-19 15:17:07]

This is according to a report out from CNBC, which comes after he already shelled up just about $240 million worth of the stock last week. Now, Bezos still owns 988 million Amazon shares.

[Does $HIMS have a chance against $AMZN ???,;,;  I am now convinced [$HIMS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMS&amp;src=cashtag_click) is so undervalued due to [$AMZN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&amp;src=cashtag_click) launching Amazon Clinic last month nationwide in the US. I have done some research on the competitive landscape Hims is up against!   1) Amazon Healthcare offers ‚Äúmultiple telehealth provider groups‚Äù who each set their own rates for service. The company says those visits will cost an average of $75. And $35 for a messaging session. (No insurance is accepted). I went through the sign up process for this, and it was similar to making an Amazon purchase - simple and quick. It's definitely a large competitive threat. But the platform is cut and dry and doesn't offer the educational material or specialized treatments that [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&amp;src=cashtag_click) does. Additionally the brand may not "feel" trustworthy to some with their personal health information either, IMO. Amazon has work to do on their branding power in this space. Nonetheless, I have no doubt they will be a leader in the space.    2) Teledoc - works with all major insurance carriers. The website seems a decade or 2 old for the sign up process. [$TDOC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TDOC&amp;src=cashtag_click) is a "stayer" in the space for the foreseeable future due to being grandfathered in with the insurance companies and regulators. The management has taken some large missteps recently in overpaying in purchasing other companies. I dont see them as a long term threat to [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&amp;src=cashtag_click) because their innovation is lacking, and management does not seem like a bootstrapping company like [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&amp;src=cashtag_click). Not to mention, their branding is B2B, so I get the impression they are not investing in their image/branding, which could hurt them later.    3) [$HIMS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMS&amp;src=cashtag_click) has a major advantage in this space of being one of the only major founder led companies that is a fearless innovator. While being a company focused only on healthcare, dominating multiple segments in a short period, and starting to branch out into multiple segments. Further, the B2C branding, I believe, will help them win in the long run as they build trust with the public. I believe any telehealth company should invest in building this trust the same way your local hospital builds trust with their local community.    Conclusion- [$AMZN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&amp;src=cashtag_click) is their largest competitive threat, IMO, but as [$NFLX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24NFLX&amp;src=cashtag_click) has been able to survive/thrive in the streaming space against Amazon, I don't see any reason Hims can't do the same. I believe Hims is an exciting shopping experience where you can get expert information and personalized products at a great price. A great thing about [$HIMS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMS&amp;src=cashtag_click) as well is the no judgment experience, discreet packaging, and the trustworthy reputation they're building when dealing with HIPPA. [$AMZN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&amp;src=cashtag_click)'s threat is convenience, price, deep pockets, and efficiency. However, when it comes to health, I think people will want the personalized service. It is not the same as ordering dog food and toilet paper online. One downside I've seen as well is that Amazon is basing part of their clinic business on collecting your data. I believe there will be a decent percentage of people who will not trust "big evil" Amazon with their personal health data. It is difficult to do a really good competitive analysis because some of this is still speculation since [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&amp;src=cashtag_click) and [$amzn](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24amzn&amp;src=cashtag_click) are so new in the space. A lot of segments are yet to be penetrated, and neither are able to accept insurance yet. I believe these 2 will end up taking most of the space while [$tdoc](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24tdoc&amp;src=cashtag_click) gets left behind. ,;,; 2023-10-10 23:17:54]

[Amazon is facing a major Antitrust Lawsuit from the FTC, which would reshape $AMZN's core operations,;,; Amazon is facing a major Antitrust Lawsuit from the FTC, which would reshape $AMZN's core operations.        This lawsuit is seen as 'the big one,' with FTC Chair Lina Khan leading the charge. Lina Khan is known for her hardline stance against Amazon, and may push for a radical restructuring of Amazon's business model. The Federal Trade Commission is alleging that the company is using its market power to stifle competition and harm consumers.        If the FTC is successful in its lawsuit, it could force Amazon to change its business practices and make it easier for third-party sellers to compete on the marketplace. The lawsuit could also have a broader impact on the tech industry, as it could signal a more aggressive approach to antitrust enforcement by the FTC.        The lawsuit, which is expected to be filed in the coming weeks, will focus on Amazon's core online marketplace. The FTC is alleging that Amazon is using its control over the marketplace to favor its own products and services, and to disadvantage third-party sellers who do not use Amazon's fulfillment services.,;,; 2023-06-30 18:54:31]
[TUP Recap, Watchlist: AMZN, OIL, EV, WMT,;,; TLDR:  Short Amazon  Buy WMT  Buy Oil/Oil derived products  Buy EV  Hello all, I was beating the drum on TUP since $1.33. Looks like we had a nice little pop. I have liquidated almost all of my holdings in TUP. Currently holding 25 shares at $2.00. I have 1 put at $2 as well. I like to buy put options close to or ATM w/ long positions in stock. Nice little hedge to protect you from any downside.  My next speculative call is LCID. As of July 14. There are 2.27B shares Outs. Float of 406,097,447. Short Interest 167,766,715, roughly 41%. I do not necessarily see this as a squeeze yet. However, Bank of America just announced  that $90/ barrel is imminent. The oil supply in the US has drastically been declining. This will lead to higher prices for anything utilizing oil (Plastic, Gas, Polyurethane, Solvents, ETC.) This usually leads to people searching for cheaper alternatives.  Which is why LCID (EV in general) and anything pertaining to oil is on my watchlist. I wouldn't be surprised to see a dip and rip with anything oil.    WMT, I have been watching for quite some time now (over a year). I have a fairly large position in Walmart (over 100)  at strikes from $165-$220, about 90% expiring Dec.. Walmart started in January 2022 developing their own crypto coin. The CTO of Walmart, in October of 22' said he expects crypto to be a major payment disruptor and a very important payment tool to use. In June of 2023, they opened their second automation facility. If that isn't enough, Walmart is a major contributor in the AI industry. They have embedded AI all over their facilities and have been buying AI IP. The  FTC is also looking into Amazons rigged search results and how they advertise for business owners. Sounds like they are forcing businesses to pay more for a higher product ranking. This is among a slew of other antitrust violations. amazon could be a great short with Walmart gaining market share. If the FTC follows through on their Amazon lawsuit and they succeed at breaking up amazon. It stands to reason that Walmart will gain the majority of Amazons market share.  https://corporate.walmart.com/IRL/](https://corporate.walmart.com/IRL/  https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2023/06/15/walmart-opens-high-tech-fulfillment-center-near-indianapolis](https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2023/06/15/walmart-opens-high-tech-fulfillment-center-near-indianapolis)   This is speculation and not financial advice.

[Powerhouse Picks: META, AMZN, or NFLX - Unveiling the most compelling FAANG stock,;,;    # Meta Platforms ($META)  Shares of social media giant Meta Platforms have rallied by a phenomenal 107% year-to-date. The company impressed investors by returning back to revenue growth in the first quarter (after three straight quarters of decline) despite subdued digital ad spending due to macro pressures.  Investors have also cheered the company‚Äôs aggressive cost-cutting and streamlining efforts, including thousands of layoffs. Despite the distraction caused by regulatory matters, most Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about Meta‚Äôs prospects.  Meta‚Äôs user base continues to expand, with daily active people (number of users who visited at least one of the family apps ‚ÄìFacebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp in a day) growing 5% year-over-year to 3.02 billion (on average) in March. The company expects capital expenditure of $30 billion to $33 billion this year toward the build-out of its artificial intelligence (AI) capacity to support ads, Feed, and Reels as well as increased investment in generative AI initiatives.  **Is Meta a Good Stock to Buy?**  On Tuesday, Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion reiterated a Buy rating on Meta Platforms stock with a price target of $270 after taking a deep look at the company‚Äôs AI capabilities.The analyst sees the company leveraging AI to boost user engagement, develop better and more automated advertiser tools, and create an open-source AI ecosystem. Champion is also optimistic about Meta‚Äôs positioning within the digital ads space.  ## Amazon ($AMZN)  Like Meta, Amazon is also reducing its costs to navigate a tough business backdrop. The company‚Äôs retail business has been under pressure due to the impact of macro challenges on consumer spending. Additionally, the slowdown in the growth rate of the higher-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has also been concerning. Enterprises are moderating their IT budgets, which is weighing on AWS‚Äôs growth.  Wall Street continues to be bullish on Amazon and sees solid potential in the retail and AWS divisions over the long term. Moreover, AMZN‚Äôs rapidly growing advertising business is also expected to boost revenue in the years ahead. Despite macro pressures, Amazon‚Äôs ad revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $9.5 billion in Q1.  **Is AMZN a Buy, Sell, or Hold?**  Earlier this week, Mizuho analyst James Lee increased his price target for Amazon to $160 from $145 and reiterated a Buy rating, calling the stock his top pick for the second half of 2023. The analyst expects multiple expansion as concerns about the company‚Äôs AI market position ‚Äúdiminish.‚Äù  Recent channel checks by Lee‚Äôs firm with a leading channel partner indicated that AWS‚Äôs generative AI demand has been accelerating due to the ease of transition and product differentiation.  ‚ÄúCase studies show that AWS wins over clients on intelligence privacy and data security,‚Äù said Lee. Further, he also highlighted that generative AI is priced meaningfully higher than conventional computing, so it is expected to be both revenue and margin accretive to AWS. Consequently, Lee believes AWS revenue growth will likely trough in Q2 before rebounding in the second half of the year.  ## Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)  Netflix‚Äôs crackdown on password sharing has improved investor sentiment about the streaming giant. Password sharing has been a key concern for Netflix, especially as competition has become intense in the streaming space. Netflix had previously estimated that over 100 million households share accounts, representing 43% of its global user base. This week, Netflix rolled out its password-sharing crackdown to its home market.  Aside from the password-sharing crackdown, Netflix‚Äôs business is expected to improve through its recent introduction of a cheaper, ad-supported tier.  **What is the Price Target for Netflix?**  On Thursday, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein increased the price target for Netflix stock to $450 from $415 and maintained a Buy rating in reaction to the launch of paid sharing offering at $7.99 per additional household stream.  Prior to the announcement, the analyst‚Äôs firm conducted a survey of 1,800 U.S. Netflix consumers. The survey indicated a healthy propensity to pay for ‚Äúremote‚Äù users, with certain abandoned users willing to pay for their own subscriptions.  While 45% of respondents indicated a willingness to pay for ‚Äúremote‚Äù users, 70% indicated an inclination for the $6.99 ad-tier plan. With pricing of the paid sharing option above the ad-tier, the survey suggests a significant portion of these users will be pushed toward the ad-based offer.  # Conclusion  Wall Street is more bullish on Meta Platforms and Amazon compared to Netflix. Given the massive rally in Meta stock, Wall Street sees higher upside potential in Amazon stock from current levels. Analysts mainly see solid potential in Amazon‚Äôs AWS cloud business, supported by solid demand for cloud computing and prospects for growth in the AI space.,;,; 2023-05-29 11:19:17]

[Without Amazon ($AMZN), this is what S&amp;P 500 earnings would look like.,;,;  First-quarter earnings season is in full swing right now, with none bigger than last week's **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**) numbers, which topped analyst estimates. The company is now responsible for a huge portion of the S&amp;P 500's earnings performance.   E-commerce giant Amazon is the largest contributor to earnings growth for the entire S&amp;P 500 for the first quarter and 2023, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet Research Systems.  If Amazon were excluded, Butters says, the blended earning decline (reported plus expected results) for the S&amp;P 500 in Q1 would grow to -5.1% from -3.7%. And the estimated earnings growth rate for the entire S&amp;P 500 this year would fall to 0.2% from 1.2%.  FactSet says that from a macro perspective, "At the midpoint of the Q1 2023 earnings season, S&amp;P 500 companies are recording their best performance relative to analyst expectations since Q4 2021. Both the number of companies reporting positive EPS surprises and the magnitude of these earnings surprises are above their 10-year averages."  Amazon.com also is the largest contributor to earnings growth for the Consumer Discretionary sector. Excluding the company, the estimated 2023 earnings growth for the sector falls to 10.1% from 27.2%.      ## Amazon Earnings  On April 27, Amazon **reported strong first-quarter earnings and sales results** that topped Wall Street targets. Amazon earned 31 cents per share, up from the year-ago period's 38-cent loss. Meanwhile, revenue climbed 9% to $127.35 billion.  However, management said Amazon Web Services is seeing slower growth in April vs. Q1. First-quarter sales for the cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, rose 16% to $21.4 billion, slowing from 37% growth in the year-earlier period. Analysts had projected AWS growth of 15% for the March quarter.  That spooked investors ‚Äî $AMZN stock dropped 4% in response ‚Äî because Wall Street analysts have expected **AWS revenue growth to trough** in the June quarter of 2023, then slowly reaccelerate. However, if the U.S. economy falls into a recession, the AWS slowdown could hit bottom later.  Looking forward, Amazon's 2023 earnings are expected to swing to a $1.56 per-share profit from 2022's 27-cent loss. Annual earnings are expected to jump 65% in 2024.     ## $AMZN Stock Builds New Base  Amazon stock continues to consolidate in a **cup-with-handle base** that has a 110.96 **buy point**. $AMZN stock is about 7% away from that entry, as it rallied 1% Wednesday. A key flaw is that the stock spent the entirety of the base below the **long-term 200-day moving average**.  Keep in mind that Amazon is a longtime laggard, with a weak **relative strength line**. Plus, shares remain about 30% off their 52-week high, so there is plenty of **overheard supply** that could hinder the stock's rebound.

The transformation usually takes the shape of improved supply chain discipline as well as streamlining business operations in order to achieve better operating margins.  For the oil and¬†[natural gas](https://oilprice.com/admin/articles/Energy/Natural-Gas/Natural-Gas-A-Comprehensive-Guide-To-The-Worlds-Most-Crucial-Fuel.html)¬†industry, the moment of truth arrived a few years ago after years of weak benchmark prices, shrinking margins and massive capital flight forced the sector to seriously rethink the way it does business with energy companies increasingly turning toward tech heavyweights for help in cutting costs and streamlining operations.¬†  A good case in point is¬†[a partnership](https://www.hartenergy.com/news/halliburton-teams-advance-digital-capabilities-microsoft-accenture-188653)¬†struck between¬†**Haliburton Co.**¬†(NYSE:HAL),¬†**Microsoft Inc.**¬†(NASDAQ:MSFT) and¬†**Accenture Plc.**¬†(NYSE:ACN) in 2020. For years, Haliburton, one of the world‚Äôs largest oilfield services companies, has been plagued by shrinking margins and chronic underperformance. The company eventually made a deal with the two cloud giants to migrate its existing data centers to cloud and enhance digital offerings.   Halliburton is hardly alone.  After years of dilly-dallying, oil and gas companies are now rapidly moving their IT infrastructure out to the Cloud as well as adopting Business Process Management (BPM) systems. This frequently results in a leaner, more agile organizational model whilst delivering significant cost savings.  Barclays estimates that the upstream market digital services industry will grow from less than $5 billion in 2020 to a more than $30 billion annual tab by 2025, thus enabling $150 billion in annual savings for oil producers. Opportunities for cost savings include cutting capital expenditures (capex) as well as selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) costs and transportation operating costs.  According to Barclays, the digital age is finally dawning for the energy sector with the market poised to erupt over the next five years. Over the past few years, Microsoft has struck cloud partnerships with several Big Oil companies including¬†**ExxonMobil**¬†(NYSE:XOM),¬†**Chevron Inc**. (NYSE:CVX) and Haliburton while Google‚Äôs parent company¬†**Alphabet Inc.**¬†(NASDAQ:GOOG)[¬†has significantly expanded](https://www.slb.com/newsroom/press-release/2019/pr-2019-0513-slb-google-cloud)¬†its partnership with¬†**Schlumberger Ltd.**¬†(NYSE:SLB), another oilfield services giant.

[Got Apple at $38, should I unload some of it?,;,; I got[555 shares](https://imgur.com/a/K25po4X), its about 25% of my retirement portfolio. Its in my ROTH account, so I won't have to pay any taxes. The rest of my retirement portfolio is a mix of (SPY, QQQ, MSFT, AMZN, DIS, IWM, ORCL, UBER, TWLO, XLE, ADBE).   I feel like I'm a bit too overweight with AAPL, and IF their stock goes down, due to their slower growth trajectory, my cheeks would get clapped a bit.

["Magnificent 7" vs S&amp;P 500?,;,; I really don't like the *"Magnificent 7"* name at all, but since everyone has adopted it, let's just roll with it. For those who don't know the Magnificent 7 are: **AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META, TSLA, NVDA.** With a combined market cap of **more than $11 trillion**, they currently make up approx. **29% of the S&amp;P 500's market cap.**   The 7 giants have gained **71%** so far this year while the rest of the 493 stocks included in the benchmark index have gained 6%. They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets.   Most analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least.   Now I know this is a "stocks" subreddit but just like the majority of retail investors, a large chunk of my portfolio is alocated to an S&amp;P 500 ETF.  So I am actually considering instead of DCAing into a broad index ETF, why don't I just DCA into those 7? Maybe even swap META &amp; TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE.  Should we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world? Should we consider cyclicality? There's no doubt that all 7 of these companies are leaders and are probably not going anywhere in the near future. Nowdays it's as difficult as ever to overtake these giants, imo.,;,; 2023-11-16 10:38:24]
[Thought Experiment - If you were forced to invest into a stock based on a metric (and the stock price was hidden) what metric would it be?,;,; I was thinking to myself - if the news channels and investing platforms wouldn't show the stock price but some other fundamental metric then what would you prefer it be? If this were to be the case, it would    	1. help us invest more soundly on a fundamental basis ;    	2. avoid people "fomoing" into a stock when it has run up and,    	3. also help us to avoid selling when the stock price has fallen - as seeing the fundamental metric instead of the stock price would provide us with a better info - or even the calrity to buy the stock as its now available cheaper.         For eg: For AMZN P/OCF is touted as a better measure to keep track of for investing into AMZN. If below 20/22 then it's touted as a good buying opportunity and not a good opportunity if its above that.         What would your preferred metric be? I understand its not possible to have a one-size-fits-all metric but as it's a thought experiment, we are not limited - we can even have multiple metrics but the key is the stock price is hidden. ,;,; 2023-09-26 16:59:07]

[43 years old and I just invested in stocks for the first time in my life,;,; Hi everyone!  I decided to post here because I'm anxious, scared, and excited at the same time because I finally saved up some money and invested it for the first time.  I quit drinking beer and buying useless crap, and saved up (don't laugh) $1,000 dollars and had it sitting there in a credit union with pennies for interest and I didn't like that.    I'm really kicking myself for not doing this when I was younger.  I remember when I was in my mid 20's "this close" to making a brokerage account and getting started, and I never did it.  Did this scare any of you the first time you got in to trading?    The first share I bought was 1 full share in the Vanguard VGT ETF.  I know it sounds dumb, but it was pretty scary and exciting at the same time.  My position is focusing 80% ETFs and sprinkle in some individual stocks to play around with.    My primary goal is dividends and compound reinvesting, in the hopes that I can have a nice-ish passive income 20-30 years from now.  I'm wondering what you guys think of my current positions:  **ETFs:** VGT, VONG, VTI, SCHD, and SCHG  **Stocks** *(I bought fractions of these)*:  AAPL, AMZN, HD, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, O, RTX, WM, WMT  That was my attempt of diversifying.  I have been reading until my eyes bleed, and I really have no idea if what I'm doing is considered smart or not.  But for the first time, checking my portfolio today.. seeing I'm up 1.24% with everything in green (short of stupid Wal\*Mart)...    I'm up a whopping $10!  And I think that's pretty cool!!!

Tesla focuses on being the best at what they do and currently has the best assembly line process. Other car companies are trying to copy Tesla. Eventually, all other services will come to fruition, i.e. FSD, Robotaxis, Robots.  As a side note, Elon mentioned in public that he thought Tesla was a 3 to 4 trillion dollar company.

[Thoughts on this Strategy: Zombie-Free Indexing,;,; We all know indexing has many advantages. If you aren‚Äôt aware simply google them. One of the main drawbacks is you tend to get the good the bad and the ugly. It drives me nuts knowing my index funds hold/held zombie companies like JCPenny, Macy‚Äôs, GM, airlines, etc when many of these businesses are obviously not good or have tough futures. They exist, but they ain‚Äôt thriving or haven‚Äôt thrived in years.  So I thought, what if i had a basic way to screen out the zombie companies. For me there are a few elements of all businesses that are basically universally good:  Sales are growing, shareholders aren‚Äôt diluted, debt is low, there are healthy gross margins and valuation is reasonable. I use these elements are to develop a ranking system. That‚Äôs it. They can have no or plenty of operating profit, net profit, ROEs, and so on.  Many factor based strategies look for the metrics included above but I feel that is not a great idea. In my view, there are just too many counter examples to focus on ‚Äúfactors‚Äù to make them reliable (AMZN, TSLA, CRM, NOW, etc). Hell a dividend can be interpreted as a sign the company doesn‚Äôt have good investment opportunities. And no operating profits (in the case of AMZN/CRM) were the results of aggressive investments in dominating businesses.  I took this theory and ran it in portfolio123 which has controls for backtesting biases and anecdotally looked into a few companies:  A company like Macy‚Äôs never qualified in the past 20 years.  NVDA first made the cut in 2015 when it was at $5 or $6 (split adjusted)  Kohl‚Äôs never made the cut.  Disney would have made it and been kicked out, PayPal still showing great fundamentals despite it‚Äôs getting obliterated.  I'd love to hear your thoughts and engage in a discussion about this investment strategy. Do you think focusing on the metrics above would lead to a better portfolio in the real world?  Thank you for reading, and I look forward to your insights!,;,; 2023-12-03 02:36:29]
[What percentages of your portfolio are allocated in Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft?,;,; I believe that these companies are too significant to face failure, and their growth will persist in both the short and long term. Additionally, they will gradually acquire additional market share, even venturing into industries such as automotive, as seen with Apple and Google. They will eagerly invest in promising startups, employing any means necessary to eliminate competition and establish dominance. With abundant financial resources and exceptional intellect, they possess the ability to expand continuously. And they will be overvalued too if not already.  Yet I'm slowly moving my portfolio to have more and more these stocks. I'm curious what percentages of your portfolio are allocated in AMZN, AAPL, GOOG and MSFT?  Ignore the portions in your ETFs.

In retrospect, those stocks were super easy and obvious to pick.   Everyone knew they were on their way to dominating and it was clear you could invest, sleep well at night with almost no risk as long has you had a 5-10 year time horizon.   I did this with small amounts of money that turned into solid positions, but I don't think they have the same growth ahead to 5-15x over the next 10 years the way they did the last 10.

[What are the fundamental traits of promising companies?,;,; I am looking to build a screener that looks at some universal truths of promising companies. Something that when higher/lower it is basically always good. In this post I will argue for the inclusion of some traits and the avoidance of some common ones. Please see below:  What makes a promising company?  *Sales, Operating Cash Flow, Free Cash Flow Growth*: if you ain‚Äôt growing your dieing.  *High Gross Margins*: indication of significant value add  *Low Debt and Interest Coverage*: this is where risk of a company is. The lower the better, particularly if they are doing well in all the other factors.  *Low Shareholder Dilution*: like debt, if they are doing the other things well but give the company away, that‚Äôs no good.  Characteristics I‚Äôd argue against:  *Net Income margin, Operating Income Margin, ROE*: as you get farther down the income statement, more and more can be played with by management. Take AMZN for example. Look at this [chart](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-revenue-vs-profit-2016-1). AMZN had torrid growth and never grew earnings. Why did the stock go up even though it was and still kinda is a non-profit? They were reinvesting aggressively to fuel that growth ultimately growing their future cash flows more than they otherwise would have been if they showed a profit. Also by not having profits, you minimize taxes. AMZN isn‚Äôt the only one to do this, Salesforce did the same [thing](https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2018/1/19/saupload_b70533bae99138dbebd44adae05789c8.png).  It‚Äôs not that I think NI, OI and ROE are bad, I am looking for promising companies that are before their maturity.  With ROE, that tells you where a company is, not where it‚Äôs going. Take Colgate, they have an ROE of 500%! Do we think that each incremental investment they make will yield a 500% ROE? of course not. They have been able to replace equity with debt to make the ‚ÄúE‚Äù smaller jacking up the ROE.  NI Margin is getting more manipulated with GAAP changes. For example, pass through gain and losses on security investments flow through the income statement. Berkshire is a classic case here.  OI Margin: As mentioned above, companies can purposefully spend more to boost growth and if you have say 60, 70, 80% gross margins, that seems like a great idea. This will mean no profits today, faster growth today, and hopefully a greater ability to harvest profits later.  *What do you think, are there any other universal truths of promising companies?*  Thank you for your insights!,;,; 2023-12-04 00:36:00]
[Portfolio setup,;,; Backstory. I‚Äôm currently invested in about 20 stocks of about 5% each. Mostly a dividend portfolio with positions in mostly what I feel are ‚Äúvalue‚Äù dividend stocks.

[Buffett - choose 3 business for the next 10 years,;,; I was listening to a Buffett interview from 1996. A lot of you may have listened to it as well. He was asked a question about diversification and in classic Buffett fashion, he rejected the whole ideology behind diversification and university finance courses teaching the prudent principle of diversification. Personally I agree with him, and he has stuck to this principle for a long time. Berkshire has a 50% allocation to apple right now. He said you should never need more than 3 businesses to make you extremely wealthy and get you through all economic conditions.   I‚Äôm interested in hearing.

[How was eBay unable to keep up with Amazon?,;,; Arguably the two earliest starters in e-commerce to survive the tech bubble bursting, both Amazon (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY) positioned themselves well enough to thrive in Web 2.0. However, while Amazon today has become a behemoth ($1 trillion market cap and controlling an undisputed majority of online retail), eBay just kind of stagnated ($23.6 billion market cap, only about 10-15% of online retail despite being in second place to Amazon).  To be fair to eBay, nobody was going to match Amazon‚Äôs ambitions of expansion and world domination. That said, what was once a competitive rival for Amazon is now more of an afterthought than a challenger.

[What's your largest individual stock holding? (No shilling, please).,;,; Howdy everybody. Lately, I've been investing more in individual stocks that are undervalued, as opposed to putting it in ETF's that are at ATH. Thus far, my strategy has outperformed the overall market by quite a bit. I'm up 20% since starting this strategy about 6 months ago, versus the overall market being up by about 10% in the same time period. Yes, I understand there's inherently more risk with individual stocks. Also, FWIW, I'm not bragging, just giving some depth to the conversation and my reasoning for asking these questions. Anyway, moving on. I'm looking to expand that number of individual stock holdings, but also diversity into new holdings as opposed to taking bigger positions on what I already own. Im looking for crowd favorites for individual stock holdings. So my question to you all is this: For those who don't have *all* of their money in ETF's, what is the single stock you hold the most of? How much of that holding represents your overall portfolio? Are these long-term holdings, or have you purchased shares lately? Why is that particular stock your largest individual holding?   I'll leave mine out for the time being because I don't want this to come across as a shilling post or for it to devolve into an argument. I genuinely want to know what you guys are holding. So, how about it, people? What are you holding?,;,; 2023-12-20 07:28:01]

Specifically, I'm caught between rebalancing my current tech-heavy portfolio, adding AAPL to the mix, or just simplifying life by moving everything into QQQ.   This particular portfolio makes up around 30% of my total retirement savings, and I plan to start drawing it down slowly in about 2 years.        My Current Portfolio      MSFT: \~75%    AMZN: \~9%    NVDA: \~8%    TSLA: \~6%    GOOG: \~1%    Some Context:    I earned my MSFT shares during my career there and am pretty bullish on their future, hence the big slice of the pie they occupy. I added the TSLA in 2016 and sold a few when it had a big gain but again I'm bullish on them. Most of the stocks have been held for at least 3 years.        So, what are your thoughts?        Should I rebalance these existing stocks?    Should I consider adding AAPL to diversify a bit within the tech sector?    Or should I just move it all into QQQ for ease of management?      Just seeking opinions.  &amp;#x200B;  If I don't simplify now I will need to in the coming years. I have a couple of years of cash equivalents available and will rebalance annually.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm not keen to just put it all in in an S&amp;P tracker or whatever as I believe tech will out perform for the foreseeable future. Also much of the rest of my retirement fund is well diversified in managed funds I can't touch yet due to tax/age.        Cheers!        ,;,; 2023-09-11 13:37:17]
[Curious of what others are struggling with in the markets,;,; I've found that rationally investing for the long term is becoming more challenging over time. Online brokerages and apps with no fees have drawn  massive liquidity to the markets. It's harder for me to analyze good companies, it's harder to get relevant information, and it's harder to wade through the hyperbole trendy news to understand legitimate industry trends, and the softwares that are out there (like Bloomberg terminal) help but is absolutely unaffordable to the individual investors.

[5 Traits of Companies that have Outperformed,;,; 1. Lower Debt Levels  The world is uncertain and when things go against you, debt magnifies the negative. Of course it can magnify good things as well, but the data reviewed suggests that the best performers get their without high levels of debt.  2. Higher Growth on a Per Share Basis  In things like sales, operating cash flow and free cash flows. The per share component is critical because growth at all costs (especially diluting shareholders) hurts performance  3. Higher Gross Margins  High gross margins suggest that the company can create something of significant value in excess of competition. For a product company, the inputs to make say a cell phone are all more or less the same, being able to sell far in excess of those same ingredients is an indication of pricing power.  4. Operate in a Capital Efficient Manner  This helps to ensure low dilution and low debt hold over time. To model this I used Gross Profits / Operating Assets. Operating assets are defined as Total Assets - market investments.   5. Sell at a reasonable Price  Even if you meet the criteria of the other 4 to a high degree, the company is not worth an infinite price. I ranked companies by their Gross Profits / Market Cap.   I then plugged this information into Portfolio123. This is back testing software that makes adjustments for when financial data was released (in other words no look ahead bias). I then ranked companies that are part of the Russell 1000 into 10 groups. Higher ranked companies meet more of the criteria mentioned and lesser ranked companies do not meet the conditions mentioned.  The results: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10UJ3-oVJVzDbh4Xclsfdrs9fbPk-TvM6u1nrK6dBxF4/edit  Other Notes: All data above looks at past financial data that would have been available at the time.  Why the focus on Gross vs Net Profits? As mentioned, in my view Gross profits may indicate pricing power. Also when dealing with financials in bulk as you move down the income statement the data can get more noisy. For example in the last few years, gains and losses are required to -ass through the income statement even though it doesn‚Äôt make economic sense (you can look up the values of these securities on the balance sheet). Also I realized companies make trade offs farther down the income statement that are neither good nor bad but could be screened out if we only looked at operating or net profits. For example for 2 decades AMZN and CRM purposefully invested aggressively and never showed gains in profits despite a torrid growth pace. This was ultimately wise as they gobbled up more market share. Only recently (particularly for CRM) have profits started as revenue growth has slowed and les investment is needed.   I hope you found this useful!,;,; 2024-01-01 19:00:52]

[Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..),;,; From https://www.investors.com/news/nasdaq-100-plans-special-rebalance-to-curb-dominance-of-magnificent-seven/    The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the "magnificent seven" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.  The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.  The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to "address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights."  The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.  The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.   How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted? The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.  The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.  The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.  Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.  Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.  Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.  Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.  Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.  How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut? Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.  Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.  The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.  Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023 The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.  This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.  There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.  Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices? The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.  However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&amp;P 500, which is why S&amp;P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.  The S&amp;P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.  Most of the "magnificent 7" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.  The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.  Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.,;,; 2023-07-10 20:25:37]
[Large cap stocks vs. Index funds,;,; Hey all,  Have more of a general question - I recently opened up positions in a few large cap stocks (AMZN, META, PEP to be specific) with plans to hold these for the foreseeable future.  Long term holds that I don't plan on looking at or touching too often.  The question I have is - what is the reason do to do this rather than just put it all in some index fund like VTI?  Am I better off just throwing all of these funds in an index fund like that? Realistically the chances of these stocks beating the overall market seem to be slim. Pardon my ignorance if this is an obvious question!     For transperancy, I was planning on putting \~70% of my funds into index funds (VTI and SCHD) anyway, and using the other 30% for specific stocks.  Is it better to just put 100% into ETFs?,;,; 2023-05-23 16:29:59]

[Deciding REITS for my portfolio. But lack the confidence in knowing how to valuate each choice.,;,; Obviously I want the best to profit the most and don't want to waste time trying learn through experience unless I have the tools to do it efficiently.  I am trying to be a combination of investing types or styles. First is Core and Satellite Investing,  GARP Investing, and Passive Aggressive Investing.  My Portfolio so far is QQQM, AMZN, AAPL, and GLD.  The list of REITS I am trying to decide on adding to the portfolio is this  They all provide monthly dividends because of my preference.  * Realty Income Corporation (O) (I know O is popular choice with its consistent growing dividends) * Stag Industrial, Inc. (STAG) * EPR Properties (EPR) * LTC Properties, Inc. (LTC) * Global Net Lease, Inc. (GNL) * Gladstone Commercial Corporation (GOOD)  I have some google sheets made by someone online that I bought for cheap to find good stocks by different stock model valuations. But the person has a reit valuation model and a stock valuation model.  This makes me uncertain since I would want it to be O but I don't want to be bias because of the hype of a single stock.  From my REIT model GNL and GOOD are considered a buy. while the rest at the moment are considered a sell.  But compared to stock valuation O, STAG, EPR, and LTC are considered a buy  This leaves me uncertain is GNL and GOOD considered undervalued? or are both valuation models ineffective?  Then I try using finviz screener and STAG is the only one to show some good fundamentals.  What am I supposed to be looking at fundamentally?  Is there a difference for fundamentals for a reit versus a common stock?  I understand fundamentals as far as personal experience and having a major in finance. But I am seeking reassurance as for what values , ratios, and other data. I should be looking at to find profitable opportunities to buy.  &amp;#x200B;  This is what I have been told to pay attention to or learned online.  All of these fundamentals are from FINVIZ because that is my main stock screener.  P/E , PEG, P/S, P/B, Price/ cash, Price/FCFF, eps growth past 5 years, dividend yield, debt to equity, and operating margin.  I am seeking reassurance or help for me to understand this better. I am honestly just being lazy and just want to make sure I am learning the correct or important stuff.   &amp;#x200B;  edit: I learned a little bit of fundamentals but not much. It is just smarter to go towards the benchmark since a stock would not be capable of consistently beating the benchmark.  so this helped narrow down my choices with  new ones   &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2024-01-02 22:45:10]
[Question about long term investing for a new grad?,;,; Hey! So I‚Äôve been trading for about three years now. I‚Äôve done penny stocks and options where I‚Äôve sat and stared at charts all day, tried to hold long term investments with the little money I had, and basically turned 400 into 600.

[Wash sale question (In comments),;,; Theoretical question here..   I use Fidelity, hoping responses can be in the context to how they post wash sales.   10 shares of AMZN are sold for a loss of $1 each, $10 total loss.   10 shares more are purchased same day resulting in a wash sale. These purchases show a W and the cost value has an added $1/ share   If you continue to buy 10 more shares, these also show a W and the cost value goes up $1/share.   In this example, your loss on sale was $10 but fidelity is showing a total added cost of $20 on the 20 stocks you purchased.  My question is, for the 30 day period that the was sale exists post sale - do I have to pay a higher amount on every share I purchased? Or will the total loss be averaged out across the total amount of shares that were purchased during this period?   I freely accept that I may be misinterpreting certain aspects and welcome any correction or clarification,;,; 2023-07-05 16:44:34]
[safe haven The stock market is red-eyed. At present, it is not only bank stocks but also energy stocks that are killing.,;,; Market commentary has pointed out that last year's big tech stocks are now safe havens. The five elephant stocks then bucked the trend and rose:  GOOGL 2.28%  META 1.92%  MSFT 1.78%  AMZN 1.39%  AAPL 0.26%  The auto industry is currently in a recession, and TSLA will be affected, so it has been a little weak recently.  Chip design duo AMD and NVDA have not been dragged down by semiconductors and bucked the trend today. INTC came back from failure, rising 9.35% in the first five trading days.  One strategy is to only buy stocks that have risen sharply rather than stocks that have fallen sharply, because from the lessons of last year, we can understand that thunderstorms have no bottom. Even META TSLA has experienced a collapse of more than 70% from its high point. On the contrary, if the big rising stocks are still 30% to 40% off from the historical high, and the p/e is very low, they are still very cheap.,;,; 2023-03-16 19:15:21]
[How US stocks rose 20% from their lows, and where they might be going,;,; U.S. stocks have defied fears of a recession, a banking crisis and soaring Treasury yields to rise 20% from their October lows - one definition of a bull market.        The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index closed at a low of 3,577.03 on Oct. 12, 2022, down 25% from its all-time high after the Federal Reserve unleashed a series of bruising interest rate increases to fight decades-high inflation.        On Thursday, it closed up 0.6% at 4,293.93, amid growing optimism over the economic outlook and a rate hiking cycle that appears to be nearing its end. Here are some features of the index's rally, and a look at where stocks might go from here.  While markets seldom rise in a straight line, the S&amp;P 500's journey from the bottom took 164 days - the longest 20% climb from a bear market low in five decades. Among the factors holding stocks back was a surge in Treasury yields to their highest levels in decades that dulled the allure of equities by offering investors the potential to earn attractive income in government-backed bonds.        A crisis that saw the biggest bank busts since the Great Recession also shook investor confidence, as did worries over a potentially catastrophic fight over lifting the U.S. debt ceiling.  The narrow breadth of the S&amp;P 500's rally has been a concern for some investors, with just seven stocks - Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) - responsible for almost all of the index's gains this year. Many investors view these stocks as safe bets in uncertain times. Their gains were also driven by excitement over advances in artificial intelligence.  More recently, however, the market's gains have shown tentative signs of broadening out to other stocks.  Meanwhile, volatility has subsided - not only in stocks, but in Treasuries and currencies.        One reason for the calm in markets is investors' belief that the Fed is unlikely to deliver many more of the rate hikes that shook asset prices last year.        Investors have also been encouraged by evidence showing that the U.S. economy continues to be resilient in the face of the central bank's monetary tightening, while inflation slowly cools. The U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (.CESIUSD) shows U.S. economic data has in aggregate topped market expectations, helped by stronger than expected numbers for employment and consumer spending.        A 20% gain from bear market lows has in the past heralded further upside for stocks.  In four of the last six bear markets, the S&amp;P went on to rise 20% or more in the six months after hitting this milestone.

[Microsoft stock hits a record high. Why its next move might be lower,;,; Microsoft stock reached a new all-time closing high‚Äîbut there could be some hiccups ahead in the short term.        Microsoft's stock rose 1.1% to $360.53 on Tuesday. That's a new closing high, topping the previous high of $359.49 set on July 18. Furthermore, Microsoft has won for eight days in a row, its longest winning streak since January 28, 2021.        The stock has been helped by the company‚Äôs strong earnings and sales, which got a boost from the Azure cloud business.        But it‚Äôs not just earnings. Microsoft was already outperforming its peers following tech weakness in August and September. Its stock has gained 15% since the end of September, outpacing Amazon.com (AMZN), which has risen 12%, Meta Platforms (META), which has risen 6.5%, Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), which is up 6%, Alphabet (GOOGL) which has ticked up 0.3%, and Tesla (TSLA), which has dropped 13%.        So, why be concerned? It all comes down to the 14-day relative strength index from Microsoft. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a measure of a stock's or index's momentum, or lack thereof. The closer it comes to 20 on the negative, the more oversold it is, while a score close to 80 indicates that the stock is extremely overbought. A value below 30 usually indicates that a stock is about to rally, while a score above 60 indicates a likely decline. Microsoft's RSI is at 72.75, indicating that it is becoming quite overbought and that a pullback is possible.        That doesn‚Äôt mean Microsoft isn‚Äôt worth buying for its long-term potential. The company has a lot to recommend, including a cloud business that should get a boost as ChatGPT, which held its developer conference yesterday, looks to expand. It just means that investors might get a better opportunity to pick up shares in the days ahead.        ,;,; 2023-11-08 11:35:51]
[Seeking Advice on Reallocating Tech Stock Profits to IRA: Long-Term Gains vs. Retirement Planning,;,;   Hey fellow investors,  I've been holding onto tech stocks like Nvidia, Netflix Amazon, Apple, and a few others since 2017, and they've seen impressive returns ranging from 100% to over 1,000%. Currently, I have around $65,000 invested in these stocks on Robinhood.  Considering the incredible gains over the past seven to eight years, I'm contemplating whether it makes sense to sell some of these long-term holdings and redirect the profits into my IRA accounts. My IRAs have a balance of approximately $72,000, and this year, I lack the additional income to contribute to my retirement accounts.  The idea is to potentially diversify by moving some gains from individual tech stocks into more traditional investment vehicles, such as a target retirement fund, total stock market index fund or an S&amp;P 500 tracking fund within my IRA.  I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences on whether reallocating profits from high-performing tech stocks to retirement accounts is a prudent move, considering the current market conditions and the long-term benefits of retirement planning.  For some more context, I'm a 34 year old male with no major debt, I own a house with mortgage payments of about $1600 a month and about 190k in homeowners equity, and I have no car or student loan payments.  Some of my long term tech holdings are as follows:  NVDA - $28,000, 1300% return;  AMZN - $9,000, 137% return;  NFLX - $6,200, 220% return;  AAPL - $14,000, 340% return   I have some more small tech holdings totaling the rest.

[Should I buy different ETFs depending on the type of account? IRA account vs. Individual Investment account.,;,; My mother recently passed away, and I inherited two Fidelity accounts that she had. One of the accounts was her IRA account. The other was an individual investment account. After taking a look at both of them, I realized that she has a ton of money in bonds. This made sense for someone her age, but for me, I'd like to completely revamp these accounts since I'm 32 years with a much higher risk tolerance.    She also has a ton of different individual stocks (over 70 different individual stocks) that I'd like to consolidate and use mostly ETFs instead. I will post my portfolio plan of action below. My main question is, should I be focusing mainly on ETFs that are dividend driven for the IRA account? While focusing mainly on non-dividend ETFs for my investment account? I know that with IRA accounts, you do not get taxed on dividends as yearly income like you would for investment accounts. I plan on buying the following ETFs for my investment account.   50% VOO (ETF)- Vanguard 500 Index Fund - 500 largest companies.  15% VTI (ETF)- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund - Overall stock market.  10% AVUV (ETF)- Avantis US Small Cap Value -  US small-cap.  10% QQQ (ETF) - Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 - Invesco QQQ - Technology, NASDAQ top 100....Apple, Google, Microsoft, ect.  10% Individual Stocks - NVDA, META, AAPL, AMZN, MCD, TSLA, SHOP, etc.  5% XXUS (ETF)- VXUS-Vanguard Total International Stock ETF - ETF with international exposure.    Should I approach my IRA account any differently? For example instead of these ETFs mentioned above, maybe get more dividend driven ETFs such as SCHD, VYM, SPYD, DGRO, etc?,;,; 2023-09-05 00:05:30]

[Why Disney (DIS) is a no brainer buy right now,;,;  Disney owns timeless characters and brands that have been entertaining people for decades. After a decade of great returns for shareholders, the stock didn't have the best outing last year, falling about 44%. But with Disney's streaming business continuing to gain new subscribers and the company's theme parks benefiting from a pickup in travel, the future looks bright for the Magic Kingdom.   Disney+ core subscriber count ended calendar 2023 at 104 million, excluding the international Hotstar service.¬†That is tremendous growth since the service launched in 2019, thanks to a seemingly never-ending pipeline of Star Wars and Marvel content.  Meanwhile, Disney's theme parks are performing exceptionally well. The parks, experiences, and products segment reported a 21% year-over-year increase in revenue last quarter.¬†Operating profits grew even faster at 25%, reflecting solid operating leverage and digital initiatives at the parks to improve the guest experience and lift margins.¬†  Disney has a strong lineup of films and original series this year, including a new *Indiana Jones* film, *The Little Mermaid*, and season three of *The Mandalorian* on Disney+.¬†The recent release of *Avatar: The Way of Water* was the fourth-biggest launch of all time, bringing in $2.2 billion at the box office.¬†Disney is wasting no time capitalizing on *Avatar*'s popularity by announcing a new *Avatar* experience coming to Disneyland.  Disney has been turning success at the box office into a lucrative stream of revenue for decades. It has literally thousands of characters across all its franchises that it can mine for years of entertainment.¬†With the stock trading about 50% off its highs, now is a ¬†great time to buy the stock before the market changes its mind.¬†,;,; 2023-03-26 02:37:38]
[Should I wait for Amazon to go back up to the price I bought it at before selling or sell it now at a loss for the tax break?,;,; I have a couple of stocks in a moo moo account that I wanted to transfer to Fidelity but I just found out that it costs $75 for each stock to transfer. There's no way I'm going to pay that so my other option to move the stocks that I have in moo moo is to just sell them and rebuy them back in Fidelity.   The only stock I actually bought with moo moo was Amzn(the others were shares just given to me)when it was $111. I bought $1,000 worth. It's obviously down right now so I was curious if it's better for me to sell it now at a loss and get the tax break for next year or just wait for it to go back to what I bought it for and then sell it and rebuy it in Fidelity.   I want to have all of my investments with Fidelity so that's why I'm looking to close out my moo moo account. Any help would be appreciated. I just started investing last year so still learning.

[Question About Good Faith Violations (non-margin/cash account),;,; With a cash account (no margin), let‚Äôs say someone want to make 1 swing trade per day, every single day using their full account balance.

[Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,;,; From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/apple-to-spend-billions-more-on-entertainment-7370447)  "Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.  KEY TAKEAWAYS Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.  The company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.  Previously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.  The move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.  Apple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release.  The company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.  The company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.  The new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).  Apple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.  So far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.  Apple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year.  In each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.  Apple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed."  Personally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.,;,; 2023-03-28 09:45:06]

[Are any of these stocks I just bought yesterday good swing trades for the holiday season coming?,;,; I went and looked for a few hundred ticker symbols of mega, large and mid cap - also a few small caps. Saw a few that are either retail or in a space that should do good as the holiday season approaches. Here are a few of them with why I bought:   TGT \[Target\] = Target has its problems such as organized theft like most chain stores do. Target also has its base of customers that want to shop there and nowhere else. Looking the last 10 years over it usually performs well between September and January, about 70% of the time (some of its best runs came from fall - late winter).   W \[Wayfair\] = Wayfair has its base of customers that are loyal to it. Although it had a boom and bust cycle from 2020 until now due to COVID restrictions going from being a thing to not anymore - I see this stock as a good play for the next 6 months. People are still moving (upper middle class) and finding new jobs, many that require relocation. People who helped pump W to go over 10X in 2020 are the same people who will buy things from them during the holiday season, if they move hundreds of miles away, etc.   ORCL \[Oralce\] = They are a powerhouse of a company - the small caps cannot compete, and I am unaware of a single company that I've used who has stopped using them to use another product. Seems oversold (for those who know about charts - it has a double top). [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ORCL&amp;p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ORCL&amp;p=d)   NG \[Novagold Resources Inc.\] = The price of gold the last few weeks has plummeted 5%, and it has for no reason. A company that I like is NG and they report earnings next week. They have a multiple bottom in their charts for chart people.

[What would you buy for a short-term medium risk profit expectation right now? Would you sell your most disappointing stock to buy that?,;,; I started investing a couple of months ago and a little confused at the current situation. I am in no position to add cash this month to my portfolio so I am thinking changing one of my stocks to another or to an ETF.  I have ABBV at a -15% loss and the expectations seem to be more struggle for a year or two in the future. I am thinking of selling ABBV to buy another stock. For motivational purposes, a short-term medium-risk profit buy would be best for me.  What would you recommend me to buy in that case? Or selling ABBV at a loss right now is not a good move even for the short-term goals?  Thanks in advance...  EDIT: I decided to just wait for the earnings report at least for ABBV and if I sell, buy some VOO or AVUV. Would not touch tech stocks right now, but would not sell my MSFT either.

[What is your process for discovering/reviewing stocks?,;,; I've been trading for a couple of years and lately I've been doing very well by paying attention to relationships and divergences among stocks/ETFs/commodities. Trying to understand and exploit the ebb and flow among sectors. Attempting to identify where long-term accumulation is taking place. First and foremost I watch SPY/QQQ/IWM, ES/NQ/RTY, VIX/VX, DXY/USD, and the 10Y. I also watch the SPDR Sector Funds like XLK, XLF, XLV, XLU, XLY, XLE, XLP, XBI, etc. Additionally, IWC (micro-caps) and IJH (mid-caps).   And VTI (whole stock market ETF) and VT (whole world market ETF) I watch on the weekly chart to get a sense for where the world markets are trending in general. I haven't branched into other markets much, mainly focused on identifying   1) where the current strength in the market is   2) whether the market is remaining orderly/non-volatile   3) how much divergence is taking place among sectors/stocks (e.g. last year felt like indiscriminate selling, this year the divergences are tremendous)  For individual stocks, I basically rifle through stocks with setups that interest me and I really lack organization for what I have on my charts during a trading day. I use Thinkorswim and typically have about 20 charts up across 3 monitors. It's been a challenge to manage my screen real estate and I still change things up all the time, haven't found a solid methodology I guess for what I have pulled up. Undoubtedly what you have pulled up can effect what you trade, how you perceive the market throughout the day, etc.   A lot of times I have AAPL, TSLA, GOOG, AMZN, up at all times. From there I have a mix of stocks from other sectors, maybe a couple wildcards like a small cap/squeeze name. But generally my goal is to display to myself options that I'm unlikely to be severely wrong on, or end up taking a big loss on. I go through and adjust what I'm looking to every night, but admittedly I do need more organization, journaling, and operating more systematically.    So what is your process for evaluating the market? Discovering stocks and setups. What do you have open during the trading day? How many charts? Do you purposefully limit what you see? Do you use any websites/tools to organize your watchlist(s)? Give me your wisdoms,;,; 2023-07-04 18:57:31]
[Wouldn't it be much more logical to swing trade in Roth IRA's and long-term hold in regular accounts instead of the exact opposite?,;,; Wait a second before you have a meltdown over this. Hear me out, then tell me that I'm a dumbass.  It's my belief that most people turn into the Boglehead types over time because of their experiences with paying taxes on short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains. Newer investors don't have the experience with dealing with their taxes as much, so they tend to swing for the fences with shorter-term positions.  More seasoned investors tend to buy and hold, but this is a learned behavior because they know that their absolute worst case tax scenario on a long-term gain is 20 percent (federally). Of course, you only pay the 20 percent on long-term cap gains if you're income is over like 492k or something. Most end up paying about 15 percent federal tax on their long-term cap gains. Short-term cap gains seem to be taxed almost double that amount, obviously it depends on your exact tax bracket situation, but you get the point.  Thus, it's been beaten into the heads of seasoned investors that it's just smarter in the long run to hold positions for at least a year, because your tax bill is often cut in half, or almost in half. You do this long enough, and it becomes ingrained in your investing personality.  All of this makes perfect sense to me.  Ok, now let's talk about Roth IRA's. With Roth IRA's, if you're doing things correctly, there's ZERO taxes on your earnings when you're taking your money out. Obviously you need to be 59 1/2 years old and you need to have passed the 5-year rule, etc., etc.  But if ultimately there's no tax implications whatsoever for investments that are under the Roth umbrella, why do most people tend to hold things for the long-term, and be ultraconservative?  **WAIT!**  I already know what you're going to say, but I'm going to argue that it's nonsensical. You're going to say because Roth IRA's are designed for retirement, and when you get up to that age you should be a lot more risk adverse, because you really need this money for your retirement and you can't be screwing around, taking penitentiary chances.  However, here's my argument to that. Consider all of your investments, Roth and normal brokerages as this large bucket of water. Most ~~people~~ investors will have a Roth account and a regular brokerage account. Due the limitations on how much you can get into a Roth each year, it's likely that most people will have at least 5 to 6 times as much money in their regular brokerage accounts as their Roth accounts. For example.... Imagine somebody has 50k grand total in various Roth accounts. Maybe a standard issue Roth and a 401k Roth. But they have 250k in a "normal" brokerage account.  In this scenario, less than 17 percent of their overall investment money is in their Roth. So, the argument that they need to be ULTRA CAREFUL WITH THEIR ROTH MONEY is pretty illogical, because it's such a small percentage of their overall scenario.  **Wouldn't it be tremendously more logical to actually trade that 17 percent of their account more aggressively, when it's the only 17 percent that isn't negatively affected by moving in and out of stocks?**  Think about the guy that has Microsoft stock. Been holding MSFT for years. He knows the ups and downs. The peaks and valleys. He can probably tell you countless times he would have taken profits if only there wasn't a major tax consequence. So, he doesn't take profits when the stock gets ahead of itself, and then buy back in during a retracement. But his reasoning is tax implications. Inside a Roth, there's no tax implications. Thus, this same investor could sell out of MSFT when he thinks it's gotten ahead of itself, and then buy back in during a retracement and end up with more overall shares. All with no taxable implications whatsoever.  Now obviously, nobody can predict the future and sometimes people are going to get it wrong. They'll sell MSFT when they think the stock has gotten way ahead of itself and then it continues to go on a tear and now he can't buy back in and still have the same number of shares.  But by the same token, just talk to any Amazon investor over the last three years. That shit has basically gone pretty much nowhere for a three-year period. So the whole buy and hold forever strategy hasn't worked out that great for AMZN holders.   It cuts both ways. Don't just cherry pick the example of it hurting.,;,; 2023-09-04 19:40:02]
[FactSet's Earnings Update with 84% of the the S&amp;P 500 Companies Reporting (about 80% of market cap),;,; [Here's the usual weekly Factset update](https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-august-4-2023).  # Earnings and Revenue YoY Decline  With 84% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (and 80% of the market cap roughly) having reported, the new blended earnings estimate is -5.2% YoY--one week ago, their estimate was -7.4%, so we surprised to the upside. The blended revenue estimate is +0.6% YoY. [Blended just means combine estimates of companies that haven't reported with those that have]  # Beating/Missing Earnings  &gt; Of these companies, 79% have reported actual EPS above estimates, which is above the 5-year average of 77% and above the 10-year average of 73%. [...]  &gt; In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings that are 7.2% above estimates, which is below the 5-year average of 8.4% but above the 10-year average of 6.4%.  So 80% are beating (on average 73% do), and they are beating estimates by 7.2% on average (which is typical). Yes, analysts lowered estimates.  # Sectoral Breakdown  The year over year declines in earnings are driven entirely by 3 sectors: Energy, Materials, and Health Care. All other sectors are seeing year over year growth. Similarly, the revenue declines are only in 3 sectors: utilities, energy, materials. Notice health care missing? In fact, the top 3 sectors by revenue growth are consumer discretionary, financials, and health care. My conclusion is that healthcare's earnings decline is driven by steep margin compression. [Patents expiring? Post-Covid operations increasing costs for insurers?] While energy/materials are just seeing revenue tank and thus earnings.  Top 3 earnings sectors are Consumer discretionary, Communication Services, Industrials. Guessing thanks to AMZN, META, GOOG, CAT.  # Valuations  Valuations are basically a little over average but not insane.  &gt; The forward 12-month P/E ratio is 19.2, which is above the 5-year average (18.6) and above the 10-year average (17.4).

[US stocks take a breather, Nasdaq notches its fifth straight month of gains: Investors gear up for pivotal week,;,; The U.S. stock market has started the week on a lackluster note, with all indices hovering around Friday's closing values. Traders are adopting a more cautious approach as they await crucial events scheduled for the week. The market will be heavily influenced by significant earnings reports, such as Apple's AAPL+ Free Alerts and Amazon's AMZN+ Free Alerts on Thursday, and crucial macroeconomic data, such as PMI readings and the highly anticipated jobs report set to be released on Friday.        The Nasdaq 100 Index is on track for its sixth month of advances, with the last such streak occurring between April and August 2020. The major three indices, the S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and the Dow, inched 0.1% higher, while small caps in the Russell 2000 outperformed by rising 0.9%. The Russell 2000 index is also approaching its 2023 highs at 2,007 points hit on February.        The heartening aspect of the market upside is the broader participation, and LPL Financial's Chief Technical Strategist Adam Turnquist said technicals confirm the development. The relative performance of the average stock is building, and the market's advance/decline line traded at a new 52-week high. Nearly 75% of the S&amp;P 500 stocks were trading above their 200-day moving average, with cyclical sectors seeing the highest percentages among sector peers. International stocks were also participating in the year's rally, with most major global benchmarks now in bull market territory.        In midday trading on Monday, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust was flat at $457, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF was unchanged at $354, and the Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ+ Free Alerts held steady at $383. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE outperformed, rising 1.9%, while the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund XLV was the laggard, down 1.1%.        Latest economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas's manufacturing sector general business activity index hit a four-month high of -20.0 in July 2023, marking the second consecutive monthly increase.

The dominant global designer and supplier of AI chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market for custom AI chips and shield itself from the growing number of companies pursuing alternatives to its products.  The Santa Clara, California-based company controls about 80% of high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock market value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023.  Nvidia's customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT.O), opens new tab, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab and Meta Platforms (META.O), opens new tab, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of its chips to compete in the fast-emerging generative AI sector.  Its H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time to design.  Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to rival firms such as Broadcom (AVGO.O), opens new tab and Marvell Technology (MRVL.O), opens new tab, said the sources, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  "If you're really trying to optimize on things like power, or optimize on cost for your application, you can't afford to go drop an H100 or A100 in there," Greg Reichow, general partner at venture capital firm Eclipse Ventures said in an interview. "You want to have the exact right mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need."  Nvidia does not disclose H100 prices, which are higher than for the prior-generation A100, but each chip can sell for $16,000 to $100,000 depending on volume and other factors. Meta plans to bring its total stock to 350,000 H100s this year. Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon.com (AMZN.O), opens new tab, Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for them, two sources familiar with the meetings said. Beyond data center chips, Nvidia has pursued telecom, automotive and video game customers.  Nvidia shares rose 2.75% after the Reuters report, helping lift chip stocks overall. Marvell shares dropped 2.78%.  In 2022, Nvidia said it would let third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking technology with their own chips. It has said nothing about the program since, and Reuters is reporting its wider ambitions for the first time. A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company's 2022 announcement.  Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), opens new tab and Marvell executive, heads Nvidia's custom unit and her team's goal is to make its technology available for customers in cloud, 5G wireless, video games and automotives, a LinkedIn profile said. Those mentions were scrubbed and her title changed after Reuters sought comment from Nvidia.  Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment.     **$30 BILLION MARKET**  According to estimates from research firm 650 Group‚Äôs Alan Weckel, the data center custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year, and double that in 2025.  The broader custom chip market was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023, which amounts to roughly 5% of annual global chip sales, according to Needham analyst Charles Shi.  Currently, custom silicon design for data centers is dominated by Broadcom and Marvell.  In a typical arrangement, a design partner such as Nvidia would offer intellectual property and technology, but leave the chip fabrication, packaging and additional steps to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330.TW), opens new tab or another contract chip manufacturer.  Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales.  "With Broadcom's custom silicon business touching $10 billion, and Marvell‚Äôs around $2 billion, this is a real threat," said Dylan Patel, founder of silicon research group SemiAnalysis. "It's a real big negative - there's more competition entering the fray."  **BEYOND AI**  Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson (ERICb.ST), opens new tab for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics processing unit (GPU) technology, two sources familiar with the discussions said. Ericsson declined to comment.  650 Group's Weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year. Nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video game markets, according to sources and public social media postings.  Weckel expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6 billion to $8 billion range at 20% a year, and the $7 billion to $8 billion video game custom chip market could increase with the next-generation consoles from Xbox and Sony (6857.T), opens new tab.  Nintendo's current Switch handheld console already includes Nvidia's Tegra X1 chip. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is likely to include a Nvidia custom design, one source said.  Nintendo declined to comment.,;,; 2024-02-09 23:15:02]
[Netflix (NFLX) DCF Analysis.,;,; # INTRODUCTION:  NFLX has come a long way since being rejected by blockbuster, its secret formula being the first to embrace change. It embraced DVD at a time where VHS was still the dominant mode of display. It embraced Streaming when the world started catching onto DVD. NFLX's edge was that it always pivoted quickly to the next big thing. But NFLX‚Äôs massive progress may soon grind to a halt. From lackluster solutions to strong competitors and pure market saturation, NFLX has a tough road ahead.       **INVESTMENT THESIS 1:**  *Overblown Growth Solutions*  When NFLX lost subscribers for the first time in 10 years, people freaked out and started selling off NFLX. But it seems that when NFLX announced its plans and after 1 successful quarter with some results from Ad-Tier NFLX bounced back up almost doubling from when it first dropped due to the shock.       Ad-Tier has some parallels to pirated sites. Both stream contents with Ads injected into the mix, either before the video plays or on the side of the screen. The main difference is that one is free and the other costs $6.99/month.  There are only so many people in the world that wants a YouTube equivalent as their streaming platform. The people who purchase Ad-Tier are usually ‚Äúseasonal‚Äù fans, those that purchase cheaply so that they can watch their favorite series and unsubscribe afterwards. These subscribers have no longevity to them and temporarily bump up NFLX‚Äôs numbers.      Paid-sharing, getting people to get off shared accounts and getting their own accounts. Depending on how NFLX goes about it paid sharing could be a game changer for NFLX. There is already an existing customer base from those that are sharing account, they show a liking for NFLX but whether these customers will convert is dependent on certain factors Effectiveness of Paid-Sharing, ‚ÄòFOMO‚Äô factor and Piracy.  Effectiveness of Paid-Sharing,    Is the net cast wide enough to catch all the paid-sharing users? What are the ways we go about catching Paid-Sharing?  ‚ÄòFOMO‚Äô factor,    Just how much are customers missing out will determine how they weigh the cost of monthly subscription and the ability to participate in the latest series.  Piracy,    Is it easy to find alternatives that can provide what NFLX provides for free?  **INVESTMENT THESIS 2:**  *Strong Competitors &amp; Lack of C.A.*  The usual suspects obviously include DIS, Hulu and AMZN prime. But, what about the less obvious ones?  TikTok &amp; Instagram reels. There‚Äôs only so much entertainment needed in one‚Äôs life. You can‚Äôt possibly simultaneously watch TikTok while watching a NFLX series, your attention can only be paid in one direction. ([SOURCE](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/tiktok-netflix-gen-z-video-broadcast-app/634594/#:~:text=TikTok%20has%20jumped%20over%20Netflix,the%20sixth%20most%20popular%20service))  Or AMZN with an all-inclusive ride on their AMZN prime with AMZN prime offering other benefits on their online retail store. They are ‚ÄúOffer-Stacking‚Äù creating an unbeatable offer that NFLX can‚Äôt counter.   DIS has a large vault of already created storyline that they have archived yet to be released onto Disney+ and the familiarity of DIS‚Äô brand name enhanced by their theme park creates a very strong branding fit for the entire family that NFLX can‚Äôt parallel. ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/294111/leading-organizations-in-licensed-merchandise-worldwide/))  NFLX has no differentiator other than it was the earliest entrant and is now the largest entrant. There are certain exclusive content on NFLX that may make it appealing, but these kinds of advantages are superficial and over the long run, these exclusive content may offer their rights to stream to competitors or may be pirated.          **INVESTMENT THESIS 3:**  *Market Saturation*  NFLX can only grow so much.  UCAN from FY21-22 only added 0.7M subscribers and LATAM added 3M. LATAM‚Äôs market was already said to be 75% penetrated by NFLX ([SOURCE](https://labsnews.com/en/articles/technology/netflix-streaming-leader-latin-america-future/)).  NFLX should focus on making its subscribers more valuable which management has said it will focus on now, but it has only so far laid out plans to attract new subscribers.   Even if Linear Network loses most of its grounds in the next 10 years, NFLX may not gain much subscribers from Linear Network simply because Linear Network is mainly supported by the exact demographic that would not be on NFLX.     # REVENUE:  ***Model***  I‚Äôve used a bottoms-up approach when modelling my revenue and forecasted using historical data and surveys done.  ***Revenue/Subscriber***  NFLX applies third degree price discrimination in how it prices subscriptions/month for different regions. Regions where it has already established a presence and where NFLX integrated into their daily life, NFLX charges a higher subscription/month.      But I don‚Äôt think every region will eventually tend towards the UCAN cost. Certain regions may see subscription services as a luxury good.      Overall, with the implementation and wide rollout of the Ad Tier I project my average revenue/customer to be higher for every region as the Ad Tier generates higher revenue per subscriber monthly, according to management.  According to 2021 US Bureau of Labor Statistics, an American with Annual income of $78,743 and expenditure of $66,928 spent 0.97% of that amount in entertainment and of that 0.97% only 18% goes towards ‚ÄúFees and admissions‚Äù so about 0.17% of $66,928 went towards NFLX. $654 represented the annual spending on subscription services + others. NFLX takes up 30% of this, most households have more than 1 subscription. So, NFLX is probably tethering at the limit at which it can raise prices.      Comparing the cost per month of subscription between NFLX and its closest competitor DIS, Disney+ cost $4.80 compared to NFLX $15.86.        So, I forecast that the majority of increase in Revenue/Subscriber for the US will come from wider adoption of Ad-Tier subscription which yields a higher amount of Revenue/Subscriber rather than NFLX increasing prices.  European subscription is one of the highest cost to subscribe ([SOURCE](https://beebom.com/how-much-netflix-costs-each-country-worldwide/)) so, I'd say its unlikely EMEA will raise monthly subscription cost but rather EMEA is the region with the highest likelihood to group subscribe to lower subscription cost. So EMEA is more likely to add subscribers than revenue/subscriber.   **OVERALL, I assume that the full effects of FOMO for Ad-Tier will only show up from 2025 onwards.**      ***No. of Subscriber***  For Paid Sharing,    NFLX has stated that the potential market could be up to 100+M households. I do also believe that convincing people who were previously sharing accounts of purchasing their own account may take some time to catch on, as they will have large FOMO after being locked out of their old account and missing the latest shows. And since NFLX only intends on fully releasing Paid Sharing from 23Q2 onwards, I believe the substantial addition to subscribers will only show up from 2025 onwards with the FOMO effect in full and Paid Sharing being rolled out entirely.      For fall of Linear Network,   ([SOURCE](https://morningconsult.com/2023/03/28/linear-tv-viewership-gen-z-millennials/))  Almost 40% of Linear Network supporters are baby boomers. As the baby boomers age and decrease in numbers Linear Network will start losing its main customers, freeing up market share for NFLX to take as the younger generations start being associated with Streaming services, streaming will become the new norm.      BUT, this cultural change will be one that takes time. It will not show up to a substantial amount in the time period of my forecast. So I opt for more granularity.         **REVENUE MODEL: \[**[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/9c2expe)\]  # MARGINS:  The difficulty in figuring out margins is that there is no reliable historic data within the past 5 years. Margins were always extremely skewed by extreme conditions.  E.g. from 2019 to 2020 margins jumped from 12% to 18% due to covid accelerating the adoption of NFLX.   OR in 2021 the marginal cost of acquiring content wrt to revenue being generated was the cheapest of the past 7 years at $0.5836 per $1 of revenue generated. Likely because people were embracing NFLX as tech adoption was accelerated prior year, margins peaking only a year later.  So, cost is broken down into 3 categories (Acquisition, Marketing and (Tech &amp; Dev + G&amp;A)). Tech &amp; Dev + G&amp;A are lumped together for more granularity instead of inaccurate forecasts.      ***Acquisition***  As NFLX transitions into subscriber retention mode rather than attracting subscribers it inevitably will spend more on making its services more attractive so that existing customers will face a higher ‚Äúemotional‚Äù switching cost, so churn rate is lowered. But acquisition will continue to take the largest portion of cost.     ***Marketing***  Eventually the NFLX brand becomes more well-known or integrated into people‚Äôs daily life that they spend less on marketing themselves and more on advertising new content. Marketing costs will start to tend downwards. BUT there must always be a baseline amount of marketing cost to advertise new content.      ***Tech &amp; Dev + G&amp;A***  Tech &amp; Dev + G&amp;A is likely to remain elevated for the first few years as NFLX starts to roll out Ad-Tier and begin supporting a substantial amount of new subscribers from Ad-Tier. But eventually as the number of new subscribers dwindles down, NFLX gets more efficient and needs fewer employees. It will also implement new tech features e.g. AI tech support to lower the number of employees necessary. So at that point Tech &amp; Dev + G&amp;A will tend downwards.     **COST MODEL: \[**[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/yX54W9I)**\]**  # COST OF CAPITAL:  ***Cost of Debt***  RFR (3M Average) = 3.53%  Risk Spread (3M Average) = 1.71% ([SOURCE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLC0A4CBBB))  Cost of Debt = 5.24%      ***Timing of Debt***  \[[TABLE](https://imgur.com/a/CoSEpe2)\]  Weighted Average Timing of Debt = 1.57 Years.  MV Debt = 19225M  ***Cost of Equity***  Market Beta = 1.27 ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NFLX?p=NFLX))  Market Price(3M Average) = $341.52  Shares O/S = 445M  MV Equity = 151976M        4105.02 = \[4.58% x 4105.02\] x (1+5%) / (1+R) + (\[4.58% x 4105.02\] x (1+5%)) x (1+3.417%) / R - 3.417% / (1+R) \^2    R = 8.635%    RFR (US) = 3.417%    ERP = 5.218%  COE = 10.16%  ***Weightage***  % Equity = 88.8%  %Debt = 11.2%  ***WACC***  Corporate marginal Tax Rate = 21%  WACC = 9.49%     # CONCLUSION:  Ultimately, I‚Äôve valued NFLX at $174.62, I just don‚Äôt believe in how astronomical growth could be, with all the changes that NFLX has introduced into the company. I believe that NFLX has set their priorities wrongly and are focusing on the wrong things, Subscriber growth shouldn‚Äôt be the focus it should be making our subscribers more profitable. It‚Äôs a good sign that they started caring and innovating again. But at the current trajectory I just don‚Äôt see it working out.

[Streaming stocks,;,; Do you think Streaming stocks are always going to get away with relying monthly subscriptions and ad revenue. There is only so much money they can make. I can not see them just relying on Subscriptions and ad revenue.,;,; 2023-08-23 03:10:26]
[What should I focus on when evaluating a stock if I want to be somewhat conservative?,;,; I recently read an article in Forbes titled "Investment Advice From The Vietnam Veteran Who Turned A 2-Bedroom House Into A $4.7 Billion Fortune" about Arte Moreno and his response to one of their questions made me curious:  &gt;**Forbes: What assets are you buying in this environment?**  &gt;Moreno: There are some stocks in the market right now I like. They get banged up, but I like the asset and you can average down if you look at it that way. Pretty much everything I deal with has some type of return on it; some kind of dividend. If you look back a year ago, we had very low interest rates, like zero. So when you're looking at a stock and not only do you really like the asset, but then they're giving you a dividend, it‚Äôs such a bonus. You're setting yourself up for potential stock growth, but you're also receiving 3% to 4% annually.  &gt; I really try to stay by the book: I like to buy companies at around 15 times price-to-earnings. I have a couple strong positions in Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL). I've been buying Apple forever; every time it goes down, I buy more Apple. I also buy JPMorgan (JPM), which pays about 3% dividend. Another company I really like, and have been invested in for a long time, is Blackstone (BX). The multiple doesn‚Äôt fit in there because it's high, but I just like their whole portfolio of assets.  &gt; I‚Äôm really pretty good about keeping diversified. But I really look at stocks that give you a good dividend. I look at a company that's not generating any cash, has no dividend and has this crazy high PE multiple, and I just stay away. I think it's for other people. It's not for me.  He considers himself a fairly conservative and by the book investor, so I was interested in learning more about how you guys evaluate a stock and what you think of his approach.  For example, one stock that I've been looking at off and on for quite a while now, but don't own, is POSCO (PKX).  They're currently at a 9.32 PE, which is below the 15x that Arte Moreno looks for, but they have a 3.90% dividend and they're generating cash. Is that info enough to make an investment or do you look for more?  Thank you for any help you can provide. I'm genuinely interested in learning more about investing. I have a couple funds for retirement, but I was considering adding another account at Vanguard to invest in maybe 4-5 companies I like once I learn more.,;,; 2023-06-02 04:12:42]
[Top Cathie Wood stock near the buy point is expected to deliver 772% EPS growth.,;,; Cathie Wood often invests in speculative companies with profits that are years away, though Tesla (TSLA) has been profitable for years. So has Shopify (SHOP), a top-10 Ark Invest holding. Thanks to a strategic shift, Shopify earnings growth is expected to skyrocket in 2023, with strong gains continuing next year. And SHOP stock is near a buy point.     **Shopify Logistics Sale**   Shopify announced the sale of its fulfillment business to privately held Flexport on May 4, with the deal closing in June. The e-commerce software giant in recent years had sought to challenge Amazon.com (AMZN) in third-party fulfillment for online orders. But it turned out to be an "expensive experiment."   Shopify now holds a 13% stake in Flexport, but exiting logistics will mean the company can slash costs. Meanwhile, gross merchandise growth is picking up after slowing sharply following the coronavirus pandemic boom.  **Shopify Earnings**    Shopify earnings plunged to 4 cents a share in 2022 from 64 cents in 2021. The end of the pandemic meant a big slowdown in e-commerce growth.        First-quarter earnings, reported May 4 along with the Flexport deal, tumbled 50% vs. a year earlier. Sales grew 25% to $1.51 billion.  **Shopify Earnings**    Shopify earnings plunged to 4 cents a share in 2022 from 64 cents in 2021. The end of the pandemic meant a big slowdown in e-commerce growth.        First-quarter earnings, reported May 4 along with the Flexport deal, tumbled 50% vs. a year earlier. Sales grew 25% to $1.51 billion.  **SHOP Stock**    Shopify stock gapped up 24% on May 4 following first-quarter earnings and the Flexport deal, blasting out of a cup-with-handle base. After peaking at a 52-week high of 65.54 on May 10, shares began to consolidate. SHOP stock briefly broke out to a fresh 52-week high in mid-June, but pulled back with the broader market.        This Cathie Wood stock has once again found support at the 21-day line. Investors could still use 65.64 as a place to start or add to a Shopify stock position. The risks would be elevated if the market pullback is still ongoing.  **Ark Invest Stake**    Ark Invest owns 0.68% of Shopify stock as of June 26. It's the 8th-largest holding across Cathie Wood's Ark ETFs, with a 3.85% weight overall.        While SHOP stock has been a big winner for Ark Invest in 2023, its current position is still underwater. The ARKK, ARKW and ARKF funds have an average cost of $121.32-$128.27.        That's not uncommon. Ark Invest has a big profit in its current Tesla stock holdings. But the other top-10 Cathie Wood stock positions are losers right now, with some more than 75% below Ark's cost basis.

[The 2023 stock market rally got a lot healthier in June and July,;,; https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2023-stock-market-rally-got-a-lot-healthier-in-june-and-july-210139678.html  July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.  The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.  July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.  The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May. [Money doesn't grow on trees]  But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears ‚Äî that the rally had become too concentrated ‚Äî has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.  And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.  This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.  Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.  [**Broadening of the market.**](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Cj8RJI9cSQHXtbHDpHlEqQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2023-07/134ad610-2fe2-11ee-bf6f-1ffefac75b64)  In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.  The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.  Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.  And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)  Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.  In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.  Cyclical names ‚Äî whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy ‚Äî dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).  And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.  The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.  Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart ‚Äî up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.  3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).  Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.  Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.,;,; 2023-08-01 02:38:08]
[Shopify ($SHOP) stock upgraded, claws above 50-day moving average,;,;  **Shopify** ($**SHOP**) is the **IBD Stock of the Day** as the e-commerce firm popped above its **50-day moving average** Wednesday following an analyst upgrade. Shopify remains a controversial stock amid stiff competition.    Started in 2006, Canada-based Shopify sets up e-commerce websites for small businesses and partners with others to handle digital payments and shipping.   It competes with **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **PayPal Holdings** ($**PYPL**), **Wix** ($**WIX**), **BigCommerce** ($**BIGC**), and several others.  On the¬†**stock market today**, Shopify was up more than 4% at one point but gave back some of those gains as the market fell. Shares ended the trading day 1.2% higher to 45.30. Shares have climbed 30.5% in 2023 versus the Nasdaq's 14% gain in the wake of last year's downturn.  In a period of consolidation, Shopify stock has a traditional **entry point** of 54.76.  ## Earnings Due For Shopify Stock  More aggressive investors could consider taking a position at 48.36 amid a handle still in formation. The handle would be in the lower half of the base, which is a flaw.  Earnings for Shopify stock are due in early May. ¬†Investors may want to be cautious ahead of the earnings report. One strategy around earnings would use **call options**.  At JMP Securities, analyst Andrew Boone on Wednesday upgraded Shopify to market outperform from market perform with a price target of 65.  Further, Shopify is building a U.S. distribution network to store and ship products for its merchant customers. Rising investments for the distribution network have been one overhang on the stock.  ## Amazon Ramps 'Buy With Prime' For Merchants  In addition, Amazon has launched a new initiative. Amazon is offering its massive distribution network to outside merchants. Merchants who do not sell goods on¬†its website can use Amazon's product fulfillment services for delivery and returns as part of a program called Buy With Prime.  ## SHOP Stock Gained During Pandemic  At MoffettNathanson, analyst Lisa Ellis also views Shopify as a market share taker.  "Selling shovels to miners in an e-commerce gold rush is the perfect business," Ellis said in a note. "Shopify seized the opportunity of the (coronavirus) pandemic and now powers 10% of all U.S. e-commerce. The gold rush has slowed. Shopify's multiple has contracted as investors digest a secular growth story transitioning to one of increased capital intensity and questions on profitability."  Meanwhile, Shopify stock holds an IBD **Composite Rating**¬†of 85 out of the best possible 99, according to¬†**IBD Stock Checkup**.  IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. Also, the best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.  Further, Shopify stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. Its current rating indicates more funds are buying than selling.  ## Shopify Stock: 2023 Revenue Outlook Missed  The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures the institutional buying and selling of stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.  For the period ended Dec. 31, Shopify said it earned 7 cents per share on an adjusted basis, down 50% from a year earlier. Also, revenue for Shopify stock rose 26% to $1.7 billion, the company said.  Analysts expected the Shopify earnings report to record a loss of 1 cent on revenue of $1.65 billion. A year earlier, Shopify earned 14 cents per share on revenue of $1.38 billion.  For the first quarter of 2023, the company predicted revenue growth in the "high teens." Analysts had projected more than 20% revenue growth. And in January, Shopify hiked contract prices for merchants.,;,; 2023-04-13 06:31:11]
[Keep portfolio / Sell portfolio and put all into Term Deposits. What would you do?,;,; Hi guys! I'm looking for some advice / points of view on something. For the last couple of weeks i've been thinking and thinking what i should do with my portfolio / investment strategy. So, I'm from Europe, and i currently have some money invested into the US market + some spare money (I'll show the percentages below). Right know, i have some spare money and i have the possibility to it into some Term deposits with maturity from 1 month, up to 3 years, which i think pays out quite good or just keep DCA into the market.  Ok so first, my portfolio right now is still positive overall and it looks like this: VOO - 25%, QQQ - 18%, NVDA - 12%, AAPL - 11%, MSFT - 10%, GOOGL - 7%, RKLB - 3%, UNH - 3% and the rest 11% split into V, ASTS, MA, HD, AMZN, TGT, DIS, BA and TSLA. For the past year or so, i didn't add anything to individual stocks and just DCA into VOO/QQQ every month.  Now, the banks right now have these interests (i've selected from different banks, the best ones for each maturity period): 1 month - 5.7%, 3 months - 7.3%, 6 months - 7.5%, 1 year - 8.2%, 2 years - 8.45%, 3 years - 8.7%. But before you say holy s\*\*t, these are good returns, right now, here, the inflation rate is at 15% (which in reality i think it's even worse), so it's not that great if you look at it that way.  Looking at the market right now, 7.5% or 8.2% seems pretty good. I know the market average return is around 8% to 9% but I'm not sure the market is gonna have these kind of returns (at least the next few years?). But i could be right, i could be wrong of course. I just don't feel like it's gonna do great next period, that's all.  So now back to my dilemma... As i said, for the past year i just DCA each month into VOO/QQQ. Besides what's already invested, i have some spare cash i would like to deploy right now and i see these scenarios.  \- Sell the portfolio, and put it all + spare money + new money each month into term deposits (6 months or 1 year maturity)  \- Keep portfolio as it is and put spare money + new money each month into term deposits  \- Keep portfolio and put the spare money into it + DCA each month as usual and ignore the term deposits  If i missed something, maybe a better option or some information that i missed and might be really important to take into consideration, please tell me. Right now i'm something like 60/40 into second scenario. Just don't touch the portfolio, but put the rest of the money into these deposits (i was thinking the 1 year one may be the best one ?), until the market stabilizes a bit. Also, im in my twenties, so my investment hold period is long. I don't need the money any time soon (that's 1 of the reason why i think the option to keep DCA into the market may be better because of the compound interest?).  I could really use some advice on this guys. What would you do in this situation? Sorry if some terms are not right or something, as im not from US, some things related to investing may be different and i might wrongly translate them. Thanks a lot guys!  TLDR: You have spare money right now. How you choose to use it? Sell portfolio and put everything into Term deposits (at least for the next couple of years) / Keep portfolio and put rest into Term deposits / Ignore the Term deposits and keep DCA into the market as usual.,;,; 2023-03-13 16:09:59]
[(4/28) Friday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,;,; #Good Friday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the final trading day of this week, and month of April.

S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures slipped 0.3% each. ***** &gt; Amazon shares were down about 1% after initially rising following the online retailer‚Äôs first-quarter results. Meanwhile, Snap tumbled 18% in extended trading following a revenue miss. Pinterest shares fell 14% after issuing disappointing second-quarter revenue growth expectations. ***** &gt; The earnings season has been better than expected. Of the 261 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported earnings, about 80% have reported positive surprises, according to FactSet data. ***** &gt; Still, some traders expressed skepticism that this earnings season is strong. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt take us out of an earnings recession. We‚Äôre still in an earnings recession. And this calendar quarter, which we are in right now, we are going to see the most intense economic contraction and potentially the deepest earnings contraction of what will be a sequential three quarter decline,‚Äù Virtus Investment Partners‚Äô Joseph Terranova said Thursday on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell.‚Äù ***** &gt; On the more positive side, Intel shares climbed more than 4% after the semiconductor firm beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. ***** &gt; Investors are coming off a strong trading session for the major averages, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 notching their best day since January. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2%, posting its best day since March. ***** &gt; Those gains come after a better-than-expected report from Meta fueled a rally in tech stocks. Investors appeared to shake off light GDP data that could signal the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate-hiking campaign may soon come to an end. ***** &gt; On the economic front, traders will watch for the latest personal income and spending data, due out Friday before the open. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting core prices to have risen 0.3% in March from the prior month. That‚Äôs in line with the prior reading. ***** &gt; The final reading of the April consumer sentiment data is also set to be released Friday at 10 a.m. ET.

[Tesla just turned a huge financial burden into a $12.9 billion revenue opportunity.,;,; * Tesla recently added two of the world's largest carmakers to its EV charging network. * Just weeks later, more automobile manufacturers are making -- or considering -- the move.  * Some investors are viewing this as an opportunity comparable to Amazon's rollout of AWS.  #  The electric vehicle maker might be having an "AWS moment."  The past couple of years have been a bumpy ride for Tesla (TSLA). After rocketing to an all-time high in late 2021, the stock plunged more than 70% in the face of high inflation, rising interest rates, and the worst stock market downturn in more than a decade. But the tide appears to have turned over the past several months. Since bottoming in early January, Tesla shares have been on fire, gaining 149% as of this writing.   What caused this epic run? A rebound in the stock market and the recovering economy were no doubt contributors, but the biggest gains have come over the past few weeks in the wake of a few historic announcements. Several big-name automakers have ceded the high ground, joining the Tesla Supercharger network and adopting its North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector, which is now on the road to becoming the industry standard on the continent.   This stampede of partnerships prompts the question: Is Tesla having an "AWS moment"?  # The agreements driving Tesla stock higher   Late last month, Ford announced that beginning early next year, Ford electric vehicle (EV) owners would gain access to more than 12,000 Tesla charging stations across the U.S. Ford's chief customer officer, Marin Gjaja, cited Tesla's "large, reliable and efficient charging system" as the incentive.        Just weeks later, General Motors announced that it, too, would join the Tesla Supercharger network. On Tuesday, Rivian jumped on the bandwagon, joining the company's North American network, while Hyundai is considering a similar move.   In each case, the automakers have noted that after initially requiring an adapter, they would equip future EVs with an NACS charge port within the next couple of years, eliminating the need for adapters going forward.  #   The cloud connection   Back in 2000, Amazon (AMZN) was hamstrung by a number of growth-related issues, the biggest being the ability to scale its nascent operations. To address this challenge, the company developed a cloud infrastructure system that would form the foundation for its growing e-commerce business.        At the time -- and unbeknownst to Amazon executives -- the company had planted the seeds that would eventually become Amazon Web Services (AWS), its lucrative cloud computing service. After being used solely by Amazon employees for several years, the service debuted to the public in early 2006, and the company began renting out the cloud infrastructure it originally developed for in-house use. And the rest -- as they say -- is history.         AWS quickly become one of Amazon's most lucrative enterprises, a paradigm that continues to this day. In 2022, AWS generated revenue of more than $80 billion, up 29% year over year. More importantly, the cloud computing business was responsible for just 15% of Amazon's total revenue but all of its operating income -- even subsidizing the losses from its e-commerce operations.   The company is still the leader in the cloud business it pioneered, closing out the first quarter with a 32% share of the cloud infrastructure market, which is as much as the shares of Microsoft and Alphabet combined, according to data supplied by research firm Canalys.         The parallel here is clear. Tesla originally developed the Supercharger network solely for use by its customers, but it appears to be transforming into a lucrative industry standard.  # AWS moment?   The ability to take a substantial business costs and turn them into a hefty revenue generator is a rare thing, which is why some are calling this Tesla's "AWS moment." Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is one such commentator. He notes that while the company is known for accelerating EV adoption around the globe, Tesla's Supercharger network is the hidden gem that will take the company -- and its stock -- to the next level:         I believe "what has changed" for the Street over the last month is the recognition with the Ford and GM supercharger partnerships that Tesla's sum-of-the-parts valuation is now finally starting to get tapped into. This reminds us of when the Street started to realize the margin story and valuation at AWS for Amazon.        He goes on to estimate that the pacts with Ford and GM could add another $3 billion to Tesla's EV charging revenue "over the next few years."        Piper Sandler agrees and is more precise in its estimates, estimating that charging from non-Tesla customers could add $3 billion to revenue by 2030, surging to $5.4 billion by 2032. A greater number of EVs on the road -- from numerous automakers -- will no doubt accelerate this "flywheel effect," enriching Tesla and its shareholders along the way.         The company is also vying for roughly $7.5 million in subsidies offered by the Biden administration to expand its Supercharger network if other automakers have access to its system. In all, this amounts to nearly $13 billion in additional financial incentives for Tesla to open up its network.         It's also worth noting that Tesla also has a significant advantage over its rivals with one of the most cost-effective chargers in the business. The company has been able to construct charging stations for as little as $42,000 per connector, compared to a range of $100,000 to $250,000 for its rivals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tesla can use the additional funds from non-Tesla customers to expand its Supercharger network, further fueling the flywheel.         While it's still early days for these charging collaborations, this could eventually be a big revenue generator for Tesla.  #  The fine print   As previously noted, Tesla's stock price has soared this year -- up nearly 50% in the past month alone -- as a result of the recent announcements, with a commensurate increase in its valuation. The stock currently has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 77 and sells for over eight times forward sales -- a lofty valuation by any measure. For context, analysts expect the company to grow revenue by 22% and 29%, respectively, in 2023 and 2024. Value investors will no doubt balk at the stock's hefty price tag.        That said, Tesla is the undisputed leader in the U.S. EV market and is just beginning to flex its charging station muscles. If the company eventually adopts a similar strategy for batteries and energy storage solutions, Tesla's recent gains could be just the beginning for those with a long-term outlook.    ,;,; 2023-06-26 09:32:17]

[How Shopify ($SHOP) 'shape shift' made e-commerce firm attractive again,;,; E-commerce software and services provider Shopify ($SHOP) suddenly looks a lot different to investors in the wake of a strategy shift. Canada-based Shopify in early June completed the sale of its fulfillment unit, easing investor angst over rising investments for SHOP stock.        With the move, Canada-based Shopify slashed capital spending and improved its financial outlook.        "Post the recent 'shape shift' where it exited the logistics business and reduced over 20% of the workforce, the company is free cash flow positive," said UBS analyst Kunal Madhukar in a recent report.     **Covid Emergency E-Commerce Boost**    Further, Shopify stock has jumped 90% in 2023 as of June 14. Shopify stock has gained 42% since the company announced the sale of the fulfillment business to privately held Flexport on May 4. SHOP stock rebounded from a 2022 sell-off spurred by worries over growing investments and management turnover.        Shares are trading near a 14-month high, trying to clear a short consolidation forged after surging on May 4 following the first-quarter earnings report and the Flexport deal.   "While SFN (Shopify Fulfillment Network) turned out to be an expensive experiment, we also must recognize that Shopify made a fast pivot ‚Äî taking calculated risks can sometimes lead to strategic mistakes," said Baird analyst Colin Sebastian in a report. "We still believe Shopify can be a trillion-dollar GMV (gross merchandise volume) platform with take rates expanding as the company widens in scope."        In 2022, Shopify's GMV growth slowed to 12% ($197.2 billion). GMV growth has been trending down since 2020 when it boomed 96% during the coronavirus pandemic. Consumers shifted to online shopping during the emergency. In addition, Shopify in 2022 accounted for roughly 18% of all U.S. e-commerce, says UBS.        According to research firm Gartner, Shopify is the largest e-commerce software provider with about 15% global share, ahead of SAP (SAP) and Salesforce (CRM). Shopify garners nearly two-thirds of revenue from the U.S.        Shopify sets up e-commerce websites for businesses. It partners with companies such as Stripe to handle digital payments. Well-funded and fast-growing Stripe has put off an initial public offering.        Among merchants services is Shop Pay. It's an accelerated checkout option for stores on the Shopify platform. Shopify Capital provides loans to merchants. The new Shop Cash rewards program provides consumers with incentives, aiming to boost GMV through higher orders.        **SHOP Stock: PayPal Friction?**    Meanwhile, Shopify has encroached on PayPal Holdings (PYPL), said Lisa Ellis, analyst at SVB MoffettNathanson in a report.        "PayPal and Shopify have a long-standing partnership and PayPal enjoys a privileged position on the Shopify platform," said Ellis in a report. "However, many of Shopify's payments-related initiatives pose a competitive threat to PayPal."        She noted Shopify Payments, a payment processing service offered through Stripe. Ellis also noted a "buy now, pay later" consumer financing service that Shopify now offers through Affirm Holdings (AFRM).        Meanwhile, to build up a logistics business that stored and shipped products for its merchant customers, Shopify had acquired Deliverr for $2.1 billion in 2022. In 2019 it bought startup 6 River Systems for $450 million.        Flexport will be Shopify's logistics partner under a revenue-sharing arrangement. Shopify now holds a 13% equity interest in Flexport.        **Shopify To Join Amazon Buy With Prime?**   Amid the sale, there's also speculation over a possible Shopify deal with e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN).        Amazon now offers its massive distribution network to merchants that do not sell goods on its website. Amazon's product fulfillment services are part of a program called Buy With Prime.        At UBS, Madhukar says Shopify could join the Buy With Prime program based on management comments on Shopify's first-quarter earnings call.        "The company said things are moving positively in their discussions with Amazon on BwP, which could suggest they may be closer to getting a deal done," Madhukar said. "Although it is still unclear whether a deal will make SHOP whole on gross profit dilution, a resolution could result in a better merchant and consumer experience, and lead to higher volumes that may offset any potential dilution."        Also, Shopify rival BigCommerce (BGIC) uses Amazon's fulfillment services.        Started in 2006, Shopify recently hiked contract prices for merchants.        In the quarter ended March 31, Shopify earned one cent per share on an adjusted basis, down a penny from a year earlier. Revenue for SHOP stock rose 25% to $1.5 billion, the company said.        Analysts expected the Shopify earnings report to show a loss of 4 cents on revenue of $1.435 billion. Gross merchandise volume rose 15% to $49.6 billion, topping estimates of $47.75 billion.        In 2023, Wall Street analysts expect adjusted profit to boom to 33 cents a share from 4 cents last year. Shopify earnings per share is projected to rise 70% to 56 cents in 2024.    Revenue will rise 20% to $6.74 billion this year and 18% in 2024 to $7.93 billion, analysts predict.        Shopify Stock: Enterprise Marketing Push    To spur GMV growth for SHOP stock, Shopify has partnered with Facebook (FB), Pinterest (PINS) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google in social media marketing.        Meanwhile, analysts expect Shopify to target larger companies.        In May, Shopify launched a program called Commerce Components. It enables businesses to integrate Shopify's checkout and back-office services with their existing online platforms. Further, toymaker Mattel (MAT) is one early customer.        "Subscription pricing increase that rolled out at the end of April will be a key catalyst supporting topline growth and margins," said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney in a report. "And Shopify continues to drive product innovations, especially for enterprise solutions. Commerce Components offers a lightweight solution for large enterprises without replacing the merchants' whole online infrastructure.",;,; 2023-06-15 05:00:44]
[A fight between fast-food chains and unions in California is over, for now,;,; https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/15/california-fast-food-minimum-wage-deal-what-to-know.html  * From 2025 through 2029, a nine-person council will have the authority to raise the hourly minimum wage annually for affected businesses.  Workers will get at least CPI.  If higher than 3.5% minimum that amount and council will determine pay. * The California minimum wage for fast-food workers is on track to rise to $20 an hour next April. * The pay hike is part of deal between the restaurant industry and labor groups over controversial legislation in California. * Tickers mentioned in article CMG, YUM, QSR, MCD, DPZ, AMZN, TGT, WMT  -----------------  Fast-food workers in California are set to receive pay hikes next year after the restaurant industry and unions reached a compromise over a controversial bill.  The deal, brokered with the help of Gov. Gavin Newsom‚Äôs office, also creates a nine-person council that will decide on future wage hikes for the fast-food industry in California through 2029. The agreement ends a fight between the two sides that threatened to stretch out for years. The restaurant industry was gearing up to spend more than $100 million on the battle.  The deal will mean a wage floor of $20 for California workers at fast-food chains with at least 60 locations nationwide, starting April 1. And from 2025 through 2029, the appointed council will have the authority to raise the hourly minimum wage annually by whichever is lower: 3.5% or the annual change in the consumer price index.  The council will include four representatives from the fast-food industry, four from the workers‚Äô side and one neutral party who will serve as chair.  While fast-food operators will have to cope with paying higher wages, the agreement thwarts more dire consequences, according to industry analysts.  ‚ÄúI certainly wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs catastrophic, and certainly not as bad as it could have played out over the next year or two,‚Äù said Mark Kalinowski, CEO of Kalinowski Equity Research.  California lawmakers rushed to conclude the matter before the legislative session ends midnight Friday. The state senate passed the bill Thursday, and the state assembly has concurred with the upper house‚Äôs amendments. Newsom, a Democrat, has already pledged to sign the bill into law.  **California‚Äôs fast-food fight**  Newsom signed AB 257, also known as the FAST Act, into law in January. The legislation would have created a 10-person council that would govern fast-food chains with more than 60 locations, including setting guidelines for working conditions and wages. The initial wage hike could have been as high as $22 an hour.  But the fast-food industry was attacking the bill before it even made its way to Newsom‚Äôs desk. State records show that Chipotle Mexican Grill, Chick-fil-A, Yum Brands and Restaurant Brands International were among the chains that spent money to lobby California lawmakers to oppose the legislation.  McDonald‚Äôs U.S. President Joe Erlinger wrote a letter posted on the company‚Äôs website, making a rare public statement on a political issue. Erlinger called the bill ‚Äúlopsided‚Äù and ‚Äúill-considered,‚Äù attacking lawmakers for not targeting all restaurants. As of 2022, just under 10% of McDonald‚Äôs U.S. restaurants were located in California, according to Citi Research. Most are run by franchisees.  The restaurant industry retaliated, gathering enough signatures to create a referendum that would make California‚Äôs voters decide on the matter. The Service Employees International Union, which backed the FAST Act, alleged in a lawsuit that the industry misled signatories, but a judge ruled against the union. The referendum was supposed to be on November 2024 ballots.  In response to the referendum, the SEIU backed another bill, AB 1228. The bill would impose joint-employer liability on franchised businesses ‚Äî including the very restaurant chains that loudly decried AB 257.  Under the bill, franchisors like McDonald‚Äôs would be held liable for infractions committed by their franchisees. Opponents said that the bill attacked the very nature of the franchising model. AB 1228‚Ä≤s provisions were originally included in AB 257 but removed before Newsom signed it into law.  The California State Assembly passed AB 1228 in early June. But the state‚Äôs Senate never had the chance to vote on that version.  Instead, the restaurant industry and the unions struck a deal, replacing the joint-employer provisions with the terms of their agreement, which also includes repealing the FAST Act and withdrawing the referendum by Jan. 1.  **What‚Äôs next for workers?**  Fast-food workers employed by affected restaurants will see pay increases of as much as 25% hit their paychecks starting in April. The current California minimum wage is $15.50 an hour, with a bump to $16 set for January.  Employees of smaller fast-food joints and other restaurants could also reap some benefits from the legislation.  ‚ÄúWhen you look at the $20 minimum wage, that‚Äôs a bar that‚Äôs being set,‚Äù Joe Pawlak, managing principal of restaurant consulting firm Technomic, told CNBC. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to make the restaurant industry a lot more competitive for employees, so other industries are going to have to also step up.‚Äù  In recent years, Amazon warehouses and retailers like Walmart and Target have lured workers away with higher hourly pay. Now they‚Äôll be forced to compete with fast-food chains, which have traditionally been slower to raise wages due to operators‚Äô razor-thin margins.  Other states, like Minnesota or New York, could also follow California‚Äôs lead and craft similar councils to govern restaurants or other industries, Pawlak said.  ‚Ä≥[The deal] puts a model in place with a structure that everybody is able to digest,‚Äù he said.  Still, labor‚Äôs side had to make some trade-offs to get the deal in California. One key concession is that the council won‚Äôt have the power to set working conditions. Instead, the Fast Food Council will only be able to recommend proposed standards to state agencies.  But that doesn‚Äôt mean that unions won‚Äôt keep trying to push for better conditions.  ‚ÄúFast-food workers‚Äô fight in California isn‚Äôt close to over ‚Äî it has only just begun as they prepare to take their seat at the table and help transform their industry for the better,‚Äù SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said in a statement to CNBC.  **What does it mean for restaurants?**  Faced with a mandate to pay higher wages, fast-food operators will have to decide how they plan to deal with elevated labor costs. Some may raise menu prices, although customers may balk at having to foot the bill. Others may try to make do with fewer workers on hand or to invest in automation to handle more tasks.  But it‚Äôs not all gloomy for restaurants.  ‚ÄúThis agreement protects local restaurant owners from significant threats that would have made it difficult to continue to operate in California. It provides a more predictable and stable future for restaurants, workers, and consumers,‚Äù Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of public affairs at the National Restaurant Association, said in a statement.  The chief uncertainty resolved by the deal is the referendum slated for November 2024 ballots. The industry had already spent more than $64 million on the referendum, according to California records, and was preparing to spend much more. But it would be difficult to predict which side voters would take.  ‚Ä≥[The agreement] shows just how concerned the industry was,‚Äù Kalinowski said. ‚ÄúThe referendum would have been very challenging, to have it come out their way.‚Äù  On top of that, restaurant chains like In-N-Out now save some cash that otherwise would have gone toward the industry‚Äôs war chest.  The deal also avoids the change to joint-employer liability that was feared by the broader franchising industry.  ‚ÄúThis allows the franchise model to exist,‚Äù said Dana Kravetz, a Los Angeles-based labor attorney at Michelman &amp; Robinson.  Fast-food companies with heavily franchised footprints, like McDonald‚Äôs, KFC, Taco Bell and Domino‚Äôs Pizza, will largely escape the effects of the bill, unless they have company-owned locations in California.  Instead, their franchisees will have to grapple with how to pay higher wages. The National Owners Association, an independent advocacy group of McDonald‚Äôs franchisees, plans to push back. In a memo viewed by CNBC, the NOA projects the bill will cost each restaurant in the state $250,000 annually.  Restaurant companies that don‚Äôt franchise will have to foot the bill for increased labor costs themselves. That includes Chipotle Mexican Grill, which has 457 locations ‚Äî or 14% of its total footprint ‚Äî in its home state of California.,;,; 2023-09-15 17:50:37]
[Started Investing 9/2021 and Finally Break Even,;,; I can't believe that things can turn around so quickly.  I never buy stock prior to September 2021. When inflation was high at that time, I decided to dump all my cash into stock market and thought it would hedge inflation.  I paid for a stock pick service and bought all stocks from their recommendations. I bought SHOP at $1500, UPST, SNOW and ZS at $300, CRWD and DOCU at $280, TTD at $100, TSLA at $800, HUBS at $600, ROKU at $120...  Since 11/2021 the Fed started to crash the market. I kept on DCA, but the more money I added the more I lost. **On 12/31/2022, my loss was around 65% at $800,000.** I was unhappy and mentally stressed the whole time and did not think I can recover the loss one day.  On 2023, my portfolio started to turn around. All the holdings I have through 2021-2022 are 2X to 4X from the bottom. **Recently both my realized and unrealized gain/loss are finally positive with a whopping +219% gain TYD**.  I still cannot believe how quickly it turns around. I feel I am extremely fortunate.  I wrote this post just want to share my feelings with all bag holders. When you feel there is no light at the end of tunnel, don't loss hope and keep adding money to good companies when their prices are down. Your loss will recover one day.  Portfolio and 2-year&amp;YTD charts:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk](https://imgur.com/gallery/kC0YiOk)  **===============================Update on 7/12/2023 =======================**  **1)**  To reply to several comments below about¬†me deserve losing all my money,¬† uneducated, know nothing and is an idiot kid with rich parents, I acknowledge that my initial investment¬†decision and stock selection was very rash and clueless. But such comments and judgements are really not friendly to¬†someone you don't even¬†know in¬†internet . Instead I grew up in a poor family and I am a first generation immigrant here without any relatives in the states. My parents combined are making $1200/month which¬†is highest ever they make.  &amp;#x200B;  **2)** To answer the question about why I hold these stocks:  **UPST**  Pros: Technology is disruptive. Total addressable market is huge. They had two $300+M revenue quarters with positive net income in 2021 when they only had personal loans. Once interest rate goes down and funding constrain is loosen, with their 2 new products car loan and small loan (as well as future new products), the revenue can be $500M quarterly easily. Stock price¬†should be doubled at least if that happens.  Cons: When funding constrain will be loosened is questionable. CEO has poor vision and is indecisive and not trustworthy.  Comments below questioned my oversized position¬†in UPST. I have large position¬†because I bought it at $300 in 2021, then significantly¬†added shares at $150, $40, $17 and $12 to bring down the average cost. This year my broker paid me 22% interest to borrow all UPST shares from me for short sellers. I was happy to collect the interest thus I did not trim any UPST when price went up from bottom. The interest rate they paid me kept dropping like freefall and reached a lowest point at 5% 2 weeks ago because of less short flow. Last week my broker returned all UPST shares to me because no short sellers borrow it any more. I trimmed my shares by 6% the day before I created¬†this post. I will trim it further if price keeps going up but given it is high potential, it will still be my largest position at 15% to 20%¬†  &amp;#x200B;  **SOFI**  I started to follow SOFI this year and after their last impressive ER stock price dropped surprisingly¬†so I started my position at $5s. The following day analyst¬†downgraded SOFI because "personal loans are risky", I doubled my shares at $4s for a total of $60,000 because I thought the downgrade is nonsense. When price went up from there to $10+, multiple analysts downgraded it again with the same reason and so called good-news-already-priced-in. The price dropped by about 10% one day to below $8 in the morning but recovered all loss in the same day! This shows how resistant the price is so i added shares at $8s.¬†  Pros: They increased their revenue by 50% YoY without their largest 2 sources of revenue - student loan and mortgage,¬†compared with pre-COVID. With the significant increased number of users in past 3 years, once student loan and mortgage are back like pre Covid, their revenue will be 5X to 10X. It is expected to achieve net income profitability by Q4 2023.¬† CEO has very good vision (shift focus to personal loans quickly when their main source of income was gone) and is very decisive (when he answered¬†analysts'¬† doubts about persona loans). CEO heavily loading shares at $4 to $6 boosted my¬†confidence¬†in SOFI.  Cons: Hard to give it a fair multiple because there is no comparable companies. Multiple will be low if it is valued as a bank.  &amp;#x200B;  **IT Sector: ZS, CRWD, BILL, NET, IOT, GLBE**  **ZS, CRWD** are pretty stable and the least expensive growth stocks among IT sector, given similar margins among companies in this sector but different scales, growth rates, P/S multiples and FCF trending. In comparison:  Companies like SNOW grow faster but P/S and employee stock compensation are way much higher (I sold out SNOW at $170s)  Companies like NET, MDB and DDOG grow slower yet their P/S are higher (I sold out DDOG at $90s)  Companies like S and IONQ grow much faster but their scales are much smaller ($500M quarterly¬†revenue at $40% growth is more impressive then $100M quarterly revenue at 70% growth) and have indefinite timeline of achieving profitability.  That is why ZS and CRWD win out overall in this sector.  I own **NET** even though it is on the expensive end among IT growth companies because I work for a cyber security company which competes with NET and our management always speak highly of NET  **IOT** is¬†very expensive but they are also very close to profitability and have¬†a¬†large total addressable market. They¬†are the leader in their industry.¬†¬†What makes them different from other IT companies and deserve higher valuation is that the more a customer spend with them, the more the customer may save on their operating expense so it‚Äôs a win-win, thus existing customers will be willing to spend more voluntarily.  **BILL** is another least expensive growth stock in this sector likewise, though their product is nothing innovative and can be easily replicated.  **GLBE**¬†is getting expensive with recent 1-month straight up run regardless Nasdaq is up or down. But I don't know any other player in the market that offers the same product as GLBE  Also if valuation multiples are similar, I prefer tech companies whose existing customers can spend more with increasing usage/units/endpoints/etc (e.g. ZS, CRWD, IOT, SNOW, MDB, SHOP) over companies that sell software at a flat annual price (such as project management or human resource management¬†software e.g. TEAM, ASAN, MNDY, HUBS - I can be wrong on these 4 companies because I simply looked at their products without¬†checking their ER). Of course companies with higher recurring revenue deserve higher premium.  &amp;#x200B;  **Healthcare Sector: TMDX, HIMS**  **TMDX**: product is a game changer - In the past, when a donor donated a live organ, the organ had to be stored in a freezer and is good for only a few hours, thus donor and donee have to be in the same geographical location. TMDX's device mirrors human physiology to connect to the organ to keep it alive for much longer period of time, which allows the organ to be transported to a different geographical location.   Their growth rate and valuation are both very high. Their stock price has highest ceiling in next 1-2 years among all my holdings. It‚Äôs the only company that I own will not be impacted by possible incoming economic recession.  **HIMS**: unbelievably cheap. Major concern is regulation (though it has never¬†happened so far). Stock price fell after the last ER because¬†analysts criticized their sales and¬†marketing spending which is non issue to me. Their recurring revenue is 90% so the money they spend in sales and marketing is a good investment to me.  Healthcare sector did not have a run like IT sector so far this year. It is probably¬†a good time to add holdings in healthcare sector.  &amp;#x200B;  **MELI**  A stable yet fast growing company dominating south America e-commence market. Their AD revenue and fintech are growing at a very fast pace. Valuation is very reasonable. PE is high but P/FCF is low.¬†Stock analyst¬†Brain Stoffel has best ERs' coverages in Youtube and his analysis in twitter about this company.  **DIS**  I bought it because Disney brought back old CEO in hope of regrowing stock price. The CEO will do whatever to cut cost so I am willing to hold it for 1 to 2 more ERs  **OPEN**  I bought OPEN after their impressive Q1 2022 ER (the only net income positive quarter so far). It trended down from there because of housing market and is finally on an upward trend this year with higher and higher margin month over month. Stock price is 5X this year. Twitter account "operdoor2" has OPEN's real time sales and margin data.  &amp;#x200B;  Other holdings I have are big names that everyone know about what they do so I will not dig into them: **TSLA, AMD, ENPH, UNH, AMZN**  &amp;#x200B;  **3)** To answer if I do options, day trade, swing trade and what helped my recover.  I do not do options. I rarely swing trade in 2021-2022 because almost all my holdings were red. I started swing trading several transactions¬†per week this year. This helped me quite a bit to recover my loss.  Just to give a few examples:  I sold $80,000 ZS (and still has $110,000) 2 days ago on Monday (the day before I created this post on Tuesday) when ZS was up 7% on that day to $155 for no news. In the meantime, MELI was down 15% in 2 days because of an analyst‚Äôs downgrade (the reason in the downgrade is really a minor issue). This is a 22% (15+7=22) swing so I trimmed ZS and doubled my MELI shares. As of today Wednesday, all shares I added to MELI on¬†Monday are green.  Today ZS is down by nearly 15% to $130s from¬† $155¬†just 2 days ago because of the news about Microsoft being close to release a product to compete with ZS, I added 100 shares ZS today while most of my other holdings are green as I don't think it is that easy and quick for MS to have any impact on ZS.  Why I had such large percentage of positions nearly $200,000 in ZS prior to the trimming on Monday? It‚Äôs not because I have higher conviction on it over other IT stocks I own, it‚Äôs because from 2/15 to 5/1 this year, ZS dropped from $140s to $85 and kept on hitting a new 2-year low over and over again and was significantly underperformed than any other tech growth¬†stocks I own or watch during that 2.5 month span (e.g. CRWD¬†price was $120 in both 2/15 and 5/1). I kept adding shares to ZS on its way down especially heavily at $87 and $85 on around 5/1. My total shares of ZS is more than tripled after that. Fast forward to this week, I trimmed 40% of shares at $150s. So when you own 15 growth sticks, you can compare their weekly, monthly and 3-month charts and choose the worst performed stocks to DCA if there is no major company specific bad news. This turns out well for me.   Yesterday right before I created this post, I sold out my UBER position for profit taking¬†(UBER will be a cash cow BTW so I am looking to add it back when price pulls back) and¬†increased my shares of TSLA¬†and AMD when both of them had 2 red days in a row¬†¬†this Monday and Tuesday while all my other growth stocks performed very well in these 2 days.¬†To answer one of the comment below about my cost basis of AMD and TSLA being high - It is because in the past one month I sold 2/3 of my AMD and TSLA¬†shares at near recent peak at $130s and $270s respectively for 30% profit taking and added them back when their prices had 5% to 15% pull back.  Whenever there is an analyst downgrade, more often than not, I feel it is because institute¬†buyers want to load up their shares so they hammer the stock price as low as possible prior to buying. If the reason for downgrading is nonsense or minor, or are repeat downgrades using the same reasons,¬† I add shares. This works very well for me so far. After UPST was down to $40 last year, analysts used same reasons to repeatedly downgraded it for 9 months all the way down to $12, I loaded up shares at $40, $17 and $12. Fast forward to today it‚Äôs $44.  Also post ER¬†overreaction is a good time to add shares. I follow ABNB's last 5 ERs and their price always dropped after ER even though every ER was great (The explanation of the drop is that high valuation¬†stocks' ER need significant beat rather than just moderate beat). ABNB stock price awalys recovered in 1-3 weeks after post ER drop. This happens every single time. I sold out $60,000+ ABNB last week with 20%-25% gain when it reached $130s. Same for CRWD¬†last ER, it was perfect but price dropped 10% post ER, I added shares post ER and price recovered to pre ER level in 2 days.¬† And SOFI last ER too, it recovered the post ER and downgrade price drop to raise from $4s back to $6 within 2-3 weeks (as I mentioned earlier, I opened my position of SOFI for a total of $60,000 at $5s and $4s within 24 hours post ER and downgrade)¬†¬†  So in short, swing trade and rebalancing  (from short term winner to looser) helped me so far.  Of course it is the microeconomy that drove the recovery primarily, but rebalancing and adding shares after post ER overreaction and nonsense downgrade contribute to probably 20% to 30% of my recovery.,;,; 2023-07-11 20:51:57]
[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 24th, 2023,;,; Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 24th, 2023.  # **Stocks end Friday‚Äôs session little changed, Dow snaps 4-week win streak: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/20/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)** ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended little changed Friday and finished lower for the week as investors evaluated the latest earnings results and concerns of disappointing profits. ***** &gt; The 30-stock index added 22.34 points, or 0.07%, to end at 33,808.96, while the S&amp;P 500 eked out a 0.09% gain to settle at 4,133.52. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.11% to close at 12,072.46. ***** &gt; All major indices finished the week in the red, with the Dow falling 0.23% to snap a four-week win streak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq saw the biggest decline, falling 0.42%, while the S&amp;P slipped 0.1%. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the continued push-pull of the fact that the economy has been a lot more resilient than many people expected and corporate earnings have held up pretty well, all things considered,‚Äù said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. ***** &gt; Even so, he noted that the Federal Reserve has raised rates substantially over the last year. Zaccarelli said that even if the central bank hikes as anticipated in May, it will likely hold rates at a higher level than the market expects. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúYou can kind of see the the bull and bear case really right there in a nutshell as far as resilient economy with stronger-than-expected corporate earnings versus a very hot, very restrictive monetary policy coming from the Fed,‚Äù he said. ***** &gt; Earnings season continued Friday, with results from Procter &amp; Gamble. The consumer products company gained 3.5% after beating expectations and lifting it sales forecast. As of Friday morning, 76% of S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings so far have beaten analyst EPS estimates, according to FactSet. ***** &gt; Elsewhere, materials stocks were the worst performers, with Freeport-McMoRan falling 4.1%. Albemarle tumbled 10% as Chile said it would nationalize its lithium industry. ***** &gt; While companies broadly beat expectations this week, overall profit reports failed to boost stocks, with some investors fearing an earnings drop looms with a likely recession ahead. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúSo far, earnings season is off to an uneventful start, with many companies meeting already reduced earnings expectations and that helps to explain the lack of movement in the major stock indices over the past few days,‚Äù said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, adding that she expects stocks to trade in a tight range for some time. ***** &gt; Earnings continue next week with results on deck from Big Tech companies Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft.  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/X80CMcG.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/2sXCFPp.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/6UXdyyt.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/HeS3rk3.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/g7rVv6a.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LtSkkqz.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/yQ3Msa8.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nhTH81a.png))**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/trf5gkX.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/HOShbKh.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fJRFTJ8.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/PfOt4BN.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/d6UNrjj.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/ZfzSKpV.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Ii3RcFW.png))**   *****  &gt; # Lithium: The Cycle Continues  &gt; If you haven't checked the price of lithium lately, you might be in for a surprise. Spot prices for lithium carbonate in China have collapsed by two-thirds since hitting record highs in November of last year. Prices have gone from $84k per ton to $25k per ton. That unwinds the vast majority of a spectacular surge that played out from 2020 to 2022. Lithium initially surged 1,279% from July 2020 to March 2022 as part of the broader explosion of commodity prices and booming demand for electric vehicles, eventually peaking up 1,387% from the post-COVID lows. It's easy to forget that this critical battery input had already gone through one such cycle. A 224% rally in 6 months during late 2015 and early 2016 before a long, slow bear market that saw prices down 78% over several years.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/042123-Lithium-1.png))**  &gt; In the equity market, the price cycle hasn't been as dramatic in percentage terms, but there has still nonetheless been a double cycle of surging stock prices in 2016 followed by a grinding bear market, and then an even more dramatic surge through late 2022 that is now sliding into reverse. On Thursday, Chile's government announced reforms to its lithium extraction policy. While existing contracts with firms that operate in the rich lithium brine deposits of the Chilean Atacama desert will be honored, the market is looking at weaker lithium prices and the fact that existing contracts will be replaced by less favorable ones 10+ years down the line and hitting lithium players. SQM is off 21% today while ALB is 10% lower.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/042123-Lithium-2.png))**  *****  &gt; # April 2nd Half Strength After Tax Deadline  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/afa92ac85fc99643437fa5847f722d56/0e5336993d97da50-d7/s500x750/141da6a316fe62016dc5b44732a14607f4c27019.jpg))**  &gt; 1st half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has not been the case. Traders are more focused on Q1 earnings and guidance during April than the Tax Deadline nowadays.  &gt; Expectations are low for earnings season and next week is a big week with 35% of S&amp;P 500 stocks reporting next week including AMZN, GOOGL, META &amp; MSFT, compared to less than 12% this week and 2% last week (Hat tip @ScottSchnipper @CNBC @CNBCPro). Better than expected results and upbeat guidance could rally stocks into month-end.  &gt; These 2 charts show how April is tracking usual performance over the last 21 years as well as during pre-election years. April is clearly weaker than normal, yet the market is still tracking the directional trends.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9891a2da9b4d408133b986892263f446/0e5336993d97da50-20/s500x750/bb0e2c55fd3110169aa2d9addbe34683f918d2b7.jpg))**    *****  &gt; # Jobless Claims Nearing New Highs  &gt; Jobless claims have continued to weaken with this week's release, rising by 5K to 245K versus expectations of no change from last week's upwardly revised 240K print. At current levels, claims sit at the high end of the range since the start of 2022 and only a couple thousand below last month's high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/042023-Claims-1.png))**  &gt; Prior to seasonal adjustment, claims have essentially come in right inline with the reading for the same week last year and the few years prior to the pandemic. As shown in the second chart below, claims tend to experience a little bit of a bounce around this point of the year before resuming a move lower through the late spring.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/042023-Claims-2.png))**  &gt; Continuing claims were equally disappointing this week rising to 1.865 million, 40K above expectations. Although the increase to initial claims has not resulted in a new high, the 61K increase for continuing claims leaves the indicator at the highest level since late November 2021.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/042023-Claims-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # Homebuilders Breaking Out Like It's...  &gt; It's hard to get over how well the homebuilder stocks have been performing lately. As shown in the charts below of stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 Homebuilder group, these names are nearly universally in steep six-month uptrends and breaking out as we type.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/builders1.png))** &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/builders2.png))**  &gt; Below is another way to see just how crazy the run has been for the S&amp;P 1500 Homebuilder stocks lately. Most names are now up 30-40% year-to-date after rallying 5-10% over the last week. This has pushed them ~10% above their 50-DMAs, and many are trading more than two (or even three for some) standard deviations above their 50-DMAs in extreme overbought territory.  &gt; "Mr. Market" has either lost its mind or it's predicting that all the current worries about housing in the months and quarters ahead are misguided.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/buildersuse.png))**  *****  &gt; # Sell in May and go away ‚Äì Maybe, it depends  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/AIN_0523_20230413_4-yr_cycle_worst_months_table.jpg))**  &gt; In the above table the ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù performance of DJIA, S&amp;P 500, and NASDAQ have been separated by year of the four-year-presidential-election cycle going back to 1951 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 and 1971 for NASDAQ. NASDAQ‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù are July through October compared to May to October for DJIA and S&amp;P 500. Even though pre-election years have historically been the best performing year of the four-year cycle, performance during the ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù has not been the least bit impressive. In 18 pre-election year ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù periods, DJIA has averaged a meager 1.14%. S&amp;P 500 is only slightly better +1.81% while NASDAQ‚Äôs average is under 1%. Frequency of gains or percentage of time higher in pre-election years ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù is only slightly better than 50-50.  &gt; Because of the elevated level of risk that has been historically observed during the ‚ÄúWorst Six Months‚Äù of the year and its historically tepid returns, reducing long exposure and developing a defensive strategy is the approach taken in the Almanac Investor Stock and ETF Portfolios. We do not merely ‚Äúsell in May and go away.‚Äù Instead, we take some profits, trim or outright sell underperforming stock and ETF positions, tighten stop losses and limit adding new long exposure to positions from sectors that have a demonstrated a record of outperforming during the ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù period.  &gt; For those with a lower risk tolerance or a desire to take a break from trading, the ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù are a great opportunity to unwind some longs and move into the relative safety of cash, Treasury bonds, gold and/or some combination of traditional defensive assets. For the first time in over a decade, cash can currently earn something other than zero. Preservation of capital may be more important than growth and with historical averages and frequency of gains reduced; the ‚ÄúWorst Six Months‚Äù are a good time to simply step aside if you prefer. August, September and/or October have provided some excellent buying opportunities over the years and could do the same again this year.  *****  &gt; # Sector Breadth All Over the Place  &gt; In terms of price, the Industrials sector remains 5.75% below its high from January of last year and has yet to even take out the highs from earlier this year, but breadth has been more constructive recently. Just yesterday, the cumulative advance/decline line hit a new all time high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041823-Sectors-1.png))**  &gt; Although that measure of breadth is making promising moves, other breadth measures have not exactly echoed that strength. In spite of the record high in the cumulative A/D line Monday, only 37% of the sector's stocks finished above their 50-DMAs. As shown below, of all other instances of a record high in the cumulative AD line, there has never been such a low reading in the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs. In fact, no other readings have even crossed into the 30% range! For the vast majority of previous highs, the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs has sat at 70% or more.   &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041823-Sectors-2a.png))**  &gt; All that is to say that most Industrials sector stocks are moving higher, but have not yet moved above potential resistance at their 50-DMAs. And even though the reading on the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs is low at the moment, that is not to say it is not improving rapidly. As shown below, it has risen sharply from the low of 19.18% on April 6th. Furthermore, whereas Monday's close only saw 37% of the sector finish above their 50-DMAs, as of mid-morning Tuesday the reading is already up another 8.2 percentage points to 45.2% as the average stock in the sector trades just 7 bps below its 50-DMA.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/04/041823-Sectors-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # Volatility Is The Toll We Pay  &gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a proprietary strategy. I can‚Äôt go into it in great detail.‚Äù ‚Äì Bernie Madoff  &gt; Although Bernie Madoff was quite vague when asked how he had a strategy that printed money month after month when no one else could match it, as investors we know one thing and that is markets don‚Äôt always go straight up.  &gt; Burt White, our Managing Director and Chief Strategy Officer, likes to say that volatility is the toll we pay to invest. No one wants to pay a toll, but sometimes you just have to do it to get where you are going. When I lived in Charlotte and would drive back up to Ohio for holidays, I‚Äôd have to pay the great state of West Virginia $4.25 three different times on I-77. I didn‚Äôt like it, but Santa brought the kids presents up there and I had to do it.  &gt; Getting back to the stock market, volatility is that toll that we pay for enjoying longer-term returns. Below is a great chart that sums it up and thanks to our friends at Ned Davis Research for helping us with the data.  &gt; Here‚Äôs what you need to know regarding the S&amp;P 500:  &gt; Each year sees more than seven different 3% percent dips. More than three times a year do stocks correct 5%. About once a year on average sees a 10% correction. A 15% major correction happens every year-and-a-half. A 20% bear markets happens about every three years.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/blog-1-1-800x301.png))**  &gt; Another quote I like is from Regis Philbin when he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm involved in the stock market, which is fun, but sometimes very painful.‚Äù Well, this year has been fun for investors, but last year was quite painful.  &gt; After more than a 120% rally off the March 2020 lows, maybe the bear market we saw last year shouldn‚Äôt have caught as many investors off guard like it did? We didn‚Äôt quite see a 25% bear market happening last year, but we expected as much as a 15% correction at some point. With the historically aggressive Fed, inflation soaring, China lockdowns, the war, and supply chains in disarray, it was a perfect cocktail for a bear market.  &gt; The truth though is we get spoiled by the good times and when the rough times hit, we are almost surprised that bad times ever happen.

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023,;,; Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023.  # **Stocks close higher Friday as investors try to shake off latest bank fears: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/stock-futures-are-up-slightly-as-investors-weigh-bank-troubles-fed-decision.html)** ***** &gt; Stocks rose Friday, reversing their earlier session declines as Deutsche Bank shares pared back some losses. ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 132.28 points, or 0.41%, closing at 32,238.15. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.57%, while Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.3%. The major indexes all had a winning week, with the Dow gaining 0.4% week-to-date as of Friday afternoon, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq gained 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively. ***** &gt; Deutsche Bank‚Äôs U.S.-listed shares slid 3.11% Friday, rebounding from a 7% drop earlier in the trading session. A selloff of shares was triggered after the the German lender‚Äôs credit default swaps jumped, but without an apparent catalyst. The move appeared to raise concerns once again over the health of the European banking industry. Earlier this month, Swiss regulators forced a UBS acquisition of rival Credit Suisse. Deutsche Bank shares traded off their worst levels of the session, which caused major U.S. indexes to also cut their losses. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think that the market overall is neither frightened nor optimistic ‚Äî it‚Äôs simply confused,‚Äù said George Ball, president at Sanders Morris Harris. ‚ÄúThe price action for the last month-and-a-half, including today, is a jumble without any direction or conviction.‚Äù ***** &gt; Ball added that Deutsche Bank is ‚Äúvery sound financially.‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIt could be crippled if there‚Äôs a big loss of confidence and there‚Äôs a run on the bank. There is, however, no fundamental reason why that should occur, other than nervousness.‚Äù ***** &gt; European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde tried to ease concerns, saying euro zone banks are resilient with strong capital and liquidity positions. Lagarde said the ECB could provide liquidity if needed. ***** &gt; Investors continued to assess the Fed‚Äôs latest policy move announced this week. The central bank hiked rates by a quarter-point. However, it also hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be ending soon. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that credit conditions have tightened, which could put pressure on the economy. ***** &gt; On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said regulators are prepared to take more action if needed to stabilize U.S. banks. Her comments are the latest among regulators attempting to buoy confidence in the U.S. banking system in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank closures. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúRetail [and] institutional investors are both looking at the banking system, but now internationally. That‚Äôs dangerous,‚Äù Ball added. ‚ÄúBanks exist because of confidence in their stability, and that confidence can be eroded as we now see, via social media and technology in a matter of minutes.‚Äù  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kYFZ0mb.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/sa1yxWq.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/QsHW7no.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/OGQZBeP.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/uIef67v.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kr3YfHV.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JiYUEBP.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CKcDnul.png))**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vsFHgKf.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mconM20.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H7KFVcz.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ymKQozZ.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TsJcX1J.png))**   *****  &gt; # Best and Worst Stocks Since the COVID Crash Low  &gt; We are now three years out from the COVID Crash low, and even with the past year's weakness, most assets continue to sit on solid gains. For major US index ETFs, the S&amp;P Midcap 400 (IJH) is up the most having slightly more than doubled while the S&amp;P Smallcap 600 (IJR) is not far behind having rallied 95.9%. Value has generally outperformed growth, especially for mid and small-caps although that has shifted somewhat this year. For example, while its gains have been more middling since the COVID crash, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has been the strongest area of the equity market in 2023 thanks to the strength of sectors like Tech (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC). Although those sectors have posted strong gains this year, they have been the weakest over the past three years while Energy (XLE) far and away has been the strongest asset class. Paired with the strength of energy stocks has been solid runs in commodities (DBC)more broadly with the notable exception being Natural Gas (UNG) which has lost over 40%. Bond ETFs are similarly sitting on losses since the COVID Crash lows. As for international markets, Mexico (EWW) and India (PIN) have outpaced the rest of the world although Emerging Markets (EEM) as a whole have not been particularly strong; likely being dragged on by the weaker performance of China (ASHR) which holds a large weight on EEM.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low.png))**  &gt; Taking a look at current S&amp;P 500 members, nearly half of the index has more than doubled over the past three years. As for the absolute best performers, Energy stocks dominate the list with four of the top five best-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks coming from that sector. Targa Resources (TRGP) has been the absolute best performer with a nearly 900% total return. Other notables include a couple of heavy weight stocks: Tesla (TSLA) and NVIDIA (NVDA) with gains of 563.9% and 412.9%, respectively.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low-2.png))**  &gt; On the other end of the spectrum, there are currently 25 stocks that have posted a negative return since the COVID Crash low. The worst has been First Republic Bank (FRC) which has been more of a recent development. Whereas today the stock has posted an 83.1% loss, at the start of this month it would have been a 65% gain. Another standout on the list of worst performers has been Amazon (AMZN). Most other mega caps have more than doubled since the March 2020 S&amp;P 500 low, however, the e-commerce giant has hardly offered a positive return.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # Sector Performance Experiences a Historical Divergence  &gt; The first quarter of 2023 is coming to a close next week, and checking in on year to date performance, there has been a big divergence between the winners and losers. Although the S&amp;P 500 is up 2.84% on the year as of yesterday's close, only three of the eleven sectors are higher. Not only are those three sectors up on the year, but they have posted impressive double digit gains only three months into the year. Of those three, Consumer Discretionary has posted the smallest gain of 10% whereas Technology and Communication Services have risen 17.2% and 18.1%, respectively. The fact that these sectors are home to the main mega cap stocks -- like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have been on an impressive run of late -- helps to explain how the market cap weighted S&amp;P 500 is up on the year without much in the way of healthy breadth on a sector level.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-1a.png))**  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-1.png))**  &gt; One thing that is particularly remarkable about this year's sector performance is just how rare it is for a sector to be up 10%+ (let alone 3) while all other sectors are lower. And that is for any point of the year let alone in the first quarter. As we mentioned in yesterday's Sector Snapshot and show in the charts below, going back to 1990, there have only been two other periods in which a sector has risen at least 10% YTD while all other sectors were lower YTD. The first of those was in May 2009. In a similar instance to now, Consumer Discretionary, Tech, and Materials were the three sectors with double digit gains back then. With those sectors up solidly, the S&amp;P 500 was little changed on the year with a less than 1% gain. As you can see below, though, by the end of 2009, every sector had pushed into positive territory as the new bull market coming out of the global financial crisis was well underway.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-2.png))**  &gt; The next occurrence was much more recent: 2022. Obviously, it was a tough year for equities except for the Energy sector which had a banner year. Throughout most of the year, the sector traded up by well over 20% year to date even while the rest of the equity market was battered.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # The Fed Expects Banking Stress to Substitute for Rate Hikes  &gt; The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 0.25% at their March meeting, bringing it to the 4.75-5.0% range. This is the ninth-straight rate increase and brings rates to their highest level since 2007. However, the most aggressive tightening cycle since the early 1980s, which saw them lift rates all the way from near zero to almost 5%, is near its end.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-target-rate-601x800.png))**  &gt; Up until early February, Fed officials expected to raise rates to a maximum of about 5.1% and hold it there for a while. However, since that time, we‚Äôve gotten a slew of strong economic data, including elevated inflation numbers. This pushed fed officials to give ‚Äúguidance‚Äù that they expected to raise rates by more than they estimated back in December.  &gt; Market expectations for policy also moved in conjunction. Prior to February, markets expected the Fed to raise rates to 5% by June, and subsequently lower them by about 0.5% by the end of the year. But strong incoming data and Fed guidance pushed expectations higher, with the terminal rate moving up to 5.6% and no cuts in 2023.  &gt; # The Silicon Valley Bank crisis changed everything &gt; The bank crisis that erupted over the last couple of weeks resulted in a significant shift, both in expectations for policy and now the Fed as well. See here for our complete rundown on SVB and the ensuing crisis.  &gt; Market expectations for Fed policy rates immediately moved lower. Markets expected the stress in banks to translate to tighter credit conditions, which in turn would lead to slower economic growth and lower inflation.  &gt; This was nicely articulated by Professor Jeremey Siegel, one of the foremost commentators on financial markets and fed policy, in our latest episode of the Facts vs Feelings podcast, Prof. Siegel said that tighter credit conditions, as lending standards become more strict, are de facto rate hikes.  &gt; Fed Chair Powell more or less said exactly the same thing after the Fed‚Äôs March meeting. The 0.25% increase was an attempt to thread the needle between financial stability and fighting inflation. Fed officials also forecast the fed funds rate to hit a maximum of 5.1%, unchanged from their December estimate. This is a marked shift from what was expected just a few weeks ago, with Powell explicitly saying that tighter credit conditions ‚Äúsubstitute‚Äù for rate hikes.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-rate-expectations-600x800.png))**  &gt; # There‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty ahead &gt; While the recent bank stresses are expected to tighten credit conditions and thereby impact economic growth and inflation, there are a couple of open questions:  &gt; * How big will the impact be?  &gt; * How long will the impact last?  &gt; These are unknown currently. Which means future policy is also unknown.  &gt; Fed officials expect to take rates to 5.1%, i.e., one more rate increase. And then expect to hold it there through the end of the year. In short, they don‚Äôt expect rate cuts this year.  &gt; Yet investors expect no more rate increases and about 0.6% of rate cuts in the second half of 2023. Markets expect the policy rate in June to be at 4.8%, while expectations for December are at 4.2%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-implied-policy-rate-differential-600x800.png))**  &gt; There‚Äôs clearly a huge gulf between what the Fed expects versus what investors expect. This will have to reconcile in one of two ways:  &gt; * Market expectations move higher ‚Äì if economic/inflation data remain strong and credit conditions don‚Äôt look to be tightening significantly.  &gt; * Fed expectations move lower ‚Äì if the banking sector comes under renewed stress, credit conditions could tighten significantly and eventually lead to weaker data.  &gt; Things are obviously not going to go in either direction in a straight line. It‚Äôs going to be a bumpy ride as new data points come in, not to mention news/rumors of renewed problems in the banking sector.  *****  &gt; # Seasonality Keeps Claims Below 200K?  &gt; Initial jobless claims remained healthy this week with another sub-200K print. Claims fell modestly to 191K from last week's unrevised reading of 192K. That small decline exceeded expectations of claims rising up to 197K. Given claims continue to impress, the seasonally adjusted number has come in below 200K for 9 of the last 10 weeks. By that measure, it has been the strongest stretch for claims since last April when there were 10 weeks in a row of sub-200K prints. Prior to that, from 2018 through 2020 the late March and early April period similarly saw consistent readings under 200K meaning that some of the strength in the adjusted number could be on account of residual seasonality.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-1.png))**  &gt; In fact, this point of the year has some of the weeks in which claims have the most consistently historically fallen week over week. Taking a historical median of claims throughout the year, claims tend to round out a short-term bottom in the spring before an early summer bump. In other words, seasonal strength will begin to wane in the coming months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-2.png))**  &gt; While initial claims improved, continuing claims worsened rising to 1.694 million from 1.68 million the previous week. Albeit higher, that remains below the 2023 high of 1.715 million set at the end of February.  *****  &gt; # A Fed Day Like Most Others  &gt; Yesterday's Fed decision and comments from Fed Chair Powell gave markets plenty to chew on. As we discussed in last night's Closer and today's Morning Lineup, there have been a number of conflicting statements from officials and confusing reactions in various assets over the past 24 hours. In spite of all that uncertainty, the S&amp;P 500's path yesterday pretty much followed the usual script. In the charts below we show the S&amp;P's average intraday pattern across all Fed days since Powell has been chair (first chart) and the intraday chart of the S&amp;P yesterday (second chart). As shown, the market's pattern yesterday, especially after the 2 PM ET rate decision and the 2:30 PM press conference, closely resembled the average path that the market has followed across all Powell Fed Days since 2018.  &gt; The S&amp;P saw a modest bounce after the 2 PM Fed decision and then a further rally right after Powell's presser began at 2:30 PM. That initial post-presser spike proved to be a pump-fake, as markets ultimately sold off hard with a near 2% decline from 2:30 PM to the 4 PM close.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-1a.png))**  &gt; So what typically happens in the week after Fed days? Since 1994 when the Fed began announcing policy decisions on the same day as its meeting, the S&amp;P has averaged a decline of 10 basis points over the next week. During the current tightening cycle that began about a year ago, market performance in the week after Fed days has been even worse with the S&amp;P averaging a decline of 0.99%. However, when the S&amp;P has been down over 1% on Fed days (like yesterday), performance over the next week has been positive with an average gain of 0.64%. As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-3.png))**  *****   &gt; # What Now? An Update on Recent Bank Stress.  &gt; It‚Äôs been less than 2 weeks since Silicon Valley Bank‚Äôs stunning 48-hour collapse, and a few more banks have been caught in the fray. New York regulators closed the doors on Signature Bank on Sunday, March 12. A week later, US banks injected $30 billion into First Republic Bank to keep it afloat, and UBS acquired rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse in a government-brokered deal. In the midst of the chaos, your Carson Investment Research team was there for you with client-facing content, professional advice, and investment solutions. In fact, we think this event presents an opportunity to invest in the more stable large-cap financial companies and recently upgraded the sector to overweight in our House Views Advice.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mar22_1-1600x927.png))**  &gt; # Why is this happening? &gt; The rapid hike in interest rates caused an asset and liability mismatch for banks. Due to many years of low-interest rates, banks invested assets in interest-earning loans and bonds that would be repaid over the next five-plus years, which at the time was a logical way to earn a higher yield. Regulators considered government bonds to be among the safest ways a bank could invest its capital. As interest rates rose, bond values dropped. Interest rates rose at the fastest pace in history, and the safe assets that banks invested in lost value to the tune of more than $620 billion in unrealized losses as of the end of last year. This decline in value left weaker banks underwater and, when coupled with depositors pulling money out, caused them to collapse or seek costly capital raises.  &gt; # Why this matters to investors? &gt; The weakness in the banking sector will likely lead to tighter lending standards, potentially slowing economic growth. The reason we‚Äôre in this mess, to begin with, is that the Fed hiked interest rates to slow the economy because inflation was rising too quickly. Perhaps the 16% drop in oil prices over the past two weeks reflected this slower growth and bodes well for continued falling inflation. Thus, the Fed is closer to achieving its goal.  &gt; Maybe it‚Äôs an overreaction as ‚Äúbanking crisis‚Äù headlines stir painful memories of 2008. Either way, an environment with slower growth and lower inflation isn‚Äôt a bad time to invest. Bonds and stocks could both perform well, especially stocks of companies with the ability to grow earnings. We also reiterate our House Views Advice overweight on the large-cap Financials sector. The largest US banks are well-capitalized and are gaining market share from the smaller regional banks. We believe this calamity provides an opportunity for stronger banks and investors to capitalize on.  *****  &gt; # FANG+ Flying  &gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup, sector performance has heavily favored areas like Tech, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services in recent weeks. Playing into that sector level performance has been the strength of the mega-caps. The NYSE FANG+ index tracks ten of the largest and most highly traded Tech and Tech-adjacent names. In the past several days, that cohort of stocks is breaking out to the highest level since last April whereas the S&amp;P 500 still needs to rally 4% to reach its February high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-1.png))**  &gt; Although FANG+ stocks have been strong recently, that follows more than a full year of underperformance. As shown below, relative to the S&amp;P 500, mega-cap Tech consistently underperformed from February 2021 through this past fall. In the past few days, the massive outperformance has resulted in a breakout of the downtrend for the ratio of FANG+ to the S&amp;P 500.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-2.png))**  &gt; More impressive is how rapid of a move it has been for that ratio to break out. Below, we show the 2-month percent change in the ratio above. As of the high at yesterday's close, the ratio had risen 22.5% over the prior two months. That comes up just short of the record (22.6%) leading up to the pre-COVID high in February 2020. In other words, mega-cap Tech has experienced near-record outperformance relative to the broader market. However, we would note that this is in the wake of last year when the group had seen some of its worst two-month underperformance on record with the worst readings being in March, May, and November.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # March Seasonality Prevails, Banking Fiasco Be Damned  &gt; It‚Äôs encouraging typical March seasonal patterns have overcome recent bank failures, recession talk and fearmongering. The early March pullback was steeper than normal, but the usual mid-month rebound appears to be materializing.  &gt; Last week‚Äôs gains could be an indication we have seen the worst of the banking fallout and the end of the pullback. Triple Witching Weeks have tended to be down in flat periods and dramatically so during bear markets. Positive March Triple Witching weeks in 2003 and 2009 confirmed the market was back in rally mode.  &gt; The week after March Triple Witching is notoriously nasty. S&amp;P is down 27 of the last 40 year ‚Äì and frequently down sharply. Positive or flat action this week would be constructive.  &gt; In the old days March used to come in like a bull and out like a bear. Nowadays March has evolved into an inflection point where short-term trends often change course. The market is clearly at an important juncture and it‚Äôs a good time to remember Warren Buffet‚Äôs wise words to ‚ÄúBe greedy when others are fearful.‚Äù  &gt; Bank failures are never a good thing, but the swift actions of regulators likely prevented further damage to the industry. At the least, the banks are likely to be under even greater scrutiny going forward. In the near-term we expect more volatile trading. Further out we expect the market, and the economy will recover like they both have historically done.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5fe6f3377343f819ff93c97e8aeb8ffc/1258a39f06bd18c7-63/s500x750/303b38d927e1a424f5dc254dd086678978f2cc12.jpg))**  *****  &gt; # Nasdaq Leaves the S&amp;P in the Dust  &gt; Looking at the major US index ETF screen of our Trend Analyzer shows just how disconnected the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has become from other major index ETFs recently. As shown below, as of Friday's close, QQQ actually finished in overbought territory (over 1 standard above its 50-DMA) whereas many other major index ETFs were oversold, some of those to an extreme degree. On a year to date basis, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has rallied more than 14% compared to low single digit gains or losses for the rest of the pack.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/usindexqqq.png))**  &gt; Historically, the major indices, namely the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, tend to trade at similar overbought and oversold levels. In the chart below we show the Nasdaq 100 and S&amp;P 500's distance from their 50-DMAs (expressed in standard deviations) over the past five years. As shown, typically the two large cap indices have seen similar albeit not identical readings. That is until the past few weeks in which the two have diverged more significantly.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**  &gt; On Friday there was more than 2 standard deviations between the Nasdaq's overbought 50-DMA spread and the S&amp;P 500's oversold spread. As shown in the chart below, that surpassed recent highs in the spread like the spring of 2020 to set the highest reading since October 2016.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**  &gt; Going back to 1985, the spread between the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 50-DMA spreads diverging to such a degree is not without precedent, but it is also not exactly common.

[Amazon to lay off 9,000 more workers after earlier cuts,;,; https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/20/amazon-layoffs-company-to-cut-off-9000-more-workers.html  Amazon will lay off 9,000 more employees in the coming weeks, CEO Andy Jassy said in a memo to staff on Monday.  The cuts are on top of the previously announced layoffs that began in November and extended into January. That round affected more than 18,000 employees.  Amazon made the decision to lay off more employees as it looks to streamline costs and took into account the uncertain economy, as well as the ‚Äúuncertainty that exists in the near future,‚Äù Jassy said. The company just wrapped up the second phase of its annual budgeting process, referred to internally as ‚ÄúOP2.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers‚Äô lives and Amazon as a whole,‚Äù Jassy said.  The latest round will primarily impact Amazon‚Äôs cloud computing, human resources, advertising and Twitch livestreaming businesses, Jassy said in the memo.,;,; 2023-03-20 14:56:39]
[FTC readies lawsuit that could break up Amazon,;,; The Federal Trade Commission is finalizing its long-awaited antitrust lawsuit against Amazon, four people with knowledge of the matter told POLITICO, a move that could ultimately break up parts of the company.  The FTC has been investigating the company on a number of fronts, and the coming case would be one of the most aggressive and high-profile moves in the Biden administration‚Äôs rocky effort to tame the power of tech giants. The wide-ranging lawsuit is expected as soon as August, and will likely challenge a host of Amazon‚Äôs business practices, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential matter. If successful, it could lead to a court-ordered restructuring of the $1.3 trillion empire and define the legacy of FTC Chair Lina Khan.  Khan rose to prominence as a Big Tech skeptic with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in. Because any case will likely take years to wind through the courts, the final result will rest with her successors. The exact details of the final lawsuit are not known, and changes to the final complaint are expected until the eleventh hour. But personnel throughout the agency, including Khan herself, have homed in on several of Amazon‚Äôs business practices, said some of the people.  The complaint is likely to focus on challenges to Amazon Prime, Amazon rules that the FTC says block lower prices on competing websites, and policies the FTC believes force merchants to use Amazon‚Äôs logistics and advertising services, according to some of the people.  The agency has been drafting a complaint since at least the end of last year, some of the people said, and is likely to file its case in federal court rather than its in-house tribunal.  In its probe, the FTC has interviewed dozens of witnesses both inside and outside Amazon, including CEO Andy Jassy and former CEO and founder Jeff Bezos, some of the people said. The FTC has collected millions of documents from Amazon and third parties over the last three years to build its case.

[Amazon Is in Talks to Offer Free Mobile Service to US Prime Members,;,; https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-talks-offer-free-mobile-123703089.html  Amazon.com Inc. has been talking with wireless carriers about offering low-cost or possibly free nationwide mobile phone service to Prime subscribers, according to people familiar with the situation. The company is negotiating with Verizon Communications Inc., T-Mobile US Inc. and Dish Network Corp. to get the lowest possible wholesale prices. That would let it offer Prime members wireless plans for $10 a month or possibly for free and bolster loyalty among its biggest spending customers, the people said, who requested anonymity to discuss a private matter.  The talks have been going on for six to eight weeks and have also included AT&amp;T Inc. at times, but the plan may take several more months to launch and could be scrapped, one person said. Dish shares jumped 14% Friday in New York since a deal with the retail giant could help the struggling satellite-TV company as it transitions to become a national wireless carrier. Meanwhile, T-Mobile fell 8.4%, AT&amp;T dropped 5% and Verizon slid 3.5.%. The big three national carriers could see their own subscribers flee to a cheaper option at Amazon. Deutsche Telekom AG, which holds a majority stake in T-Mobile, fell 5.7% in Germany. ‚ÄúWe are always exploring adding even more benefits for Prime members, but don‚Äôt have plans to add wireless at this time,‚Äù Amazon spokesperson Maggie Sivon said in a statement. Verizon and Dish declined to comment.  Amazon‚Äôs US Prime subscribers pay $139 a year for privileges like speedy free delivery, video streaming and access to 100 million songs. Analysts say Prime membership has stagnated in the country since Amazon boosted the annual price from $119, a sign that a subscription is less attractive to consumers struggling with a stubbornly high inflation rate. About 167 million Amazon shoppers had Prime memberships as of March, unchanged from a year earlier, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. Amazon is competing with Walmart Inc., whose $98-a-year Walmart+ membership is emerging as a lower-cost alternative offering many of the same perks as Prime and free grocery delivery on orders of at least $35. Amazon in February increased its free grocery delivery threshold to $150 from $35. For the wireless industry, an Amazon deal could be seen as a welcome boost to wholesale revenue and a way to attract more traffic to newly expanded 5G networks. But Amazon‚Äôs entry could be detrimental if Prime wireless becomes popular and starts to chip away at the big carriers‚Äô customer base.  A deeply below-market price from one of the world‚Äôs largest retailers could easily undercut the pricing power of the big three national carriers, making it tempting for subscribers to go to Amazon. Unlimited plans start at $60 a month at Verizon and T-Mobile, with AT&amp;T starting at $65. Anytime Amazon enters a new market, it sends shivers through the industry because the Seattle-based retail giant has shown it‚Äôs willing to absorb billions of dollars in shipping and movie production costs to fuel Prime membership growth. Wireless service could be just one more item that Amazon‚Äôs willing to take a hit on if it gives the company a leg up versus Walmart.,;,; 2023-06-02 15:17:52]

[Amazon stock analysis: Why it's my only holding in my portfolio,;,; I'm more bullish on Amazon today than I was two days ago. Even though their stock price has increased by 6% in after markets. I think Amazon is valued less today than before their earnings. Their earnings were that good. I'll share with you my thoughts on Amazon and why my investing portfolio will change form 80% Amazon and 20% Google to 100% Amazon the second the market opens.  Let's have a look at all their revenue streams very briefly.  AWS. Cloud computing. In the words of Andy Jassy: a technology that will change businesses around the world with the same amount of impact the invention of electricity had on businesses. Businesses are only just now starting to adopt. We are still early in the early phases of cloud computing. AWS hit 90 billion in sales this year. And their last two quarters AWS had an operating income of 30%. AWS is getting more reasons to adopt and more reasons to increase spending by their customers due to the many AI solutions it offers to companies. It's safe to say AWS will hit 100 billion in revenue next year and that this will bring in around 30 billion in operating income. Many people are scared that AWS will have their customers stolen by Azure. Firstly, 90% of the cloud engineers I talk to, prefer AWS. Secondly, it costs a ton of money to set up cloud infrastructure for businesses. Why would they throw all their money away and spend this once again to make a switch to a different cloud provider. The majority of the current customers Amazon has aren't going anywhere. You can basically look at it as a subscription. Lastly on AWS, AWS has 6 times more server capacity than the next 12 competitors combined.  Advertising. Many people tend to forget how big Amazon advertising is. It generated $47 billion in the last twelve months and it's growing at 27% year on year. That means if there are 3 more years of 25% growth we are nearing an other nearly 100 billion revenue stream. And although we don't know their margins on advertising we know nearly certainly that it's generating higher profit margins than Meta or Google due to the fact that Amazon advertising is way more targeted. Oh you're looking at Amazon.com to buy a BBQ? Here's and advertisement of a BBQ. The cost per click on those type of ads will be very high.  Warehouse and logistics. This is the least sexy side of the business, but because of the amount of revenue it's still up there potential wise. Amazon online stores and third party sellers generated $410 billion in revenue in 2023. Amazon is the leader in logistics robotics. This has not only been told by Amazon, but this was dropped in the FedEx earnings call a few quarters back. Amazon is the company that will offer the best solutions as of now. They will most likely first fulfill their own needs and afterwards export their robotics to other parties for profit although now we are getting way ahead of ourselves as Amazon still hasn't impacted their own margins. Fulfillment cost used to hover around 27% of the product sales in 2020. After Covid, Amazon invested heavily in infrastructure for logistics. This increases maintenance and the need of personnel. Also they grew too much and too fast decreasing their margins. Their fulfillment cost was 31% of product sales in 2021, 35% in 2022 peaking at 37% in Q1 2023 and now ending Q4 2023 at 34% averaging once again 35% of the net product sales being the cost of fulfillment for the full year of 2023. But we see a decrease. Amazon went from 37% in Q1 2023 to now 34% in Q4 2023. This may not seem like a lot but when we are talking about such big numbers that this has significant impact. If Amazon would get their total fulfillment cost percentage compared to net product sales down to 33% for a full year this would leave Amazon with an extra 6 billion operating income. If Amazon would get the percentage down to 30% this would mean $13.5 billion more operating income than FY2023. If Amazon would get back to their previous 27%. This would mean a total of $21 billion more operating income. And keeping their current price to operating cash flow of 20 in mind (which is low compared to the historic mean of 27) an increase of $21 billion in a year means an increase of $420 billion in market cap. Keeping automation in mind I think they should have little trouble getting back to their old percentage of 27% in the next three to five years.  Amazon Prime, now the majority of prime members are coming from the US, Europe is only just now receiving prime content from their own country and advertisements to subscribe to prime. I'm located in the Netherlands we had a company that is comparable to Amazon for online products for here and Belgium way before Amazon arrived here. Amazon has been in the Netherlands since 2014 but they are just now completely blowing the competitor out of the water. Since one year me and many others are only using Amazon and now we are seeing ads to subscribe to prime. Subscribing to prime is only valuable if you actually make use of the logistics side of things. But it helps if prime has other things to offer as well. That's where we get to my next point. Prime video is partnering up with lots of famous people here to make Prime content. And the content isn't bad at all. That prime content hasn't even been rolling out for 6 months. Prime is just in its infancy for many countries it has recently moved into. Like I said Amazon is here since 2014 but only now I'm seeing Dutch shows on Amazon prime and having lots of people ask me to share my prime account with them. I'm sure the Netherlands wont be alone in this, it will be all the other countries as well. And guess what Amazon prime just received an additional big revenue stream, advertising. All users will receive advertisements unless they pay a few dollars a month to not see ads. Netflix earns more per subscriber that's on the cheaper subscription with ads than it does on the more expensive subscription without ads.  Additionally Amazon International gets even less love. Understandable though it's less revenue and barley sees a positive quarter. But what people forget is that it took Amazon US 10 years to turn profitable. So why do we think that International will be any faster, especially considering there is less infrastructure in countries outside of the US. I'd say we might need to wait 15 years for those countries to start making a profit. So which countries have been operational for longer than 15 years? The United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, China and Canada. Which countries have been operational for less than 15 years? Italy, Spain, Brazil, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Poland, Egypt and Belgium. We don't only need time for Amazon to build out the infrastructure. The middleclass in many of these countries is still growing which will increase activity in buying. And lastly, we need to give Amazon time to make Amazon prime subscription a valuable subscription in these countries by adding local content to Prime Video.  Amazon infrastructure, like I previously mentioned AWS has 6 times the server capacity compared to the next 12 competitors. Amazon is spending by far the most on renewable energy sources. They spent $2.5 billion on renewable energy, all to power their delivery vans and their servers. Although it may not seem huge but generating their in house electricity is bound to save them billions in the long run. Also Amazon is making their own chips for their AWS servers, they don't depend on a different party to be able to deliver. This in turn also increases their margins.  Lastly, Amazon is not sitting still. They have Amazon Gaming, Project Kuiper which has 3.000 satellites in orbit, they are making a plan to revolutionize the healthcare system and make it more cost and time efficient. They say in their call that they are still investing money to look for the next big pillar of Amazon, something that will be as big as AWS, advertising or Prime. They're not sitting still.  Okay story wise, I might have convinced you by now. But you could say, this is all a bunch of promising words. What about their valuation? Due to the fact Amazon invests a lot of their cash flow Amazon has usually been valued based on their price to operating cash flow. If we take the current after market price of Amazon of $169. Their current price to operating cash flow is at 20.6. This is 15% lower than what it was 2 days ago and this is 35% lower compared to their historical median price to operating cash flow of 27. Now this doesn't per se have to mean they will ever get back to that median price to operating cash flow so lets look at some different valuation methods. Remember Paypal was attractive to many people because it was "only at a PE of 30" instead of the usual 60. So lets keep on looking.  In Q4 of 2023 alone Amazon produced $30 billion free cash flow. Now Q4 is always a record quarter so we can't multiply this by 4. Q3 of 2023 Amazon had a free cash flow of $10 billion. This was still a quarter where many of their cost saving initiatives hadn't yet fully come to fruition, so although it was a much better quarter than Q2 which generated 6 billion in free cash flow. I'm very certain that Q3 free cash flow will be more in line with upcoming quarter. If we multiply 10 billion by 3 and 30 billion once. That's a free cash flow of 60 billion. This would be their free cash flow in 2024 if they don't grow, don't further increase margins and don't continue to lessen their investing of cash flow. If we take a quite reasonable (in my opinion) price to free cash flow of 30 times we see that Amazon stock should be valued at 1800 billion market cap. That's pretty much where the marketcap is at right now. Although I'm a firm believer that Amazon will grow in 2024. Let's not forget they are giving all their prime members ads from now on, or the ability to pay more for no ads. This alone will generate around 2 billion free cash flow in my estimation. Other than that I'm expecting Amazon to grow it's already existing revenue streams further, increase its margin further and decrease CAPEX. Which should result in record free cash flow in 2024. I'm estimating 12 billion in Q1, 13 billion in Q2, 15 billion in Q3 and 38 billion in Q4. Now I would love to tell you that these estimations are highly calculated by me and a pack of mathematicians. But I'll have to disappoint you and say that it's not. I've been doing estimates on Amazon every quarter based on the trends I see in the numbers and the story I pair with it. I have been quite spot on with the numbers so far. If my estimation would be reasonably close it would mean a market cap of 2.340 trillion, an increase of 34% at a price to free cash flow of 30 or an increase to a market cap of 2.730, an increase of 57% at a price to free cash flow of 35. Do note Microsoft is valued at 40 times price to free cash flow. And although I think Amazon and Microsoft should be valued similarly I find it hard to justify a price to free cash flow of 40 or more if you're not growing cash flow above 20% YoY.  We could also disassemble the components of Amazon and value these components with the price to sales of a company that offers similar services. To some people this might be a bit more hocus-pocus but I like doing this to see where Amazon stands in the market compared to other stocks. I'm using price to sales in this example because sadly we do not know the operating income on Amazon advertising and on Amazon Prime.  AWS had a total sales in FY 2023 of $90 billion. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Microsoft of 13 times. Resulting in AWS having a marketcap of $1,170 billion.  Amazon advertising has a total sales in FY 2023 of $47 billion. Lets get the average price to sales of two companies for this one. Google of 6 times price to sales and Meta of 8 times. Thus we multiply by 7. Resulting in Amazon advertising having a marketcap of $329 billion. Even though Amazon advertising has higher margins and is growing faster than Google and Meta.  Next up Amazon Prime had a total sales of $40 billion in FY 2023. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Netflix of 7.5. Resulting in Amazon Prime having a marketcap of $300 billion.  Lastly Amazon online stores, physical stores and logistics services offered to third party sellers generated a total revenue of 392$ billion in FY 2023. Lets take a price to sales of 0.70 based on the price to sales of Walmart at 0.71 and the price to sales of FedEx at 0.69. Resulting in a market cap of $274 billion dollars.  If we calculate all the components together we have a total market cap from Amazon of 2.073 trillion. An increase of 18.5% form the current prices. And this is based on historic number, not forward looking. Similarly when using the price to operating cash flow Amazon had two days ago of 23 we see that Amazon's stock is valued at a 15% cheaper price now than just two days ago. Supporting the argument that Amazon is more less 15% undervalued based on current prices, not forward looking expectations. This is why I moved my Google position into Amazon. As Google is looking undervalued by 15% on forward looking prices, but Amazon is looking undervalued by the same amount based on historic prices. Meaning if we expect Amazon to do slightly better in the future Amazon is a better buy than Google.  TLDR: I think Amazon is undervalued by 15% based on historic numbers. Forward looking though, I expect Amazon to be more less undervalued by around 30% - 50% based on end of on end of FY 2024 numbers. This is based on how well they execute increasing their margins, decreasing CAPEX and continuing their business trends growth wise.,;,; 2024-02-02 11:25:46]
[Amazon plans to trim employee stock awards amid tough economy,;,; https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-plans-reduce-employee-stock-awards-2025-business-insider-2023-04-05/  Amazon.com Inc said it would reduce employee stock awards, a part of its compensation plan, as the e-commerce giant navigates an uncertain economy.

[Meta, Microsoft and Amazon team up on maps project to crack Apple-Google duopoly,;,; https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/26/meta-microsoft-amazon-join-overture-maps-to-vie-with-apple-google.html  Google and Apple dominate the market for online maps, charging mobile app developers for access to their mapping services. The other mega-cap tech companies are joining together to help create another option. A group formed by Meta, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, along with TomTom, is releasing data that could enable companies to build their own maps, without having to rely on Google or Apple. The Overture Maps Foundation, which was established late last year, captured 59 million ‚Äúpoints of interest,‚Äù such as restaurants, landmarks, streets and regional borders. The data has been cleaned and formatted so it can be used for free as the base layer for a new map application.  Meta and Microsoft collected and donated the data to Overture, according to Marc Prioleau, executive director of the OMF. Data on places is often difficult to collect and license, and building map data requires lots of time and staff to gather and clean it, he told CNBC in an interview. ‚ÄúWe have some companies that, if they wanted to invest to build the map data, they could,‚Äù Prioleau said. Rather than spending that kind of money, he said, companies were asking, ‚ÄúCan we just get collaboration around the open base map?‚Äù Overture is aiming to establish a baseline for maps data so that companies can use it to build and operate their own maps.  For many companies, Google‚Äôs and Apple‚Äôs maps aren‚Äôt ideal, because they don‚Äôt provide access to the underlying data. Instead, those companies allow app makers to use their maps as a service and, in many cases, charge each time the underlying map is accessed. For example, app makers pay per thousand Google Maps lookups through an application programming interface (API). Apple allows access to Apple Maps for free for native app developers, but web app developers need to pay. ‚ÄúThat works for a lot of people, but not for others,‚Äù Prioleau said.

[What is Amazons fair value?,;,; Amazon is down 39.72% over the last year, currently valued at $92.06. My basic question is: why? And what is their actual fair valuation?

[FTC and 17 states sue Amazon on antitrust charges,;,; https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/26/ftc-and-17-states-sue-amazon-on-antitrust-charges.html  * Amazon is facing its first set of antitrust charges from the U.S. federal government after the Federal Trade Commission filed its long-anticipated lawsuit against the e-commerce and cloud giant. * The lawsuit is a major milestone for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who rose to prominence for her 2017 Yale Law Journal note, ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs Antitrust Paradox.‚Äù * It‚Äôs also the culmination of several years of pressure on federal enforcers to deal with what some competitors, sellers and lawmakers have seen as anticompetitive practices.    The Federal Trade Commission has filed its long-anticipated antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.  In a sweeping complaint unveiled Tuesday, the FTC and attorneys general from 17 states accused Amazon of wielding its ‚Äúmonopoly power‚Äù to inflate prices, degrade quality for shoppers and unlawfully exclude rivals, thereby undermining competition.  The agency laid out a two-pronged strategy by which Amazon ‚Äúunlawfully maintains‚Äù its monopoly power. It pointed to so-called anti-discounting measures the company uses to punish sellers and deter other online retailers from offering lower, more competitive prices than Amazon, which translates to keeping prices higher for products across the internet, the FTC said.  Amazon also ‚Äúeffectively requires‚Äù that sellers use its ‚Äúcostly‚Äù fulfillment services in order to obtain the vaunted Prime badge for their products, the FTC said, which in turn makes it more expensive to do business on the platform.  These tactics have degraded the shopping experience on Amazon, the FTC added, and forced sellers to pay expensive fees to market their goods on the site, while facing no other choice ‚Äúbut to rely on Amazon to stay in business.‚Äù  The lawsuit is a major milestone for FTC Chair Lina Khan, who rose to prominence for her 2017 Yale Law Journal note, ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs Antitrust Paradox.‚Äù Khan argued in the article that the prominent antitrust framework at the time failed to capture the true extent of Amazon‚Äôs dominance and potential harm to competition. Through her work at the FTC, Khan has sought to reset that framework and push the boundaries of antitrust law through risky legal battles.  Amazon sought Khan‚Äôs recusal from antitrust investigations into its business, arguing that her past writing and critiques showed she had prejudged the outcome of such probes.  The charges are the culmination of several years of pressure on federal enforcers to deal with what some competitors, sellers and lawmakers saw as anticompetitive practices. Amazon was one of four Big Tech companies investigated by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, which found it held monopoly power over most of its third-party sellers and many suppliers. The majority Democratic staff at the time alleged that Amazon shored up ‚Äúcompetitive moats‚Äù by acquiring rival sites like Diapers.com and Zappos.  At the time, an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement that ‚Äúlarge companies are not dominant by definition, and the presumption that success can only be the result of anti-competitive behavior is simply wrong.‚Äù  Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, Amazon has transformed from an online bookseller into a retail, advertising and cloud computing giant with a staggering market valuation of roughly $1.4 trillion. The company has sought to expand its dominance by entering verticals like health care, streaming, and grocery, acquiring primary care provider One Medical, legendary film and television studio MGM, and upscale supermarket chain Whole Foods.  Those moves have attracted intense regulatory scrutiny. The House subcommittee report also accused Amazon of abusing its position in online retail to harm third-party merchants who rely on the platform to sell goods, and alleged it uses ‚Äústrong-arm tactics‚Äù to bully retail partners. The FTC is also reviewing Amazon‚Äôs planned $1.7 billion acquisition of Roomba maker iRobot  on antitrust grounds. Amazon recently paid roughly $30 million to settle two privacy lawsuits brought by the FTC concerning its Ring doorbell and Alexa units. The agency followed up in June with a lawsuit accusing Amazon of tricking users into signing up for Prime,  while making it too difficult for them to cancel.  Amazon‚Äôs marketplace has transformed into a linchpin of its e-commerce business since its launch in 2000. The company had already expanded beyond its origins as a bookseller to offering things like CDs and videos. But once it opened its doors to third-party sellers, it supercharged the number and variety of products for sale on its website, earning it the moniker ‚Äúthe everything store.‚Äù  The third-party marketplace has given Amazon access to a higher-margin business than just selling books. It has also increased the fees it charges sellers to do business on its site, run advertisements, and tap into its fulfillment and delivery services. In the first half of 2023, the company collected a 45% cut of every sale made by sellers in the U.S., up from 19% in 2014, according to the nonprofit Institute for Local Self Reliance. Sales from third-party sellers now comprise 60% of total units sold, the company recently disclosed.,;,; 2023-09-26 16:15:51]
[Washington prepares for war with Amazon on mergers, antitrust, privacy and more,;,; The Biden administration is planning to take action soon on at least three of its half-dozen investigations of Amazon ‚Äî moves that could lead to a blitz of litigation to rein in the iconic tech-industry giant.  The FTC has been investigating the internet titan on multiple fronts dating at least back to 2019, looking into its abuse of power within its online marketplace, as well as potential consumer-privacy violations connected to its Ring cameras and Alexa digital assistant.  The agency is also reviewing Amazon‚Äôs purchase of robot vacuum maker iRobot. Any suit against Amazon would be a high-profile move by the agency under chair Lina Khan, a Big Tech skeptic who rose to prominence with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in.  Although Amazon has already been hit by local antitrust suits in Washington, D.C. and California, the coming federal cases would be the most significant challenges to the global company yet. The exact timing of any cases or settlements is unknown.  POLITICO spoke to more than 10 people with direct knowledge of the investigations by the FTC‚Äôs competition and consumer protection teams to put together a comprehensive picture of how the agency is now pursuing Amazon, why it didn‚Äôt take action on the company‚Äôs most recent major acquisition of One Medical and what is likely to happen in the coming months. According to those people, who were granted anonymity to discuss confidential investigations:  The FTC is currently weighing whether to challenge Amazon‚Äôs $1.7 billion acquisition of robot vacuum maker iRobot, with the agency‚Äôs staff attorneys leaning toward suing to stop the deal according to three people with knowledge of that investigation. That case could come in the next few months. It has at least two open privacy investigations, one into Amazon‚Äôs Ring camera and security system business, and the other into its Alexa voice assistant over potential violations of the Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act, according to four people with knowledge of those cases. The result of at least one of the FTC‚Äôs privacy investigations could come in the next couple of months, one of the people said. FTC staff previously recommended filing a lawsuit over alleged privacy and data security violations at Ring before Khan started. Also potentially coming in the next few months is a wide-ranging antitrust case targeting Amazon‚Äôs retail operations, multiple people with knowledge of the probe said. Though the details of a complaint are not known, it could include the bundling of services through its Prime subscription business and its use of competitor data to out-muscle rival retailers on its platform, according to some of those people. The FTC has been investigating nearly every aspect of the company‚Äôs business since 2019, and a lawsuit has long been expected. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that an antitrust case could be filed against Amazon in the coming months. The FTC is pursuing a so-called ‚Äúdark pattern‚Äù probe into the difficulty customers have unsubscribing from Prime and other services. Dark patterns are deceptive tactics used by websites to trick users into doing things like subscribing to a more expensive service than they intended. It is also conducting a deceptive advertising probe into the ‚ÄúAmazon Choice‚Äù label the company gives certain products on its marketplace. The FTC is investigating how that label is used to promote products that appear in search results, including whether it is pay-to-play. Amazon maintains it is not.  Nicholas Thompson interviews David Limp onstage.  Hold the satellite subsidies. A top Amazon exec is more worried about space junk. BY JOHN HENDEL Representatives for the FTC and Amazon both declined to comment on the investigations.  The lack of action so far shows the difficulties facing the agency in taking on a company as multifaceted as Amazon ‚Äî and suggests the FTC is picking its cases with caution, according to some of the people, who are familiar with the agency‚Äôs strategy.  The FTC has sued Amazon before, accusing it of illegally withholding tips from some delivery drivers. The company settled the case and paid almost $60 million to reimburse drivers.  Top enforcement officials in the Biden administration have aggressively gone after corporate mergers and tech firms in the past year. The FTC last year sued to block Microsoft‚Äôs $69 billion purchase of Activision, and the Justice Department has two separate lawsuits against Google over its search and advertising businesses in addition to preparing an antitrust case against Apple.  The FTC is also coming off a loss in its case to block Meta‚Äôs acquisition of a popular virtual reality app. While the judge in the case validated the FTC‚Äôs novel theory that it could be illegal for companies to acquire, rather than build, a product, he also said the agency did not have the facts to support its claims.  In that environment, the FTC is under immense pressure to bring a successful antitrust case against Amazon ‚Äî particularly after letting two of the company‚Äôs largest deals through without opposition in the past year, according to agency insiders and observers.  Amazon closed its $8.5 billion purchase of MGM Studios in March 2022, with the agency‚Äôs hands tied as its four commissioners at the time deadlocked along partisan lines on whether to intervene. Then last month, the agency elected to pass on challenging the company‚Äôs $3.9 billion purchase of the primary care provider One Medical despite agency officials‚Äô belief that the deal was anticompetitive, according to three people with knowledge of the agency‚Äôs decision.  The rumble over Roombas  Most of the FTC‚Äôs Amazon investigations were launched during the Trump administration, when Republican chair Joe Simons began a broad oversight push on tech giants.  One exception is the $1.7 billion iRobot deal ‚Äî along with One Medical ‚Äî which was announced in August 2022.  The agency has not yet concluded its investigation of the deal, and is continuing to collect documents and testimony from third parties, five of the people with knowledge of the review said.  FTC staff do not believe that Amazon, the leading online retailer in the U.S., should be allowed to buy the largest maker of a popular product sold on its platform, the people said.  Among its issues, those people said, the agency is concerned that Amazon will favor iRobot‚Äôs Roombas over competing brands of automated vacuums such as Samsung. The FTC is also concerned about how the addition of iRobot will add to the control Amazon has in the broader market for connected home devices. Amazon also owns the home security company Ring, and makes the popular voice assistant Alexa and Echo smart speaker. And the FTC is asking whether Amazon would withhold Roombas from competing retailers altogether.  The FTC has also asked how the deal would increase Amazon‚Äôs control over consumer data, as well as potential privacy harms, but that is not the main focus, according to some of the people.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working cooperatively with the relevant regulators in their review of the merger. We have no plans to operate iRobot differently than how they operate today in regards to its availability through other retailers,‚Äù said Amazon spokesperson Curtis Eichelberger. ‚ÄúWe will continue to supply other retailers and vendors with iRobot products, and continue to sell other products on Amazon.com.‚Äù Amazon also plans to maintain iRobot‚Äôs interoperability with other voice assistants, Eichelberger said.  Amazon has been largely unresponsive to the FTC‚Äôs investigation so far, refusing to turn over information requested by the FTC, some of the people said.  For a targeted company, this can be a strategy to run out the clock: Merger reviews are governed by strict statutory time restrictions. In an in-depth review of a merger, the government has 30 days to decide whether to sue once a company meets all the investigative demands. Companies often agree to give the FTC or Justice Department more time, but Amazon has made no such concession, sources said.  In this case though, the FTC likely has time, given the companies also need approval in the EU and UK before they can close their deal. Those reviews are still in the early stages.

The FTC is currently weighing whether to challenge Amazon‚Äôs $1.7 billion acquisition of robot vacuum maker iRobot, with the agency‚Äôs staff attorneys leaning toward suing to stop the deal according to three people with knowledge of that investigation. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Why the FTC didn‚Äôt try to block the One Medical deal  One reason for FTC‚Äôs lack of action on Amazon so far, say experts, is that it‚Äôs technically very hard to bring cases against tech giants, either for enforcers or private plaintiffs ‚Äî in part because they control all the data that enforcers need to build a case.  ‚ÄúThe platforms have an enormous information advantage and unique access to the evidence that the government or plaintiffs need to meet their burden of proof,‚Äù said Amanda Lewis, in Senate testimony this month. Lewis is a partner with Cuneo, Gilbert and Laduca, and previously worked at the FTC and as a Hill staffer on tech and antitrust issues.  Another illustration of the difficulty is the most recent antitrust case the agency didn‚Äôt pursue against Amazon: Its $3.9 billion purchase of One Medical, a primary care company providing access to doctors through individual and corporate subscriptions.  The FTC extensively investigated the One Medical deal and found evidence of anticompetitive behavior that many at the agency considered damning, but ultimately cleared the deal because they saw it as too hard of a case to win, according to multiple people with knowledge of the agency‚Äôs thinking.  That evidence includes Amazon‚Äôs decision to abruptly end lengthy negotiations to poach some of One Medical‚Äôs corporate customers with cheaper pricing in favor of killing off its competing Amazon Care service and acquiring the company, those people said.  In one instance, Amazon was trying to lure the ride-hailing company Lyft to sign a deal for its own health care service, according to three people with knowledge of Lyft‚Äôs testimony during the merger review. Amazon offered to substantially undercut One Medical on price and offered a national network of doctors ‚Äî but when Lyft was ready to sign with Amazon, the retail giant announced its takeover of One Medical, pulled out of negotiations with Lyft, and then said it was shutting down Amazon Care, the three people said.  A spokesperson for Lyft declined to comment.  Other companies had similar testimony, two of the people said. Though many FTC staffers saw that behavior as anti-competitive and illegal ‚Äî acquiring a competitor rather than competing on the merits ‚Äî the agency ultimately decided it would be too challenging to define exactly what market Amazon was monopolizing, some of the people said.  ‚ÄúWe decided independent of, and prior to, the One Medical acquisition, that the Amazon Care offering and business model wasn‚Äôt going to work long-term,‚Äù Eichelberger said.  For the FTC, time is not on their side. With just 19 months until the election and a potential change in administration, it‚Äôs in the agency‚Äôs interest to move on these cases as quickly as possible, lest priorities change in a new regime.,;,; 2023-03-21 12:50:49]

[Amazon to invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, a rival to ChatGPT developer OpenAI,;,; E-commerce giant Amazon on Monday said it will invest up to $4 billion in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic and take a minority ownership position in the company.The move underscores Amazon‚Äôs aggressive AI push as it looks to keep pace with rivals such as Microsoft and Alphabet‚ÄôsGoogle.  Anthropic was founded roughly two years ago by former OpenAI research executives and recently debuted its new AI chatbot called Claude 2. Amazon is looking to capitalize on the hype and promise of so-called generative AI, which includes technology like OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, as well as Anthropic‚Äôs Claude chatbots.  The two firms on Monday said that they are forming a strategic collaboration to advance generative AI, with the startup selecting Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider. Anthropic said it will provide AWS customers with early access to unique features for model customization and fine-tuning capabilities.  Anthropic will also use custom AWS-designed semiconductors to train the foundational models that underpin its AI applications. Foundation models are large AI programs trained on vast amounts of data so that they can be adapted to solve a wide range of tasks.   This year, chip firm Nvidia is the chip firm that has seen the biggest gains from the generative AI boom. Nvidia‚Äôs key product is a type of semiconductor known as a graphics processing unit, which can be used to train huge AI models. At one point Nvidia‚Äôs stock had rallied more than 200%, as the company smashed through financial forecasts on the rising adoption of AI.  To an extent, Amazon‚Äôs deal with Anthropic aims to show that there are alternative chips that can be used for AI applications. AWS customers will be able to build on Anthropic‚Äôs AI models via Amazon Bedrock ‚Äî a service that lets customers build generative AI applications in the cloud via existing models, rather than train their own models.  Amazon is looking to position itself as the one-stop shop for AI. The e-commerce giant designs its own chips for training huge AI models. Through Amazon Bedrock customers can also design their own generative AI applications using existing models, which are all run on the Amazon cloud. The company sells its own AI applications too.  Anthropic already counts some high-profile backers, including Google and Salesforce Ventures. This support comes as tech giants continue to make massive bets on AI companies, a move sparked by Microsoft‚Äôs multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI in January.  https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/25/amazon-to-invest-up-to-4-billion-in-anthropic-a-rival-to-chatgpt-developer-openai.html,;,; 2023-09-25 09:01:26]

[Rivian wants out of its exclusive agreement with Amazon,;,; https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/13/rivian-amazon-exclusive-agreement-ev-delivery-trucks.html  Rivian wants out of its exclusive agreement with Amazon for the EV maker‚Äôs electric delivery trucks, a company spokeswoman said Monday.  Rivian and Amazon struck a deal in 2019 to hand over 100,000 electric trucks to the e-commerce giant. Amazon began delivering packages with the vehicles in July, and Rivian last month touted 10 million packages delivered via the vans.  But Amazon, Rivian‚Äôs largest shareholder, has since underwhelmed with its order numbers, telling Rivian it wanted to buy about 10,000 vehicles this year ‚Äî the low end of a previously stated range, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the discussions to end exclusivity.  Amazon said in a statement to CNBC that 10,000 vehicles was the original commitment, and that there has been no change to its order volume or partnership with Rivian.  ‚ÄúWhile nothing has changed with our agreement with Rivian, we‚Äôve always said that we want others to benefit from their technology in the long run because having more electric delivery vehicles on the road is good for our communities and our planet,‚Äù an Amazon spokesperson said.  Rivian spokeswoman Marina Norville said in a statement the company‚Äôs relationship with Amazon has and continues to be a positive one.  ‚ÄúWe continue to work closely together, and are navigating a changing economic climate, similar to many companies,‚Äù she said.  Eliminating the exclusivity piece of the agreement would allow Rivian to court new customers as it works to ramp production of the vans and its R1 series pickup and SUV. The company is also working on a forthcoming R2 model and is in need of cash.  Last week, Rivian announced plans to raise $1.3 billion via a sale of convertible notes to help fund R2 development and launch.

[Amazon‚Äôs AWS Plans $15 Billion Cloud Investment in Japan.,;,; https://www.barrons.com/articles/amazon-stock-aws-cloud-ai-japan-9ba095f7  Amazon‚Äôs cloud ambitions are going global.  Amazon Web Services said Friday it will invest 2.3 trillion yen ($15 billion) in Japan by 2027 to expand its cloud infrastructure in Tokyo and Osaka to meet growing demand.  Japan has lagged behind in its generative artificial intelligence development but the government, and its tech companies, are battling to catch up.  Amazon is happy to help, and in the process expand its global footprint.  In May last year, the tech giant‚Äôs cloud unit pledged to invest $12.7 billion in India by 2030, again to meet growing demand for cloud services.

The CMA said it found in its review that iRobot‚Äôs market position in the U.K. is modest and that it faces significant competition from several rivals.

Anyways my question can these companies grow their share prices when they already maximized their markets I mean how much more money can they make per year? I feel like it's a matter of holding on to key business to not lose to a competitor but as far as growth there is no more. So would that equate to the share prices hovering or slightly increasing? Like in the 90s apple had a small market with their desktops then in the early 2000s started ipods laptops then the iPhone there was so much of a market to expand upon and so much money to be made. Now everyone has an iPhone and MacBook its about keeping that consumer trend going.   So if I want to make the most out of investments I need to find companies that are like apple in early 2000s. Or can I put money in these giant companies and still see a lot of growth? Also I understand they do stock splits to offer more and keep shares down so will that continually happen making great returns possible?,;,; 2023-12-14 05:31:21]

It has already been provided to AT&amp;T, the company said late Sunday, just before the industry‚Äôs flagship show, the Mobile World Congress, began on Monday.  Microsoft acquired AT&amp;T ‚Äôs cloud-platform technology in 2021, in the process landing one of the biggest clients in the sector.  ‚ÄúAzure Operator Nexus has already been released to our flagship customer, AT&amp;T, and the results have been incredibly positive. Now, we‚Äôre selectively working with operators for potential deployments around the world,‚Äù Yousef Khalidi, a corporate vice president at Microsoft, said in a blog post.   The launch comes as carriers such as AT&amp;T and Verizon face pressure to show better returns on investments in 5G networks. Microsoft said that Nexus will make carriers‚Äô networks more efficient through the use of AI and automation.   Microsoft is taking on Amazon Web Services as it looks to expand its market share in cloud-computing services for telecoms. Amazon last week announced the launch of its AWS Telco Network Builder, which it said would make it easier for telecom companies to build their operations in the cloud.  Google‚Äôs parent, Alphabet is also seeking to attract telecoms companies, as it looks to catch up with Amazon and Microsoft in cloud revenue. On Monday, Google Cloud said it was launching three new products for telecom companies, including an AI-powered tool for analyzing subscriber behavior.,;,; 2023-02-27 17:22:08]
[Amazon is facing a major Antitrust Lawsuit from the FTC, which would reshape $AMZN's core operations,;,; Amazon is facing a major Antitrust Lawsuit from the FTC, which would reshape $AMZN's core operations.        This lawsuit is seen as 'the big one,' with FTC Chair Lina Khan leading the charge. Lina Khan is known for her hardline stance against Amazon, and may push for a radical restructuring of Amazon's business model. The Federal Trade Commission is alleging that the company is using its market power to stifle competition and harm consumers.        If the FTC is successful in its lawsuit, it could force Amazon to change its business practices and make it easier for third-party sellers to compete on the marketplace. The lawsuit could also have a broader impact on the tech industry, as it could signal a more aggressive approach to antitrust enforcement by the FTC.        The lawsuit, which is expected to be filed in the coming weeks, will focus on Amazon's core online marketplace. The FTC is alleging that Amazon is using its control over the marketplace to favor its own products and services, and to disadvantage third-party sellers who do not use Amazon's fulfillment services.,;,; 2023-06-30 18:54:31]

[Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company,;,; Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday. It‚Äôs the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmaker‚Äôs stock soaring.  Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google‚Äôs $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.  The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.  Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.  Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques ‚Äî such as transformer architecture ‚Äî used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.  Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a ‚Äúcode red‚Äù situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.  Nvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.

[Without Amazon ($AMZN), this is what S&amp;P 500 earnings would look like.,;,;  First-quarter earnings season is in full swing right now, with none bigger than last week's **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**) numbers, which topped analyst estimates. The company is now responsible for a huge portion of the S&amp;P 500's earnings performance.   E-commerce giant Amazon is the largest contributor to earnings growth for the entire S&amp;P 500 for the first quarter and 2023, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet Research Systems.  If Amazon were excluded, Butters says, the blended earning decline (reported plus expected results) for the S&amp;P 500 in Q1 would grow to -5.1% from -3.7%. And the estimated earnings growth rate for the entire S&amp;P 500 this year would fall to 0.2% from 1.2%.  FactSet says that from a macro perspective, "At the midpoint of the Q1 2023 earnings season, S&amp;P 500 companies are recording their best performance relative to analyst expectations since Q4 2021. Both the number of companies reporting positive EPS surprises and the magnitude of these earnings surprises are above their 10-year averages."  Amazon.com also is the largest contributor to earnings growth for the Consumer Discretionary sector. Excluding the company, the estimated 2023 earnings growth for the sector falls to 10.1% from 27.2%.      ## Amazon Earnings  On April 27, Amazon **reported strong first-quarter earnings and sales results** that topped Wall Street targets. Amazon earned 31 cents per share, up from the year-ago period's 38-cent loss. Meanwhile, revenue climbed 9% to $127.35 billion.  However, management said Amazon Web Services is seeing slower growth in April vs. Q1. First-quarter sales for the cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services, rose 16% to $21.4 billion, slowing from 37% growth in the year-earlier period. Analysts had projected AWS growth of 15% for the March quarter.  That spooked investors ‚Äî $AMZN stock dropped 4% in response ‚Äî because Wall Street analysts have expected **AWS revenue growth to trough** in the June quarter of 2023, then slowly reaccelerate. However, if the U.S. economy falls into a recession, the AWS slowdown could hit bottom later.  Looking forward, Amazon's 2023 earnings are expected to swing to a $1.56 per-share profit from 2022's 27-cent loss. Annual earnings are expected to jump 65% in 2024.     ## $AMZN Stock Builds New Base  Amazon stock continues to consolidate in a **cup-with-handle base** that has a 110.96 **buy point**. $AMZN stock is about 7% away from that entry, as it rallied 1% Wednesday. A key flaw is that the stock spent the entirety of the base below the **long-term 200-day moving average**.  Keep in mind that Amazon is a longtime laggard, with a weak **relative strength line**. Plus, shares remain about 30% off their 52-week high, so there is plenty of **overheard supply** that could hinder the stock's rebound.

[Disney needs to sell ESPN,;,; The world has changed and Disney needs to too.  Sports TV contracts were historically insulated from competition due to network effects.  The sporting brands could get the biggest money by selling to the companies with the widest viewership. Those with the widest viewership could afford to pay the most as they spread many fixed costs over high amounts of ad revenue.  While this dynamic hasn‚Äôt changed, the ability to monetize by the competition has. Amazon‚Äôs distribution network will allow them to pay more than others for sports rights as products and services will run ads and those that sell go through Amazon‚Äôs network. Also with linear TV you may know X million saw your ad, but on the stream you know who was logged in, and know which of the logged in people scanned the QR code. Maybe they didn‚Äôt buy the item, but they can retarget you next time you open the app. You were watching the game after all. Amazon gets paid for the Ad on the original TV and paid again to retarget the ad and then to deliver the item. How is Disney or anyone else supposed to compete with that?  If Disney sold ESPN the remainder of their business would be replicateable by competition (at least directly). There is only one Star Wars and they own the rights to the whole boat. Their model becomes purely turn IP into multiple avenues of growth.  It‚Äôs like the famous scene in Spaceballs, merchandising merchandising, spaceballs the flamethrower, the lunchbox and so on.  They can take their content creation and then license the good brand image to others.  I‚Äôm not the first to make this claim, but the case is getting stronger.  Extra:  Also I would consider selling all news networks. You can‚Äôt leverage ABC and turn it into other avenues of growth like a stuffed animal or a theme park location. It would not shock me that NFLX as it builds their library goes more and more into the licensing world without any of the legacy costs of Disney.,;,; 2023-11-25 14:30:32]

In your quest to find the next amazon remember that it will be very difficult to distinguish it from the pack. The number one goal of investing is to not lose capital. It is a difficult objective, due to the complexity and uncertainty that abounds.  Stock investing is time arbitrage. You should own at least ten companies in different industries to reduce the risk of your capital being decimated. This is very difficult to recover from not only financially but psychologically.

[Epic Games wins antitrust lawsuit against Google,;,;  SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî Epic Games won an antitrust lawsuit against Google on Monday, in a landmark decision where a jury found Google broke competition laws in how it ran its app store.  The decision is a major blow to the tech giant and the concept that Big Tech companies should have complete control over how pricing and payments are done on their massive internet platforms. It could open up other challenges to how large tech companies govern their marketplaces, potentially forcing them to allow alternate payment processors. That could cut into revenue for Google and other companies like Apple and Amazon, which make money by charging fees on any transactions on their platforms.  In summer 2020, Epic had revolted against Apple and Google‚Äôs payment-sharing systems for app developers. Epic tweaked its popular Fortnite app so users could pay the company directly. First Apple, then Google, booted Fortnite from their app stores for violating terms. Epic sued both companies, arguing the rules violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.  https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/11/epic-google-trial-verdict/,;,; 2023-12-12 01:13:50]

[Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,;,; From [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/apple-to-spend-billions-more-on-entertainment-7370447)  "Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.  KEY TAKEAWAYS Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.  The company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.  Previously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.  The move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.  Apple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release.  The company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.  The company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.  The new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).  Apple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.  So far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.  Apple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year.  In each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.  Apple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed."  Personally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.,;,; 2023-03-28 09:45:06]
[It‚Äôs year 2030, what are the world top 5 largest stocks?,;,; My bets, in no particular order: AMAZON, APPLE, MICROSOFT, BERKSHIRE, and COSTCO.   Amazon's growth is impressive, driven by its expanding e-commerce reach in a market that's still not fully tapped. This juggernaut isn't slowing down anytime soon.  Apple's success lies in its thriving ecosystem, especially its booming services like Apple Music, iCloud or Apple TV. Innovations and strong financials keep it at the forefront, not just maintaining but possibly growing its market presence.  Microsoft stands strong with AI and cloud computing innovations. Its financial resilience and predicted growth in these sectors, along with gaming new bet, make it a likely candidate for continued success.  Berkshire Hathaway's diverse investments by one of the world best capital allocators underpin its steady growth. Their strategic planning and financial acumen, along with discussions on future leadership, suggest a stable and prosperous path ahead.  Costco's growth is powered by its expanding membership and strategic global presence. Their operational efficiency and stable financial performance position them well for the future.  I bet you‚Äôll disagree. Love to hear your thoughts.  Happy Holidays.,;,; 2023-12-22 17:10:44]

[Meta ordered to suspend Facebook EU data flows as it‚Äôs hit with record ‚Ç¨1.2BN privacy fine under GDPR,;,; It‚Äôs finally happened: Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has been hit with a formal suspension order requiring it to stop exporting European Union user data to the US for processing.  Today the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) announced that Meta has been fined ‚Ç¨1.2 billion (close to $1.3BN) ‚Äî which the Board confirmed is the largest fine ever issued under the bloc‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). (The prior record goes to Amazon which was stung for $887M for misusing customers data for ad targeting back in 2021.)  Meta‚Äôs sanction is for breaching conditions set out in the pan-EU regulation governing transfers of personal data to so-called third countries (in this case the US) without ensuring adequate protections for people‚Äôs information.   European judges have previously found US surveillance practices conflict with EU privacy rights.  In a press release announcing today‚Äôs decision the EDPB‚Äôs chair, Andrea Jelinek, said:  &gt; The EDPB found that Meta IE‚Äôs [Ireland‚Äôs] infringement is very serious since it concerns transfers that are systematic, repetitive and continuous. Facebook has millions of users in Europe, so the volume of personal data transferred is massive.

[Does $HIMS have a chance against $AMZN ???,;,;  I am now convinced [$HIMS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMS&amp;src=cashtag_click) is so undervalued due to [$AMZN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&amp;src=cashtag_click) launching Amazon Clinic last month nationwide in the US. I have done some research on the competitive landscape Hims is up against!   1) Amazon Healthcare offers ‚Äúmultiple telehealth provider groups‚Äù who each set their own rates for service. The company says those visits will cost an average of $75. And $35 for a messaging session. (No insurance is accepted). I went through the sign up process for this, and it was similar to making an Amazon purchase - simple and quick. It's definitely a large competitive threat. But the platform is cut and dry and doesn't offer the educational material or specialized treatments that [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&amp;src=cashtag_click) does. Additionally the brand may not "feel" trustworthy to some with their personal health information either, IMO. Amazon has work to do on their branding power in this space. Nonetheless, I have no doubt they will be a leader in the space.    2) Teledoc - works with all major insurance carriers. The website seems a decade or 2 old for the sign up process. [$TDOC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TDOC&amp;src=cashtag_click) is a "stayer" in the space for the foreseeable future due to being grandfathered in with the insurance companies and regulators. The management has taken some large missteps recently in overpaying in purchasing other companies. I dont see them as a long term threat to [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&amp;src=cashtag_click) because their innovation is lacking, and management does not seem like a bootstrapping company like [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&amp;src=cashtag_click). Not to mention, their branding is B2B, so I get the impression they are not investing in their image/branding, which could hurt them later.    3) [$HIMS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMS&amp;src=cashtag_click) has a major advantage in this space of being one of the only major founder led companies that is a fearless innovator. While being a company focused only on healthcare, dominating multiple segments in a short period, and starting to branch out into multiple segments. Further, the B2C branding, I believe, will help them win in the long run as they build trust with the public. I believe any telehealth company should invest in building this trust the same way your local hospital builds trust with their local community.    Conclusion- [$AMZN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&amp;src=cashtag_click) is their largest competitive threat, IMO, but as [$NFLX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24NFLX&amp;src=cashtag_click) has been able to survive/thrive in the streaming space against Amazon, I don't see any reason Hims can't do the same. I believe Hims is an exciting shopping experience where you can get expert information and personalized products at a great price. A great thing about [$HIMS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMS&amp;src=cashtag_click) as well is the no judgment experience, discreet packaging, and the trustworthy reputation they're building when dealing with HIPPA. [$AMZN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&amp;src=cashtag_click)'s threat is convenience, price, deep pockets, and efficiency. However, when it comes to health, I think people will want the personalized service. It is not the same as ordering dog food and toilet paper online. One downside I've seen as well is that Amazon is basing part of their clinic business on collecting your data. I believe there will be a decent percentage of people who will not trust "big evil" Amazon with their personal health data. It is difficult to do a really good competitive analysis because some of this is still speculation since [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&amp;src=cashtag_click) and [$amzn](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24amzn&amp;src=cashtag_click) are so new in the space. A lot of segments are yet to be penetrated, and neither are able to accept insurance yet. I believe these 2 will end up taking most of the space while [$tdoc](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24tdoc&amp;src=cashtag_click) gets left behind. ,;,; 2023-10-10 23:17:54]

The cuts are part of a broader effort to reduce corporate spending and boost free cash flow. Disney said last month it plans to cut $5.5 billion in costs, including $3 billion in content spend.  ‚ÄúThis week, we begin notifying employees whose positions are impacted by the company‚Äôs workforce reductions,‚Äù Iger wrote in the memo, which was obtained by CNBC. ‚ÄúLeaders will be communicating the news directly to the first group of impacted employees over the next four days. A second, larger round of notifications will happen in April with several thousand more staff reductions, and we expect to commence the final round of notifications before the beginning of the summer to reach our 7,000-job target.‚Äù  The layoffs were initially announced in February. The job cuts will be cross-company, hitting Disney‚Äôs media and distribution division, parks and resorts, and ESPN.  Disney is following the lead of Warner Bros. Discovery and other legacy media companies that are cutting jobs and spending. Disney has said its streaming business, led by Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, will stop losing money in 2024. Disney shares are up about 8% this year after falling 44% last year.  ‚ÄúWe have made the difficult decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately 7,000 jobs as part of a strategic realignment of the company, including important cost-saving measures necessary for creating a more effective, coordinated and streamlined approach to our business,‚Äù Iger wrote. ‚ÄúFor our employees who aren‚Äôt impacted, I want to acknowledge that there will no doubt be challenges ahead as we continue building the structures and functions that will enable us to be successful moving forward.‚Äù  Since returning as CEO, Iger has reorganized the company and acknowledged that he‚Äôd consider selling Hulu. Disney will host its annual shareholder meeting April 3.  Read Iger‚Äôs full memo:  Dear Fellow Employees,  As I shared with you in February, we have made the difficult decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately 7,000 jobs as part of a strategic realignment of the company, including important cost-saving measures necessary for creating a more effective, coordinated and streamlined approach to our business. Over the past few months, senior leaders have been working closely with HR to assess their operational needs, and I want to give you an update on those efforts.

A second, larger round of notifications will happen in April with several thousand more staff reductions, and we expect to commence the final round of notifications before the beginning of the summer to reach our 7,000-job target.   The difficult reality of many colleagues and friends leaving Disney is not something we take lightly. This company is home to the most talented and dedicated employees in the world, and so many of you bring a lifelong passion for Disney to your work here. That‚Äôs part of what makes working at Disney so special. It also makes it all the more difficult to say goodbye to wonderful people we care about.

[HIMS is undervalued and has a lot of potential,;,; Fellow bag chasers,  HIMS has the potential to be a game-changer. This is professional financial advice. Kidding ! I'd just like to hear your thoughts and opinions on the stock.  Why I'm Bullish on HIMS:   1) The company is well-positioned for growth in the healthcare industry. HIMS operates a telehealth platform that connects consumers to healthcare professionals. It offers a range of health and wellness products and services on its mobile app.        The reason it‚Äôs going to be huge is because it provides prescription medication on a recurring basis and ongoing care from healthcare providers. It‚Äôs the Amazon of healthcare. Most (70-80%) of doctor visits can be treated with prescription medication. HIMS allows clients to see doctors much faster and delivers their prescription to their homes. It‚Äôs cheaper, faster and more convenient than the traditional healthcare system. HIMS is going to disrupt pharmacies the same way Netflix disrupted Blockbuster.         2) Strong product: HIMS boasts an impressive revenue growth of 52.6%, which proves their product is in high demand ‚Ä¶ and the demand keeps growing.         3) Excellent balance sheet. No debt. Assets exceed liabilities.         4) Currently undervalued : Considering HIMS solid performance, it remains undervalued compared to its peers. Simply Wall Street‚Äôs DCF Model has them 70% undervalued. This could be an excellent buying opportunity for investors looking to get in early on a potential breakout.      Risks to consider :       1) Competition. HIMS has no direct competitor. No one offers eConsultation and ePharmacy combined. Teledoc would be the closest thing to a direct competitor. That being said, Amazon is interested in delivering prescribed medication. Huge companies have a harder time with rapid innovation and competing is easier said than done, but one has to respect a player like Amazon.         2) Share dilution (HIMS is currently unprofitable)      What are your thoughts on HIMS ? Is it a promising investment or not ?    ,;,; 2024-01-11 19:44:10]

[Coupang(CPNG). Any thoughts on this company?,;,; Coupang is a South Korean e-commerce company founded in 2010. The company has quickly become the country's largest online retailer, surpassing Amazon Korea in 2018. Coupang is known for its innovative technologies, such as its own delivery network and its artificial intelligence-powered shopping platform. The company has also been expanding rapidly into new areas, such as food delivery and financial services.  **Key Drivers of Coupang's Growth:**  \-Rocket Delivery: Coupang's signature Rocket Delivery service promises delivery of orders within 24 hours, and in some cases, within hours. This has been a major factor in the company's success, as it provides a level of convenience and speed that is unmatched by traditional retailers.  This is all possible thanks to Coupang's extensive footprint of over 100 fulfillment centers across the entirety of South Korea. Given the country is fairly small, 70% of the population lives within just 7 miles of a logistics center.  Similar to Amazon, Coupang uses machine learning and artificial intelligence in order to specify which products should be stocked in which fulfillment center based on expected demand.  Coupang also offers a service called Rocket Fresh, which is similar to Amazon Fresh, offering delivery of fresh groceries. However, unlike Amazon, the company has launched a food delivery service called Eats, which was widely popular during the lockdown of 2020.  \-Data-Driven Approach: Coupang uses artificial intelligence and data analytics to personalize the shopping experience for its customers. This includes recommending products based on past purchases and browsing history, as well as offering personalized discounts and promotions.  \-Expansion into New Businesses: Coupang has been expanding rapidly into new businesses, such as food delivery and financial services. This is helping the company to diversify its revenue streams and reach new customers.  **Financial highlights:**  &amp;#x200B;  * Coupang's revenue has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 42% since 2018. * 63 P/E * 26 Forward P/E * 13.5 P/OCF * They've just become profitable in 2023, almost doubling their gross margin from 2021.  **Global Expansion:**  Coupang plans to use Taiwan as a starting point to replicate its same-day delivery success in South Korea and expand this strategy to Southeast Asia.  Coupang's next-day delivery service, Rocket Delivery, has grown faster in Taiwan in the 10 months since its launch than Rocket Delivery in Korea in the first 10 months. The company has allocated around $400 million for investment in Taiwan this year.  Replicating this business model will be harder in other countries, especially those where Amazon has a strong presence. However, the company is launching in Singapore, which only has a population of 5.7 million people and thus should be easier to penetrate.  Japan is also a key battleground as the business rolls out trial operations in the country. Tokyo specifically is a key area of focus as the population is just 14 million people and has a similar culture to South Korea. Amazon Japan is the current leader in the country, but other players such as Rakuten and Yahoo Japan hold fragmented market share positions.  Another country of focus is Malaysia. Although its population is not as wealthy as the other countries mentioned, its capital, Kuala Lumpur, has a population of 8.2 million people.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-11-13 14:15:03]

[66% down on alibaba in a rather big position, thoughts?,;,; please don't judge me, don't joke about it and only respond if you're serious.  Right when coronavirus was getting 'better' I exited all my positions and invested my money pretty much in 3 companies, Amazon, Microsoft and Alibaba. (33% each)  around 60k in alibaba, at 185‚Ç¨  Theoretically a good stock, e-commerce in china is not bad, alibaba-cloud is a good thing, massive company, numbers looked good. I'd still say that it's a good stock, if only there was no CCP.  So, it's been going down for the last few years, we're currently at ~66‚Ç¨, it was already this low like 1-2 years ago, recovered, now down again. 66% down for me.  I'm not rich at all, where others bought a department or something I have my money in stocks, and a third of it is about to be wiped out possibly. Honestly I don't think alibaba is going anywhere but who knows what the CCP will do and if/when it will recover, to 120‚Ç¨ / 180‚Ç¨, who knows.  Meanwhile the spy and all other stocks im interested in are at their alltime-high, i'm not about to sell with 66% loss, invest in something else, only for the market to go down because thats's how it goes.  For the last 3 years I thought "let's wait and see", and, well, I'm not exactly thrilled. Yeah it's trading at 7 PE, if we get positive indicators it could go back to 120‚Ç¨ I guess, already did that 1 year ago.  Any opinion on this situation? Feeling pretty bad about this.

[Not all "tech" companies deserve to have tech valuations,;,; I often hear a lot about how this &amp; that company are the next Amazon so the PE ratio does not apply to them.  There's a simple question that can tell you whether a company can have tech PEs: do they have unique products that enable them to grow their profit exponentially while keeping their costs linear? If the answer is no, they are just waiting for a correction. Even Amazon's valuation is mostly due to AWS &amp; not their retail side.   For example:  Uber should not have a tech valuation: they are a modern cab company that needs to hire drivers and deal with local presence &amp; its costs grow at the same rate as its revenue. That's why they are not profitable &amp; likely never will be.  TSLA is another one, we can all see now that they want to scale, their margins are shrinking &amp; getting closer to all other car manufacturers.  NVDA is even more prevalent: datacentres don't need an infinite number of GPUs to use pre-trained models to run generative AI applications. They currently have a demand surge &amp; after one or two quarters, the demand will go down just like the crypto craze. The $1 trillion projection Jensen did was pure nonsense. No semi company should have software tech PEs as they cannot grow exponentially while keeping their costs linear. Especially a company like NVDA which is at the mercy of TSM, ASML &amp; others to produce anything.   Edit: No, I don't have exposure to NVDA but the subreddit is full of FOMO posts in last 3 days.

I have played various other merger plays with good success but this one went against my idea of buying decent companies. **Without the merger, IRBT is still overvalued at current prices.**  If you are still in this, the risks of blockage are higher than I expected because AMZN isn‚Äôt willing to play ball. Also, considering AMZN dropped the acquisition price previously, it is possible they will drop it again due to the massive drop in price recently. Good luck to anyone who is still playing this.

[Top picks for 2024? Let‚Äôs go!!,;,; Hey guys with the new year around I was thinking what you guys are looking into buying and holding starting Jan 2024.   Here are two screening rules.  - must be listed in US (nasdaq or nyse) - must be an index stock with a market cap above 20B  Major factors for me are - interest rate cuts  - gen ai  - value vs market.   My top 5 picks for the new year: - Amazon. Overall a great company, but with the whole AI race and AWS providing it as a service, I think there will be some good tail winds for this stock in the new year.   Google: the latest AI show and tell from Google was mind blowing. They have a chatgpt killer. I think Google is back as the leader in ai based search.  Palo Alto Networks: cyber security is still going to be big in the next year and Palo Alto is comparative priced better when compared to Crowdstrike and others and they have products that align better for SMBs. So I feel they would have a good upside in comparison to competition.   Adobe:  I think this is another gen ai play. I feel with the whole digital media space has been really disrupted with gen ai. I would have loved to see the whole Figma purchase go through but nonetheless I think there is a lot going on here and I will see a lot of general users coming onboard adobe  now as the learning curve has just got flatter.   PayPal: this stock has done soo bad and fallen soo much that it‚Äôs just dead cheap in comparison to the sp500. With new leadership I feel things are going to see some improvement in the coming year.

[Nancy Pelosi's husband just snapped up $2.6 million of Apple and Microsoft stock, closing out an options bet that the shares would soar,;,; * Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month.  * Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options.  * Nancy Pelosi has repeatedly said her husband's investments have nothing to do with her political knowledge.                                                                                                                         Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday.        The transactions on the filing, marked with "SP" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16.        The Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million.        Since the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively.        First highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks.        Earlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.        Congress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress.        Legislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died.        Meanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector.        For example, in July 2021, he pocketed a $4.8 million gain in a Alphabet stock trade the week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced bipartisan antitrust bills targeting Google, Apple, and Amazon.        However, Nancy Pelosi has said repeatedly that her financier husband's trades have nothing to do with her political knowledge.

[Tesla just turned a huge financial burden into a $12.9 billion revenue opportunity.,;,; * Tesla recently added two of the world's largest carmakers to its EV charging network. * Just weeks later, more automobile manufacturers are making -- or considering -- the move.  * Some investors are viewing this as an opportunity comparable to Amazon's rollout of AWS.  #  The electric vehicle maker might be having an "AWS moment."  The past couple of years have been a bumpy ride for Tesla (TSLA). After rocketing to an all-time high in late 2021, the stock plunged more than 70% in the face of high inflation, rising interest rates, and the worst stock market downturn in more than a decade. But the tide appears to have turned over the past several months. Since bottoming in early January, Tesla shares have been on fire, gaining 149% as of this writing.   What caused this epic run? A rebound in the stock market and the recovering economy were no doubt contributors, but the biggest gains have come over the past few weeks in the wake of a few historic announcements. Several big-name automakers have ceded the high ground, joining the Tesla Supercharger network and adopting its North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector, which is now on the road to becoming the industry standard on the continent.   This stampede of partnerships prompts the question: Is Tesla having an "AWS moment"?  # The agreements driving Tesla stock higher   Late last month, Ford announced that beginning early next year, Ford electric vehicle (EV) owners would gain access to more than 12,000 Tesla charging stations across the U.S. Ford's chief customer officer, Marin Gjaja, cited Tesla's "large, reliable and efficient charging system" as the incentive.        Just weeks later, General Motors announced that it, too, would join the Tesla Supercharger network. On Tuesday, Rivian jumped on the bandwagon, joining the company's North American network, while Hyundai is considering a similar move.   In each case, the automakers have noted that after initially requiring an adapter, they would equip future EVs with an NACS charge port within the next couple of years, eliminating the need for adapters going forward.  #   The cloud connection   Back in 2000, Amazon (AMZN) was hamstrung by a number of growth-related issues, the biggest being the ability to scale its nascent operations. To address this challenge, the company developed a cloud infrastructure system that would form the foundation for its growing e-commerce business.        At the time -- and unbeknownst to Amazon executives -- the company had planted the seeds that would eventually become Amazon Web Services (AWS), its lucrative cloud computing service. After being used solely by Amazon employees for several years, the service debuted to the public in early 2006, and the company began renting out the cloud infrastructure it originally developed for in-house use. And the rest -- as they say -- is history.         AWS quickly become one of Amazon's most lucrative enterprises, a paradigm that continues to this day. In 2022, AWS generated revenue of more than $80 billion, up 29% year over year. More importantly, the cloud computing business was responsible for just 15% of Amazon's total revenue but all of its operating income -- even subsidizing the losses from its e-commerce operations.   The company is still the leader in the cloud business it pioneered, closing out the first quarter with a 32% share of the cloud infrastructure market, which is as much as the shares of Microsoft and Alphabet combined, according to data supplied by research firm Canalys.         The parallel here is clear. Tesla originally developed the Supercharger network solely for use by its customers, but it appears to be transforming into a lucrative industry standard.  # AWS moment?   The ability to take a substantial business costs and turn them into a hefty revenue generator is a rare thing, which is why some are calling this Tesla's "AWS moment." Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is one such commentator. He notes that while the company is known for accelerating EV adoption around the globe, Tesla's Supercharger network is the hidden gem that will take the company -- and its stock -- to the next level:         I believe "what has changed" for the Street over the last month is the recognition with the Ford and GM supercharger partnerships that Tesla's sum-of-the-parts valuation is now finally starting to get tapped into. This reminds us of when the Street started to realize the margin story and valuation at AWS for Amazon.        He goes on to estimate that the pacts with Ford and GM could add another $3 billion to Tesla's EV charging revenue "over the next few years."        Piper Sandler agrees and is more precise in its estimates, estimating that charging from non-Tesla customers could add $3 billion to revenue by 2030, surging to $5.4 billion by 2032. A greater number of EVs on the road -- from numerous automakers -- will no doubt accelerate this "flywheel effect," enriching Tesla and its shareholders along the way.         The company is also vying for roughly $7.5 million in subsidies offered by the Biden administration to expand its Supercharger network if other automakers have access to its system. In all, this amounts to nearly $13 billion in additional financial incentives for Tesla to open up its network.         It's also worth noting that Tesla also has a significant advantage over its rivals with one of the most cost-effective chargers in the business. The company has been able to construct charging stations for as little as $42,000 per connector, compared to a range of $100,000 to $250,000 for its rivals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tesla can use the additional funds from non-Tesla customers to expand its Supercharger network, further fueling the flywheel.         While it's still early days for these charging collaborations, this could eventually be a big revenue generator for Tesla.  #  The fine print   As previously noted, Tesla's stock price has soared this year -- up nearly 50% in the past month alone -- as a result of the recent announcements, with a commensurate increase in its valuation. The stock currently has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 77 and sells for over eight times forward sales -- a lofty valuation by any measure. For context, analysts expect the company to grow revenue by 22% and 29%, respectively, in 2023 and 2024. Value investors will no doubt balk at the stock's hefty price tag.        That said, Tesla is the undisputed leader in the U.S. EV market and is just beginning to flex its charging station muscles. If the company eventually adopts a similar strategy for batteries and energy storage solutions, Tesla's recent gains could be just the beginning for those with a long-term outlook.    ,;,; 2023-06-26 09:32:17]

[Bloomberg - Arm CEO Says AI Boom Just Beginning After Record-Setting Rally, "AI is not in any way, shape or form a hype cycle.",;,; https://finance.yahoo.com/news/arm-soars-expansion-markets-buoys-211305491.html  Arm Holdings Plc shares surged as much as 64% on Thursday after artificial intelligence spending helped bolster the chip designer‚Äôs forecast. And the company‚Äôs chief executive officer said the remarkable opportunity presented by AI is still in its early stages.  **‚ÄúAI is not in any way, shape or form a hype cycle,‚Äù Rene Haas said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. ‚ÄúWe believe that AI is the most profound opportunity in our lifetimes, and we‚Äôre only at the beginning.‚Äù**  The remarks followed a blockbuster earnings report Thursday, when Arm projected revenue of $850 million to $900 million for the March quarter. That far surpassed analysts‚Äô projections of $778 million. Earnings will be roughly 30 cents, excluding some items, well ahead of Wall Street‚Äôs 21-cent estimate.  Arm‚Äôs technology is going into an ever-widening array of products, from phones to cars to appliances. The scramble to add AI technology promises to accelerate that expansion, Haas said. In some cases, electronics makers don‚Äôt yet know how they‚Äôll fully harness AI ‚Äî they just want to make sure they have enough computing capacity to handle whatever is coming.  Arm once concentrated on technology for smartphones, but now that market accounts for about a third of sales. Phones today also contain more of the company‚Äôs technology per device, helping lift the royalties that manufacturers pay to Arm.  ‚ÄúThis is the result of strategies that were put in place a number of years ago that are coming to fruition,‚Äù Haas said in the interview. ‚ÄúA lot of folks didn‚Äôt really understand the company well and where we fit in: But we‚Äôre in a Tesla vehicle, a Ford F-150, we are in a smart camera, a Samsung TV, the smart appliances.‚Äù  Arm‚Äôs bullish outlook, delivered late Wednesday, helped send the shares on their biggest intraday rally since an initial public offering last September. The stock traded as high as $126.59, adding tens of billions of dollars to Arm‚Äôs market valuation.  Another tailwind: The company‚Äôs customers are shifting to a new version of its technology called V9, which carries twice the royalty rate of its predecessors. They‚Äôre also using more Arm computing cores per device ‚Äî more than 100 in Microsoft Corp.‚Äôs new server chips, for example ‚Äî which amplifies royalties. Arm is also gaining market share from rival technology in the data-center and automotive markets, executives said.  Arm now expects sales of $3.16 billion to $3.21 billion in fiscal 2024, which runs through March. That‚Äôs up from a previous range that topped out at $3.08 billion.  Revenue grew 14% to $824 million in the fiscal third quarter. Excluding some items, profit was 29 cents a share. Wall Street had predicted revenue of $760 million and earnings of 25 cents a share.  Arm‚Äôs joint venture in China was a ‚Äúnice positive surprise‚Äù as well, according to Chief Financial Officer Jason Child. It contributed 25% of total revenue.  Arm has an unusual role in the semiconductor industry. It licenses the fundamental set of instructions that software uses to communicate with chips. The company also provides so-called design blocks that companies such as Qualcomm Inc. use to build their products.  Under Haas, Arm has been moving toward providing more complete layouts that can be taken directly to the manufacturing stage. That shift makes it more useful to some customers, such as cloud computing companies like Amazon.com Inc., but also more of a rival to some traditional clients, like Qualcomm.  Cambridge, England-based Arm is still 90%-owned by SoftBank Group Corp., which acquired the business in 2016 for $32 billion. An IPO in 2023 raised $4.9 billion, marking the biggest debut on a US exchange in 2023.   Arm‚Äôs licensing sales rose 18% to $354 million last quarter, and royalty revenue gained 11% to $470 million.  Arm‚Äôs customer list spans the technology industry. Apple Inc. uses its instruction set for the processors that power the iPhone and Mac computers. Amazon relies on Arm designs for its Graviton server processors for data centers. And Qualcomm and MediaTek Inc. are major users of Arm‚Äôs blueprints for smartphone processors.,;,; 2024-02-08 20:56:51]

[Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..),;,; From https://www.investors.com/news/nasdaq-100-plans-special-rebalance-to-curb-dominance-of-magnificent-seven/    The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the "magnificent seven" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.  The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.  The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to "address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights."  The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.  The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.   How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted? The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.  The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.  The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.  Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.  Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.  Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.  Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.  Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.  How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut? Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.  Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.  The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.  Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023 The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.  This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.  There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.  Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices? The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.  However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&amp;P 500, which is why S&amp;P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.  The S&amp;P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.  Most of the "magnificent 7" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.  The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.  Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.,;,; 2023-07-10 20:25:37]
[Tim Cook teases Apple AI announcement ‚Äòlater this year‚Äô,;,; Apple CEO Tim Cook teased that Apple may have an artificial intelligence announcement later this year during a call with analysts after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings.  While Cook‚Äôs remarks on Thursday did not include many details, they did indicate that Apple wants to compete with Microsoft, Google, Amazon, OpenAI and other technology companies working on cutting-edge AI models that can generate text and images.  ‚ÄúAs we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future,‚Äù Cook said during a call with analysts. ‚ÄúThat includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we‚Äôre excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.‚Äù  Generative AI started drawing significant attention from technology companies and investors starting in 2022, after OpenAI released ChatGPT and image generators rapidly improved. Apple did not announce an advanced AI model last year, although the company has long invested in similar machine learning technology in its chips and software, which can, for example, identify people or pets inside photographs.  Apple typically announces new software in June at its annual developer‚Äôs conference, WWDC. Last year, the company announced an autocorrect feature for the iPhone keyboard based on a transformer-based language model, which shares the same underlying technology as GPT. But Apple never used the phrase ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù during the presentation, preferring the more academic term ‚Äúmachine learning.‚Äù  ‚ÄúLet me just say that I think there‚Äôs a huge opportunity for Apple with Gen AI and AI, without getting into more details and getting out in front of myself,‚Äù Cook said.

[Are stocks telling us a pullback is ahead?,;,; During Thanksgiving week, typically marked by reduced stock trading volume, key stocks like **Microsoft (MSFT)**, **Amazon**, **Adobe Systems**, and **Meta Platforms** hit 52-week highs.    **The S&amp;P 500** had risen 11% from its October low, with its relative strength index (RSI) reaching 71.3, suggesting potential overbought conditions. The Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq-100 also had elevated RSIs, indicating traders' uncertainty amid the battle for control of artificial intelligence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw an RSI of 71.2, influenced by Microsoft's new high.    While RSIs above 70 generally warn of a potential pullback, the current levels do not indicate extreme conditions.   Analysts foresee stocks rising into the new year, although gains may be more modest given recent increases since October. A pullback could present a watchful opportunity for bargain hunting.    ,;,; 2023-11-24 10:37:28]
[Which stocks were predicted to be the next FAANGs and are now biting the dust?,;,; I started investing about 5 years ago in 2018 and hence relatively a beginner. In the last few years several stocks were hyped to be the next FAANGs to generate 100-1000x returns. Some of them were     * PTON - predicted to be the like Nike with $250B+ market cap * ZM - predicted to be a company where millions of people collaborate for work, 200B+ market cap * APPS - predicted to be next TTD (like 40B+ market cap) * OPEN - the next Amazon with $500B+ market cap  &amp;#x200B;  There were many other predictions which sounded ridiculous then, but has now become a reality or  getting there. (Say for eg: In 2018 Tesla car owners were really happy with what they bought and predicted it to be like Apple of EVs but I did not believe and did not invest. This was when TSLA was below 50B market cap. There was another narrative that Nvidia will be the biggest company in the world in next 7-10 years  which I missed too and its now on its path.)

[Why does Kroger trade at such a low multiple?,;,; I am not American so I never visited a Kroger store, and have little idea about the quality of the experience and of its products.   Comparing Kroger to other supermarket chains (like Walmart, Target or Cotsco) make the company seem extremely undervalued. Walmart for example has a PE of almost 40, against Kroger 14, Walmart revenues are 1.5 times its market cap, Kroger's are over 4 times. Similar arguments could be made for other competitors.   By looking at the company I havent seen many problems either. Revenues are growing, and so are EPS, the debt is decreasing and the margins are quite stable. Operating income has risen a lot and the number of outstanding share has been going down. It really doesn't look bad compared to other companies in the same sector.  The biggest treat I can see is the competition from Whole Food and Amazon Fresh, but their stores aren't necesserely in the same cities, and taking over a grocery gigant like Kroger (2700 stores if I am not wrong) would be a very big task, requiring huge investments and crazy capex.

This nearly negated the 9.2% surge the company experienced on Wednesday, propelled by a robust quarterly vehicle delivery report. The bond sale decision was not well-received by investors since convertible bonds can dilute share value upon conversion. These bonds are scheduled to mature in October 2030, offering investors an option to convert them into either cash or company shares. In contrast to the bond sale setback, Rivian has showcased impressive performance in recent months. Its Q2 and Q3 2023 vehicle delivery numbers exceeded Wall Street predictions, with the company affirming its aim to produce 52,000 vehicles by the end of 2023.

I like to buy put options close to or ATM w/ long positions in stock. Nice little hedge to protect you from any downside.  My next speculative call is LCID. As of July 14. There are 2.27B shares Outs. Float of 406,097,447. Short Interest 167,766,715, roughly 41%. I do not necessarily see this as a squeeze yet. However, Bank of America just announced  that $90/ barrel is imminent. The oil supply in the US has drastically been declining. This will lead to higher prices for anything utilizing oil (Plastic, Gas, Polyurethane, Solvents, ETC.) This usually leads to people searching for cheaper alternatives.  Which is why LCID (EV in general) and anything pertaining to oil is on my watchlist. I wouldn't be surprised to see a dip and rip with anything oil.    WMT, I have been watching for quite some time now (over a year). I have a fairly large position in Walmart (over 100)  at strikes from $165-$220, about 90% expiring Dec.. Walmart started in January 2022 developing their own crypto coin. The CTO of Walmart, in October of 22' said he expects crypto to be a major payment disruptor and a very important payment tool to use. In June of 2023, they opened their second automation facility. If that isn't enough, Walmart is a major contributor in the AI industry. They have embedded AI all over their facilities and have been buying AI IP. The  FTC is also looking into Amazons rigged search results and how they advertise for business owners. Sounds like they are forcing businesses to pay more for a higher product ranking. This is among a slew of other antitrust violations. amazon could be a great short with Walmart gaining market share. If the FTC follows through on their Amazon lawsuit and they succeed at breaking up amazon. It stands to reason that Walmart will gain the majority of Amazons market share.  https://corporate.walmart.com/IRL/](https://corporate.walmart.com/IRL/  https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2023/06/15/walmart-opens-high-tech-fulfillment-center-near-indianapolis](https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2023/06/15/walmart-opens-high-tech-fulfillment-center-near-indianapolis)   This is speculation and not financial advice.

The company‚Äôs services, used by the C.I.A. and Western militaries for more than a decade, were deployed to track emergency room capacity and direct supplies of scarce equipment.  &gt; Palantir charged the government just one pound.  &gt; The deal provided the company with a valuable toehold. Since then, Palantir, which is chaired by Peter Thiel, the billionaire investor and one of President Donald J. Trump‚Äôs major 2016 donors, has parlayed the work into more than ¬£60 million in government health contracts.

[PSA: Do you beat yourself up after missing 'obvious' opportunities like Nvidia and AI? It's not just you, and it's called Hindsight Bias.,;,; Before I knew about this psychological bias, I (and many others I know) thought we just had trouble 'biting the bullet' and investing in solid ideas. Thoughts like "it was in front of me all along, but for some reason, I was too scared to put money into it" were common. But the fact of the matter is, there are thousands of 'ideas' at any given moment, and the ones that actually make the news and become multi-baggers were **not** obvious in the past. So why do people feel this way, that they keep 'missing' out on obviously great investments? This is what is known as Hindsight Bias.   Hindsight bias is, [according to Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hindsight-bias.asp), "a psychological phenomenon that allows people to convince themselves after an event that they accurately predicted it before it happened. This can lead people to conclude that they can accurately predict other events. Hindsight bias is studied in behavioral economics because it is a common failing of individual investors."  Why is knowing about hindsight bias significant? One, because if you believe that you **did** have proper insight and analytical skills to spot future success stories, then you might chase after any idea that looks good to to you **now**. However, unless you actually have proof that you were able to consistency find good ideas in that past that you simply didn't capitalize on, then you should not trust just your memory. Otherwise, one would pick potentially bad investments, and then **think** that they knew about other better ideas, repeating the cycle.   It's also important to recognize this bias just for your state of mind. Enough people feel bad enough about missing multi-baggers like Amazon when they should be giving themselves a break. Saying you could have made made 100k if you only invested in some stock years ago is not the same as losing 100k, or we'd all be in the hole. So don't fret about the past and keep looking to the future. There are still plenty of opportunities out there, so best of luck investing!   **Tldr:** Whatever happened in the past was not obvious, no matter how much it feels like it. Don't be overconfident that you can catch future ones but don't beat yourself up over missing opportunities either. Focus on the future!,;,; 2023-06-01 23:17:42]

[Powerhouse Picks: META, AMZN, or NFLX - Unveiling the most compelling FAANG stock,;,;    # Meta Platforms ($META)  Shares of social media giant Meta Platforms have rallied by a phenomenal 107% year-to-date. The company impressed investors by returning back to revenue growth in the first quarter (after three straight quarters of decline) despite subdued digital ad spending due to macro pressures.  Investors have also cheered the company‚Äôs aggressive cost-cutting and streamlining efforts, including thousands of layoffs. Despite the distraction caused by regulatory matters, most Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about Meta‚Äôs prospects.  Meta‚Äôs user base continues to expand, with daily active people (number of users who visited at least one of the family apps ‚ÄìFacebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp in a day) growing 5% year-over-year to 3.02 billion (on average) in March. The company expects capital expenditure of $30 billion to $33 billion this year toward the build-out of its artificial intelligence (AI) capacity to support ads, Feed, and Reels as well as increased investment in generative AI initiatives.  **Is Meta a Good Stock to Buy?**  On Tuesday, Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion reiterated a Buy rating on Meta Platforms stock with a price target of $270 after taking a deep look at the company‚Äôs AI capabilities.The analyst sees the company leveraging AI to boost user engagement, develop better and more automated advertiser tools, and create an open-source AI ecosystem. Champion is also optimistic about Meta‚Äôs positioning within the digital ads space.  ## Amazon ($AMZN)  Like Meta, Amazon is also reducing its costs to navigate a tough business backdrop. The company‚Äôs retail business has been under pressure due to the impact of macro challenges on consumer spending. Additionally, the slowdown in the growth rate of the higher-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has also been concerning. Enterprises are moderating their IT budgets, which is weighing on AWS‚Äôs growth.  Wall Street continues to be bullish on Amazon and sees solid potential in the retail and AWS divisions over the long term. Moreover, AMZN‚Äôs rapidly growing advertising business is also expected to boost revenue in the years ahead. Despite macro pressures, Amazon‚Äôs ad revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $9.5 billion in Q1.  **Is AMZN a Buy, Sell, or Hold?**  Earlier this week, Mizuho analyst James Lee increased his price target for Amazon to $160 from $145 and reiterated a Buy rating, calling the stock his top pick for the second half of 2023. The analyst expects multiple expansion as concerns about the company‚Äôs AI market position ‚Äúdiminish.‚Äù  Recent channel checks by Lee‚Äôs firm with a leading channel partner indicated that AWS‚Äôs generative AI demand has been accelerating due to the ease of transition and product differentiation.  ‚ÄúCase studies show that AWS wins over clients on intelligence privacy and data security,‚Äù said Lee. Further, he also highlighted that generative AI is priced meaningfully higher than conventional computing, so it is expected to be both revenue and margin accretive to AWS. Consequently, Lee believes AWS revenue growth will likely trough in Q2 before rebounding in the second half of the year.  ## Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)  Netflix‚Äôs crackdown on password sharing has improved investor sentiment about the streaming giant. Password sharing has been a key concern for Netflix, especially as competition has become intense in the streaming space. Netflix had previously estimated that over 100 million households share accounts, representing 43% of its global user base. This week, Netflix rolled out its password-sharing crackdown to its home market.  Aside from the password-sharing crackdown, Netflix‚Äôs business is expected to improve through its recent introduction of a cheaper, ad-supported tier.  **What is the Price Target for Netflix?**  On Thursday, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein increased the price target for Netflix stock to $450 from $415 and maintained a Buy rating in reaction to the launch of paid sharing offering at $7.99 per additional household stream.  Prior to the announcement, the analyst‚Äôs firm conducted a survey of 1,800 U.S. Netflix consumers. The survey indicated a healthy propensity to pay for ‚Äúremote‚Äù users, with certain abandoned users willing to pay for their own subscriptions.  While 45% of respondents indicated a willingness to pay for ‚Äúremote‚Äù users, 70% indicated an inclination for the $6.99 ad-tier plan. With pricing of the paid sharing option above the ad-tier, the survey suggests a significant portion of these users will be pushed toward the ad-based offer.  # Conclusion  Wall Street is more bullish on Meta Platforms and Amazon compared to Netflix. Given the massive rally in Meta stock, Wall Street sees higher upside potential in Amazon stock from current levels. Analysts mainly see solid potential in Amazon‚Äôs AWS cloud business, supported by solid demand for cloud computing and prospects for growth in the AI space.,;,; 2023-05-29 11:19:17]

[Would it be ridiculous to buy up First Republic Bank (FRC) in hopes there is a buyer of their shitstorm?,;,; I have in the past made money by investing in times of trouble, just in companies that I thought had a future. For example I bought up stay at home stocks like Amazon in March 2020, but also bought the dip in Simon Properties in May 2020 and held until 2022 for a nice profit.   First Republic Bank is a little different. They may end up like the many companies in 2009 that went away forever and there never was a chance of a lifesaver. However, what if they do get saved? What if something happens out of left field soon, such as the government suddenly doing a 180 and saying they are going to bail them out. Crazier things have happened.,;,; 2023-03-20 17:40:25]
[Netflix is up 137% in the last year. Is this a breakout or a fakeout?,;,; # Shares of the streaming stock are on fire. Will the boom last?   The stock market has been full of surprises this year, including the emergence of artificial intelligence as a key narrative, the resilience of the U.S. economy, and the boom in big tech stocks.        Among the most unexpected winners, this year is Netflix (NFLX 0.36%), the leading streamer, whose shares dove most of last year as growth slowed and it faced a new wave of competition from legacy media companies.        After losing more than two-thirds of its value over a six-month span in 2021 and 2022, Netflix has managed to flip the narrative -- the streaming stock is now up 44% year to date and 137% over the past year. Those gains have come for two primary reasons: the introduction of password-sharing fees and the launch of its ad-supported subscription tier.         Both of those moves reflect changes the company has made to its longtime strategy. Let's take a look at the implications of each one to see if the stock can sustain its recent gains.    # Paid sharing  Paid sharing is likely the most controversial move Netflix has made in a long time. The streaming service had long turned a blind eye toward password sharing as the company believed that it was a way of promoting its service. Management also seemed to think that password borrowers would subscribe directly to the service when they were ready.  However, Netflix's maturing user base seemed to convince the company to crack down on password sharing. Instead of essentially allowing unlimited sharing, Netflix has sent notices to its members telling them that their account is only for them and the people in their homes. They can pay an additional $7.99 per month to share their account with someone who does not live with them.        Netflix implemented paid sharing in May, and the stock has jumped since the rollout, up nearly 20% since May 23, when it announced the new policy in the U.S. According to media reports, the move drove a spike in new subscriptions, and over the four-day period from May 25 to May 28, its new customer additions were higher than in any period since at least 2019.        Analysts have roundly cheered the move as well, seeing it as essentially 100% incremental profit as there are basically no costs associated with it. Netflix has yet to report earnings since it rolled out paid sharing, but we should get a sense of the impact when Netflix announces second-quarter results next month.  # The new ad tier  While the password-sharing crackdown should give its bottom line a boost, the ad tier rollout is likely to give a longer-term lift to the business as it allows the company to tap into a new revenue stream and supplement payments from subscribers.   Reed Hastings, who recently stepped down as co-CEO of Netflix, recognized this opportunity after long resisting advertising, as he noticed that advertiser demand was following TV audiences from linear TV to streaming outlets.        The vast majority of subscribers are expected to remain in the ad-free tier, but Netflix is using the ad-based tier to attract new subscribers. And it appears to be working. As of May, the company had added nearly 5 million subscribers to the ad-supported tier, just six months after the launch, and more than 25% of new subscribers are choosing the ad tier in markets where it's available.  # Is the comeback for real?  Netflix's stock is still down significantly from its peak in late 2021, which came after the subscription boom early in the pandemic, so the recent resurgence should be viewed in that context.        The streamer now faces significantly more competition than it did just a few years ago, but many of its legacy competitors are focused on cutting costs in order to drive profits at their streaming businesses, which gives Netflix an advantage as it not only has a large audience to monetize its content spending, but it also has proven its profitability.  After the rally, Netflix stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of around 40 based on this year's estimates, which seems fair given its ability to gain operating leverage as it grows revenue.   While I wouldn't expect another doubling of the stock, it should be able to hold its gains this time around.

[Shopify ($SHOP) up 85% this year, time to sell the stock?,;,; * Shopify is a leading e-commerce platform growing faster than the overall industry. * The company botched its logistics investments and is now facing pressure from Amazon.  * Shares look extremely expensive at these prices.  # Growth prospects look strong, but don't forget that price matters.   Stocks have soared to start 2023, reversing a lot of the painful losses for investors in 2021 and 2022. Growth stocks have especially rallied, with many stocks greatly outpacing the 15% gains for the S&amp;P 500 index year to date (YTD). Shopify (SHOP -2.10%) is one of these growth companies.        Shares of the e-commerce software and payments platform have popped 85% YTD, with the stock now sporting a market cap of $83.5 billion. Since the company went public in 2015, shares are up 2,200%, making it one of the top-performing stocks worldwide over that time span, especially for large-cap companies.          With the stock up so much this year, should you sell your shares of Shopify and walk away? Or are there still more gains to be had in this growth compounder?        Growing faster than peers but without cost discipline    One thing all investors can agree on with Shopify is that it's growing quickly and gaining market share with its core e-commerce services. Last quarter, payment volume through its merchant customers grew 18% year over year in constant currency, which is much quicker than the 10% projected growth for the global e-commerce market this year.  Revenue is growing even quicker than payment volume, up 27% year over year to $1.5 billion in the first quarter. This is occurring as more merchants and customers are adopting Shopify's internal payment processor, which allows it to earn a sizable take rate on every transaction processed through its platform. In the first quarter, internal payments volume was 56% of total payments volume compared to 51% in 2022. If this trend continues, it will lead to Shopify's revenue growing quicker than its total payment volume, which is already outpacing the overall e-commerce market. This is a good recipe for durable double-digit revenue growth.        While revenue growth has been great, Shopify has shown a lack of efficiency with its cost structure. In the first quarter, the company posted an operating loss of $193 million -- or 13% of revenue -- compared to 8% of revenue a year ago. With the platform closing in on $6 billion in annual revenue, there is no excuse for Shopify to not generate any bottom-line profits. These losses will need to reverse in the next few years, especially if revenue continues to compound to even higher levels.   # Fumbling the logistics opportunity, competition with Amazon payments   Over the last few years, Shopify has talked a big vertical integration game about how it would start competing with Amazon in delivery and logistics for its merchants. It spent $2.1 billion acquiring start-up Deliverr and said it would invest billions of dollars into the Shopify Fulfillment Network.  But in 2023, after realizing Deliverr had negative gross margins and that it could not compete with the tens of billions in infrastructure spending from Amazon, UPS, and FedEx, Shopify did a complete U-turn and exited all of its logistics investments, including divesting its Deliverr acquisition to Flexport. The company not only wasted a ton of money trying to invest in logistics, but this exit now significantly shrinks Shopify's addressable market, a big selling point for growth investors interested in the stock.        This competition with Amazon may only get worse. Last year, the technology giant released a beta version of the "Buy With Prime" button, which allows merchants to process payments and shipping on their own third-party websites exactly as they would when selling on Amazon. Most of Shopify's revenue comes from its own payment processor, meaning its revenue will take a hit if any merchant customers start offering Buy With Prime. Since the payment buttons are all the same for the consumer, it is likely that many e-commerce shoppers would switch to the Amazon solution if it means the fastest shipping times.    # The valuation doesn't make sense at these prices   Even with the looming risk from Amazon, Shopify shares have soared this year and now sport a steep valuation that makes the math for positive forward returns very difficult.       For one, even though it looks like a software company, Shopify's gross margins are much lower than you might think. As you can see from the above chart, the company only generated $2.8 billion in gross profit over the past 12 months compared to $5.9 billion in revenue, or a margin of 47%. A mature company run efficiently can generally convert around half of its gross profit into earnings. Since Shopify is an aggressive spender, let's say it will convert a bit less at maturity and hit 20% net profit margins.  If Shopify is able to fend off looming competition from companies like Amazon and keep growing revenue at 20% a year, it will hit $14.7 billion in revenue five years from now. With a 20% profit margin, that equates to $2.9 billion in earnings. Compared to its current market cap of $83.5 billion, that would be a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 28.5 five years from now. This is higher than the market average today and requires Shopify to grow its revenue at a 20% annual rate for five straight years.         The math doesn't work for Shopify at these prices unless you believe the company will accelerate its growth rate or magically expand its profitability. Even though it means a tax hit if you've held for many years, now is looking like a good time to sell your shares of Shopify and redeploy the cash into cheaper stocks.,;,; 2023-06-19 09:37:29]

[Short sellers are betting more than $1 trillion against US stocks after big run,;,; * Total US short interest exceeded $1 trillion as of last Friday, S3 Partners data shows. * The top five shorts are mega-cap tech stocks Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon * That comes after big stock market gains so far this year.  US short interest this month rose to the highest level since April 2022, as investors bet that the current bull run in the stock market is set to falter.  According to data from S3 Partners, the amount spent by short sellers against US stocks hit $1.02 trillion, as of Friday. Those bets came even as they continued to rally earlier this month, costing short sellers $101 billion.  S3 data shows that the top shorts are Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. As of Friday, their collective short interest topped $83 billion.  The bearish sentiment results from skepticism about how much higher stocks can go. So far this year, the S&amp;P 500 is up 13.5%, and the Nasdaq is up 29%.  But since the Federal Reserve last week indicated more rate hikes are on the table this year, stocks have been on a losing streak.  This year, Wall Street has been caught up in the hype over artificial intelligence companies, which saw their valuations skyrocket and have brought more investors into the market due to "fear of missing out."  But big names have voiced divided outlooks on the AI frenzy. For instance, while Stanley Druckenmiller sees Nvidia as a stock worth holding for the next couple of years, short seller Jim Chanos has demonstrated skepticism towards the stock.  Meanwhile, the prospect of continued hawkishness from the Fed has added to macroeconomic risks. A recent Goldman Sachs report put the odds of a recession in the next 12 months at 25% and warned a downturn could cause a 23% decline in the S&amp;P 500.  Still, if bullish investors win out, short positions could eventually support market gains, as a short squeeze forces more buying and boosts stocks.,;,; 2023-06-24 10:48:34]

[How Shopify ($SHOP) 'shape shift' made e-commerce firm attractive again,;,; E-commerce software and services provider Shopify ($SHOP) suddenly looks a lot different to investors in the wake of a strategy shift. Canada-based Shopify in early June completed the sale of its fulfillment unit, easing investor angst over rising investments for SHOP stock.        With the move, Canada-based Shopify slashed capital spending and improved its financial outlook.        "Post the recent 'shape shift' where it exited the logistics business and reduced over 20% of the workforce, the company is free cash flow positive," said UBS analyst Kunal Madhukar in a recent report.     **Covid Emergency E-Commerce Boost**    Further, Shopify stock has jumped 90% in 2023 as of June 14. Shopify stock has gained 42% since the company announced the sale of the fulfillment business to privately held Flexport on May 4. SHOP stock rebounded from a 2022 sell-off spurred by worries over growing investments and management turnover.        Shares are trading near a 14-month high, trying to clear a short consolidation forged after surging on May 4 following the first-quarter earnings report and the Flexport deal.   "While SFN (Shopify Fulfillment Network) turned out to be an expensive experiment, we also must recognize that Shopify made a fast pivot ‚Äî taking calculated risks can sometimes lead to strategic mistakes," said Baird analyst Colin Sebastian in a report. "We still believe Shopify can be a trillion-dollar GMV (gross merchandise volume) platform with take rates expanding as the company widens in scope."        In 2022, Shopify's GMV growth slowed to 12% ($197.2 billion). GMV growth has been trending down since 2020 when it boomed 96% during the coronavirus pandemic. Consumers shifted to online shopping during the emergency. In addition, Shopify in 2022 accounted for roughly 18% of all U.S. e-commerce, says UBS.        According to research firm Gartner, Shopify is the largest e-commerce software provider with about 15% global share, ahead of SAP (SAP) and Salesforce (CRM). Shopify garners nearly two-thirds of revenue from the U.S.        Shopify sets up e-commerce websites for businesses. It partners with companies such as Stripe to handle digital payments. Well-funded and fast-growing Stripe has put off an initial public offering.        Among merchants services is Shop Pay. It's an accelerated checkout option for stores on the Shopify platform. Shopify Capital provides loans to merchants. The new Shop Cash rewards program provides consumers with incentives, aiming to boost GMV through higher orders.        **SHOP Stock: PayPal Friction?**    Meanwhile, Shopify has encroached on PayPal Holdings (PYPL), said Lisa Ellis, analyst at SVB MoffettNathanson in a report.        "PayPal and Shopify have a long-standing partnership and PayPal enjoys a privileged position on the Shopify platform," said Ellis in a report. "However, many of Shopify's payments-related initiatives pose a competitive threat to PayPal."        She noted Shopify Payments, a payment processing service offered through Stripe. Ellis also noted a "buy now, pay later" consumer financing service that Shopify now offers through Affirm Holdings (AFRM).        Meanwhile, to build up a logistics business that stored and shipped products for its merchant customers, Shopify had acquired Deliverr for $2.1 billion in 2022. In 2019 it bought startup 6 River Systems for $450 million.        Flexport will be Shopify's logistics partner under a revenue-sharing arrangement. Shopify now holds a 13% equity interest in Flexport.        **Shopify To Join Amazon Buy With Prime?**   Amid the sale, there's also speculation over a possible Shopify deal with e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN).        Amazon now offers its massive distribution network to merchants that do not sell goods on its website. Amazon's product fulfillment services are part of a program called Buy With Prime.        At UBS, Madhukar says Shopify could join the Buy With Prime program based on management comments on Shopify's first-quarter earnings call.        "The company said things are moving positively in their discussions with Amazon on BwP, which could suggest they may be closer to getting a deal done," Madhukar said. "Although it is still unclear whether a deal will make SHOP whole on gross profit dilution, a resolution could result in a better merchant and consumer experience, and lead to higher volumes that may offset any potential dilution."        Also, Shopify rival BigCommerce (BGIC) uses Amazon's fulfillment services.        Started in 2006, Shopify recently hiked contract prices for merchants.        In the quarter ended March 31, Shopify earned one cent per share on an adjusted basis, down a penny from a year earlier. Revenue for SHOP stock rose 25% to $1.5 billion, the company said.        Analysts expected the Shopify earnings report to show a loss of 4 cents on revenue of $1.435 billion. Gross merchandise volume rose 15% to $49.6 billion, topping estimates of $47.75 billion.        In 2023, Wall Street analysts expect adjusted profit to boom to 33 cents a share from 4 cents last year. Shopify earnings per share is projected to rise 70% to 56 cents in 2024.    Revenue will rise 20% to $6.74 billion this year and 18% in 2024 to $7.93 billion, analysts predict.        Shopify Stock: Enterprise Marketing Push    To spur GMV growth for SHOP stock, Shopify has partnered with Facebook (FB), Pinterest (PINS) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google in social media marketing.        Meanwhile, analysts expect Shopify to target larger companies.        In May, Shopify launched a program called Commerce Components. It enables businesses to integrate Shopify's checkout and back-office services with their existing online platforms. Further, toymaker Mattel (MAT) is one early customer.        "Subscription pricing increase that rolled out at the end of April will be a key catalyst supporting topline growth and margins," said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney in a report. "And Shopify continues to drive product innovations, especially for enterprise solutions. Commerce Components offers a lightweight solution for large enterprises without replacing the merchants' whole online infrastructure.",;,; 2023-06-15 05:00:44]
[Nvidia, Equinix team up to offer AI supercomputers to businesses,;,; Source: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-equinix-team-up-offer-ai-supercomputers-businesses-2024-01-24/)  * Data center operator Equinix and Nvidia said on Wednesday they had partnered up to offer the chip firm's supercomputing systems to corporate clients.  * The service will make it easier for companies to own artificial intelligence computing systems and have better control over their data, instead of renting out Nvidia's market-leading chips from cloud computing providers like Amazon.com or Microsoft.  * Many large businesses have shown interest in owning their AI computing system for privacy and security reasons, but Nvidia systems are different from conventional data center servers, often using different networking cabling and requiring liquid cooling.  * Under the deal, Nvidia has trained Equinix staff in how to build and run its systems. Corporate customers will purchase Nvidia systems but pay Equinix to build and run them efficiently while still retaining ownership.  * "We want to drive privacy because what we're hearing at large customers is they are very worried about controlling their own destiny," Jon Lin, executive vice president and general manager of data center services at Equinix, told Reuters in an interview.  * However, "being able to then figure out how to operate (AI data centers) efficiently and effectively - this is an entirely new set of capabilities that is not generally available."  * Nvidia and Equinix said the new offering is available as of Wednesday but did not disclose any immediate customers.  Will this have a big impact on the companies involved? Is there a real fear of Amazon losing customers? Disclosure: I own stocks in all companies mentioned except Equinix.,;,; 2024-01-24 14:27:36]

[Paramount cutting 25% of workforce and shutting down MTV News after disastrous earnings,;,; Bloomberg:  "Paramount Global, looking to reduce costs as it copes with a loss of traditional TV viewers, is letting go of about 25% of the staff in its domestic cable networks and shutting down MTV News after four decades on the air.  Employees are being notified Tuesday, the company said in a statement. Paramount is combining nine separate teams into one. It had already announced plans to merge its Showtime and MTV studios  Despite subscriber growth and new hit shows, ‚ÄúWe continue to feel pressure from broader economic headwinds like many of our peers,‚Äù said Chris McCarthy, head of the company‚Äôs media networks.  Paramount shares collapsed 30% last week after the company reported an 11 per cent decline in ad sales at its traditional TV networks and a US$511 million loss in streaming. The results underscore the challenges big media companies face in making the transition to online viewing."  [Full article from Bloomberg here](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/paramount-cuts-25-domestic-cable-staff-ends-mtv-news)  This move also comes after a Wells Fargo analyst suggested that Paramount gets out of the streaming game altogether and go down the Sony route of selling their content to the highest bidder. He further argued that there's little point continuing to bludgeon money whilst fighting to be 5th place at best in the streaming wars (since there's little hope of beating Amazon, Apple, Disney, HBO, or Hulu).   Full article on that from [IndieWire here](https://www.indiewire.com/news/business/paramount-plus-quit-streaming-analyst-1234859135/)  Personally, I would have to agree.

[Where are you building positions?,;,; I have a very small portfolio, about 14k. Over the last few years I lost a very, very substantial amount of money as a % of my portfolio making stupid trades. Mostly trying to be too cute with long dated call options that went terribly in the wrong direction and expired worthless, credit spreads, chasing some WSB tickers. Basically trading like I'm in a literal casino.  The last 18 months or so I've mostly gotten back on the right track and have been building positions in the big names that have been traditionally good bets over a long horizon. Google, apple, Amazon, meta, tesla, Microsoft, Nvidia, visa, you get the idea. I recently started a new job and can comfortably put $1000 a month into the market to chase some growth while equally contributing to my savings.  Something nearly all of these companies have in common is that they are all hovering at or near 52 week highs and while I'm not entirely deterred by that it gives me some pause.  Personally my next thought is to build a bigger position in the s&amp;p and nasdaq indices over the next few months since I'm currently concentrated in individual companies.

[UPS Signs minimum hourly wage increase of 35.5% for part-time workers and average total driver compensation to $170,000.,;,; https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/22/ups-workers-approve-new-labor-contract.html  * Part time workers will make $21 from currently $15.50. * Full time workers will be paid $49 an hour an increase of $7.50 over the contract.  Total compensation with benefits will be $170,000.   * Average base pay before overtime or benefits will be approximately $102,000. * The new contract includes pay raises for both part-time and full-time workers. * It also includes other improvements to work rules including an end to forced overtime. * Workers began voting on the new contract on August 2.  American Airlines also approved 46% increase in compensation and the UAW is also demanding 46% increase in compensation, voting on August 22nd whether or not to authorize a strike.  UPS workers ratified a massive five-year labor deal that includes big wage increases and other improvements to work rules and schedules, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said Tuesday.  The deal passed with 86.3% of votes, the highest contract vote in the history of Teamsters at UPS, according to the union.  ‚ÄúTeamsters have set a new standard and raised the bar for pay, benefits, and working conditions in the package delivery industry. This is the template for how workers should be paid and protected nationwide, and nonunion companies like Amazon better pay attention,‚Äù Teamsters General President Sean O‚ÄôBrien said in a statement.  UPS and the Teamsters union, which represents about 340,000 workers at the delivery giant, reached a preliminary deal last month, narrowly averting a strike that could have rippled throughout the U.S. economy as the previous contract expiration on July 31 approached.  UPS moves $3.8 billion worth of goods a day, about 5% of the country‚Äôs gross domestic product, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  The parties had until July 31, when the previous labor contract was set to expire, to reach a deal and avoid a work stoppage. Workers began voting on the new contract on August 2. It‚Äôs the single largest collective bargaining agreement ever reached in the private sector, according to the union.  Part-time workers will make no less than $21 an hour, up from a minimum of $15.50 currently, according to the union. Part-time pay was a sticking point during labor negotiations. Full-time workers will average $49 an hour. Current workers will get $2.75 more an hour this year and $7.50 an hour more during the five-year contract.  UPS drivers will average $170,000 in pay and benefits at the end of the five-year deal, CEO Carol Tom√© said on an earnings call earlier this month.  The company cut its full-year revenue and margin forecasts, citing the ‚Äúvolume impact from labor negotiations and the costs associated with the tentative agreement.‚Äù  The union is the latest labor organization to push a major U.S. company for better pay, schedules and other work rules in the wake of the pandemic and decades-high inflation.  On Monday, American Airlines pilots ratified a four-year deal that includes roughly 46% increases in compensation, including 401(k) contributions, a deal the carrier sweetened after rival United Airlines reached a richer agreement with its pilots‚Äô union. Delta Air Lines  ‚Äô pilots approved their deal, which include more than 30% raises, earlier this year.  Southwest Airlines  hasn‚Äôt yet gotten to a deal with its pilots‚Äô union, which has laid the groundwork for a potential strike, though such stoppages in the airline industry are exceedingly rare under U.S. laws.  FedEx pilots turned down a tentative agreement for a new labor contract earlier this summer.,;,; 2023-08-22 20:45:44]

[Are non-dividend stocks pure speculation?,;,; Hello guys, this is a post I wrote 220 days ago but couldn‚Äôt publish due to a lack of Reddit karma. Funny to see how my examples aged, but my core question is still valid so I post again.  I know this kind of a question has been recently often asked on this sub, but the more I read and the more I get confused.  The main counter argument that I‚Äôve read is that as a shareholder you actually own a part of the company, which includes its assets but also its cash. That‚Äôs true yes, but what can you do from it in reality ? Nothing. We cannot request to trade our stock directly with the company for the asset/cash equivalent.  The only options to get money from your stock are : - company is bought by another one - dividend is distributed  - you sell higher than you bought.  If none of the two first options happens, then it seems to be like speculation. You sell higher to someone that expects to also sell higher. Also let‚Äôs not forget that companies keep a big part of stocks on their side so they can still control what happens in the company (e.g. dividend distribution).  Let‚Äôs take an example : SNAP. The stock selling price has decreased by 90% over a year.  There was a time the company was actually profitable with a bright future. It made sense to invest at that time and to expect at some point a return on the investment. Now the stock price has dropped and what can you do from it ? Maybe the company is going to oblivion, not able to generate free cash flow anymore until eventually get delisted. And then what ? The only thing I can see is ¬´¬†you should not have invested in this company¬†¬ª. Ok but what about Google, Amazon etc. Do you say the same ? What if Amazon has the same outcome in few years ? If it starts to fall what can you do ?   Note: I have never owned SNAP stocks.,;,; 2023-02-28 18:43:05]

[Disney+ Sheds 4 Million Subscribers in Second Straight Quarterly Drop, Streaming Losses Narrow by 26%,;,; From [Variety](https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/disney-plus-subscribers-q2-earnings-1235607524/):  Primary takeaways -  * Disney+ lost 4 million subscribers in Q2 2023, marking its second consecutive quarterly drop. * However, the company narrowed its streaming business losses by $400 million YoY. * The sub drop was driven by a 4.6 million sequential decline at Disney+ Hotstar, the version of the service offered in India and parts of Southeast Asia. * In the US/Canada, Disney+ lost about 300,000 subscribers while it added nearly 1 million in international markets excluding Disney+ Hotstar. * Hulu gained 200,000 in the quarter to stand at 48.2 million, and ESPN+ increased by 400,000 to 25.3 million. * Hulu content will be introduced on Disney+ later this year in a ‚Äúone-app experience.‚Äù * Disney is ‚Äúin the process of reviewing the content on our DTC services to align with the strategic changes in our approach to content curation‚Äù and ‚Äúwill be removing certain content from our streaming platforms.‚Äù * Disney‚Äôs Parks, Experiences and Products group saw revenue climb 17% to $7.8 billion and operating income rise 23% to $2.2 billion. * The company's Direct-to-Consumer revenue for the quarter rose 12%, to $5.5 billion, while its operating loss decreased 26% to $1.1 billion. * Disney's content spending cuts will hit primarily in 2024, because so much has already been committed this year.  Disney+ shed another 4 million subscribers in the first three months of 2023, marking the streamer‚Äôs second consecutive quarterly drop after closing 2022 with its first-ever decline. On the bright side, the Mouse House also managed to narrow its streaming business losses by $400 million, down 26% year over year.  On Wednesday, CEO Bob Iger and Co. beat Wall Street estimates for Disney‚Äôs quarterly earnings and revenue due to an impressive January-March showing at the company‚Äôs theme parks. That win comes during a fiscal Q2, which concluded April 1, plagued by company-wide layoffs, a looming (and now active) writers strike and a turf war with Florida Gov. Rick DeSantis.  Disney ended the quarter with 157.8 million subscribers at Disney+, significantly missing Wall Street‚Äôs estimate of 163.17 million subs. That projected figured would have been up from the 161.8 million subs Disney+ fell to the prior quarter.  This second sub drop was driven by a 4.6 million sequential decline at Disney+ Hotstar, the version of the service offered in India and parts of Southeast Asia. Last year, Disney lost streaming rights to Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches, which prompted it to lower growth targets for Disney+ Hotstar in India.  In the U.S./Canada, Disney+ lost about 300,000 subs (to reach 46.3 million), while it added nearly 1 million in international markets excluding Disney+ Hotstar.  Hulu gained 200,000 in the quarter to stand at 48.2 million, and ESPN+ increased by 400,000 to 25.3 million.  During Disney‚Äôs earnings call with analysts later Wednesday, Iger ‚Äî who returned to his post as CEO last fall upon the ousting of Bob Chapek ‚Äî announced that Hulu content will be introduced on Disney+ later this year in a ‚Äúone-app experience.‚Äù  Also on the call, CFO Christine McCarthy announced Disney is ‚Äúin the process of reviewing the content on our DTC services to align with the strategic changes in our approach to content curation‚Äù and ‚Äúwill be removing certain content from our streaming platforms.‚Äù  According to McCarthy, Disney expects a writedown in Q3 of $1.5-$1.8 billion from removing the content. McCarthy also said ‚Äúgoing forward we intend to produce lower volumes of content in alignment with this strategic shift.‚Äù  The content spending cuts will hit primarily in 2024, because so much has already been committed this year.  Wall Street forecast earnings per share (EPS) of 93 cents on $21.78 billion in revenue, according to analyst consensus data provided by Refinitiv. Disney reported adjusted EPS of 93 cents on $21.82 billion in revenue.  Disney posted negative free cash flow of $168 million for the quarter.  Starting with its fiscal Q2 2022, Disney restructured its financial results into two segments: Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products.  Disney‚Äôs Direct-to-Consumer revenue for the quarter rose 12%, to $5.5 billion, while its operating loss decreased 26% to $1.1 billion ‚Äî which was better than analysts forecasted.  At Disney‚Äôs linear TV networks, revenue dropped 7% to $6.6 billion, and operating income decreased 35% to $1.8 billion.  Revenue for Disney‚Äôs domestic TV channels business, which include ABC and ESPN, decreased 4% to $5.6 billion and operating income decreased 33% to $1.6 billion. The drop in operating income was attributable to lower ad revenue and higher sports programming and production costs.  International channels‚Äô revenue for the quarter dropped 18% to $1.1 billion and operating income fell 65% to $85 million.  The brightest spot for Disney in the quarter was its Parks, Experiences and Products group, which saw revenue climb 17% to $7.8 billion and operating income rise 23% to $2.2 billion, reflecting increased guest spending at international and domestic parks and experiences (primarily at Disney‚Äôs international parks and resorts).  Content Sales/Licensing and Other revenues, which includes box office revenue, increased 18% to $2.2 billion and saw an operating loss of of $50 million, down from an increase of $16 million year over year.

[Zoom is cutting about 150 jobs, or close to 2% of its workforce,;,; Zoom is cutting about 150 jobs, CNBC confirmed on Thursday, the latest tech company to slash headcount this year as investors continue to push for efficiency.  A Zoom spokesperson confirmed the cuts amount to less than 2% of the company‚Äôs workforce.  ‚ÄúWe regularly evaluate our teams to ensure alignment with our strategy,‚Äù the spokesperson told CNBC in a statement. ‚ÄúAs part of this effort, we are rescoping roles to add capabilities and continue to hire in critical areas for the future.‚Äù  Zoom said the layoffs are not companywide, and added that it will continue to hire for roles in artificial intelligence, sales, product and across operations in 2024.  The cuts at Zoom were first reported by Bloomberg.  As of Thursday, more than 100 tech companies have laid off about 30,000 employees to start the year, according to layoffs.fyi. January was the busiest month for job cuts in the industry since March.  Last month, Microsoft  cut 1,900 positions in its gaming division; Google  said it‚Äôs eliminating hundreds of roles across the company; and Amazon  laid off employees across its Prime Video, MGM Studios, Twitch and Audible divisions.  In addition to Zoom, cloud software vendor Okta  announced a downsizing on Thursday, telling employees that it‚Äôs laying off 400 staffers, or about 7% of its workforce.  Zoom exploded in popularity at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as workers turned to the video-conferencing platform to stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family.

[Exclusive: Nvidia pursues $30 billion custom chip opportunity with new unit -sources,;,; https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-chases-30-billion-custom-chip-market-with-new-unit-sources-2024-02-09/       SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for cloud computing firms and others, including advanced artificial intelligence (AI) processors, nine sources familiar with its plans told Reuters.  The dominant global designer and supplier of AI chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market for custom AI chips and shield itself from the growing number of companies pursuing alternatives to its products.  The Santa Clara, California-based company controls about 80% of high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock market value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023.  Nvidia's customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT.O), opens new tab, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab and Meta Platforms (META.O), opens new tab, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of its chips to compete in the fast-emerging generative AI sector.  Its H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time to design.  Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to rival firms such as Broadcom (AVGO.O), opens new tab and Marvell Technology (MRVL.O), opens new tab, said the sources, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  "If you're really trying to optimize on things like power, or optimize on cost for your application, you can't afford to go drop an H100 or A100 in there," Greg Reichow, general partner at venture capital firm Eclipse Ventures said in an interview. "You want to have the exact right mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need."  Nvidia does not disclose H100 prices, which are higher than for the prior-generation A100, but each chip can sell for $16,000 to $100,000 depending on volume and other factors. Meta plans to bring its total stock to 350,000 H100s this year. Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon.com (AMZN.O), opens new tab, Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for them, two sources familiar with the meetings said. Beyond data center chips, Nvidia has pursued telecom, automotive and video game customers.  Nvidia shares rose 2.75% after the Reuters report, helping lift chip stocks overall. Marvell shares dropped 2.78%.  In 2022, Nvidia said it would let third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking technology with their own chips. It has said nothing about the program since, and Reuters is reporting its wider ambitions for the first time. A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company's 2022 announcement.  Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), opens new tab and Marvell executive, heads Nvidia's custom unit and her team's goal is to make its technology available for customers in cloud, 5G wireless, video games and automotives, a LinkedIn profile said. Those mentions were scrubbed and her title changed after Reuters sought comment from Nvidia.  Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment.     **$30 BILLION MARKET**  According to estimates from research firm 650 Group‚Äôs Alan Weckel, the data center custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year, and double that in 2025.  The broader custom chip market was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023, which amounts to roughly 5% of annual global chip sales, according to Needham analyst Charles Shi.  Currently, custom silicon design for data centers is dominated by Broadcom and Marvell.  In a typical arrangement, a design partner such as Nvidia would offer intellectual property and technology, but leave the chip fabrication, packaging and additional steps to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330.TW), opens new tab or another contract chip manufacturer.  Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales.  "With Broadcom's custom silicon business touching $10 billion, and Marvell‚Äôs around $2 billion, this is a real threat," said Dylan Patel, founder of silicon research group SemiAnalysis. "It's a real big negative - there's more competition entering the fray."  **BEYOND AI**  Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson (ERICb.ST), opens new tab for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics processing unit (GPU) technology, two sources familiar with the discussions said. Ericsson declined to comment.  650 Group's Weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year. Nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video game markets, according to sources and public social media postings.  Weckel expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6 billion to $8 billion range at 20% a year, and the $7 billion to $8 billion video game custom chip market could increase with the next-generation consoles from Xbox and Sony (6857.T), opens new tab.  Nintendo's current Switch handheld console already includes Nvidia's Tegra X1 chip. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is likely to include a Nvidia custom design, one source said.  Nintendo declined to comment.,;,; 2024-02-09 23:15:02]

[I've got $500K burning a hole in my pocket: should I bet it all on tech stocks?,;,; I am 33.  I have been operating a business the past 6 years and have about $500k in a high-yield savings account.  I held more cash than I think I would have liked to because I wanted to reinvest in the business and potentially try some new ideas.    &amp;#x200B;  Nonetheless I am sitting on post-tax cash of $500k.  I already have $335k in 401(k) with 100% in VTI.  Although the Marcus high yield savings is great I feel like I am sitting on way too much cash. Ideally I want to hold at least $150k so I have runway for business for the next year or two.     Obviously all of us wish we had thrown a large brick of cash into tech stocks, etc. at the end of 2022 - trying not to let that sting but it definitely is hard feeling like I could have just thrown money into stocks and not had to work so hard building a business - hindsight bias is a bitch lol.  I am grateful to be in this position but still feel like I have totally missed the boat.  &amp;#x200B;  I am thinking about putting like $300k into Google, Amazon and Microsoft because I feel that cloud computing and AI are only going to become more popular.  I use AWS a lot and see almost all of my clients using AWS.  Also maybe Apple just because they have a really good moat.  &amp;#x200B;  Bottom line is should I just throw excess capital into tech stocks, put it all in VTI or do something else?  I calculate if I just do VTI and chill it will be worth like $5M later but I am like...AI is going to change earth, needs significant compute from the cloud and even though I missed the 2023 runup in tech it feels like there is still a lot of growth left.  My goal is to get as rich as possible as young as possible, ideally without having to wait to 59.5 years old to withdraw.  &amp;#x200B;  I feel extremely confused about what to do next and financial advisors I talk to all seem to honestly have no idea what to do either.

[Shopify ($SHOP) stock upgraded, claws above 50-day moving average,;,;  **Shopify** ($**SHOP**) is the **IBD Stock of the Day** as the e-commerce firm popped above its **50-day moving average** Wednesday following an analyst upgrade. Shopify remains a controversial stock amid stiff competition.    Started in 2006, Canada-based Shopify sets up e-commerce websites for small businesses and partners with others to handle digital payments and shipping.   It competes with **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **PayPal Holdings** ($**PYPL**), **Wix** ($**WIX**), **BigCommerce** ($**BIGC**), and several others.  On the¬†**stock market today**, Shopify was up more than 4% at one point but gave back some of those gains as the market fell. Shares ended the trading day 1.2% higher to 45.30. Shares have climbed 30.5% in 2023 versus the Nasdaq's 14% gain in the wake of last year's downturn.  In a period of consolidation, Shopify stock has a traditional **entry point** of 54.76.  ## Earnings Due For Shopify Stock  More aggressive investors could consider taking a position at 48.36 amid a handle still in formation. The handle would be in the lower half of the base, which is a flaw.  Earnings for Shopify stock are due in early May. ¬†Investors may want to be cautious ahead of the earnings report. One strategy around earnings would use **call options**.  At JMP Securities, analyst Andrew Boone on Wednesday upgraded Shopify to market outperform from market perform with a price target of 65.  Further, Shopify is building a U.S. distribution network to store and ship products for its merchant customers. Rising investments for the distribution network have been one overhang on the stock.  ## Amazon Ramps 'Buy With Prime' For Merchants  In addition, Amazon has launched a new initiative. Amazon is offering its massive distribution network to outside merchants. Merchants who do not sell goods on¬†its website can use Amazon's product fulfillment services for delivery and returns as part of a program called Buy With Prime.  ## SHOP Stock Gained During Pandemic  At MoffettNathanson, analyst Lisa Ellis also views Shopify as a market share taker.  "Selling shovels to miners in an e-commerce gold rush is the perfect business," Ellis said in a note. "Shopify seized the opportunity of the (coronavirus) pandemic and now powers 10% of all U.S. e-commerce. The gold rush has slowed. Shopify's multiple has contracted as investors digest a secular growth story transitioning to one of increased capital intensity and questions on profitability."  Meanwhile, Shopify stock holds an IBD **Composite Rating**¬†of 85 out of the best possible 99, according to¬†**IBD Stock Checkup**.  IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. Also, the best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.  Further, Shopify stock has an Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B. That rating analyzes price and volume changes in a stock over the past 13 weeks of trading. Its current rating indicates more funds are buying than selling.  ## Shopify Stock: 2023 Revenue Outlook Missed  The rating, on an A+ to E scale, measures the institutional buying and selling of stock. A+ signifies heavy institutional buying; E means heavy selling. Think of the C grade as neutral.  For the period ended Dec. 31, Shopify said it earned 7 cents per share on an adjusted basis, down 50% from a year earlier. Also, revenue for Shopify stock rose 26% to $1.7 billion, the company said.  Analysts expected the Shopify earnings report to record a loss of 1 cent on revenue of $1.65 billion. A year earlier, Shopify earned 14 cents per share on revenue of $1.38 billion.  For the first quarter of 2023, the company predicted revenue growth in the "high teens." Analysts had projected more than 20% revenue growth. And in January, Shopify hiked contract prices for merchants.,;,; 2023-04-13 06:31:11]

[WSJ - S&amp;P 500 ends longest bear market since the 1940s and signals beginning of new bull market.,;,; U.S. stocks rose Thursday, ending the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs longest bear market since the 1940s and marking the start of a new bull run.   The broad index powered higher over the past few months, in large part because of a handful of companies posting outsize gains.  Many of those same stocks, including Amazon.com, Tesla and chip maker Nvidia, led the market‚Äôs advance Thursday.   That helped propel the S&amp;P 500 up 0.6%, allowing the index to finish up 20% from its October low.  The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to 33833.  Treasury yields retreated. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 3.714%, down from 3.782% Wednesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.  Analysts attributed the relative calm to traders taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of key events next week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release fresh data on inflation Tuesday, while the Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest-rate decision Wednesday.  So far, positioning in futures markets suggests many traders are betting the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged in June. That might offer markets some relief in the short-term, although investors warn that there could still be more policy-tightening ahead.   ‚ÄúA pause does not mean they are done with rate hikes,‚Äù said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors.   Traders are betting volatility could pick up in the coming months. The options contracts with the biggest positions tied to the Cboe Volatility Index, or Wall Street‚Äôs ‚Äúfear gauge,‚Äù are wagers that it will surge to 30‚Äîa level associated with investor anxiety‚Äîor 60, a level only seen during stock-market crashes.  Among individual stocks, electric-car maker Tesla jumped 4.6% to $234.86, posting its 10th straight session of gains. That marked the company‚Äôs longest winning streak since an 11-session run that ended in January 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data.   Carvana, the online used car retailer, rose 56% to $24.23 after saying it expects its profit to jump in the second quarter.  GameStop plunged 18% to $21.44 after the videogame retailer fired its CEO, Matt Furlong, and appointed board member Ryan Cohen as its new executive chairman.   U.S. crude oil prices initially dropped after a report suggested U.S.-Iran talks on a temporary nuclear deal could allow the Islamic Republic to export more crude. They pared some of their losses by the end of the trading day, though, finishing down 1.7% at $71.29 a barrel.  Global stock markets were mixed.

[E-commerce stocks rally after Black Friday shoppers spend record online,;,; During Thanksgiving and Black Friday, online spending in the U.S. set records, with Black Friday reaching $9.8 billion, up 7.5% from the previous year, and Cyber Weekend online sales surging 7.7% to $10.3 billion.         Cyber Monday is expected to hit $12.4 billion, making it the biggest online shopping day of the year. E-commerce-focused retailers like Etsy, Wayfair, Amazon, and Shopify saw stock surges. Analysts monitor these sales as a barometer for the overall holiday shopping season.         Despite inflation and high grocery prices, the National Retail Federation predicts a 3% to 4% YoY increase in November and December sales.        Buy-now-pay-later services, including Affirm, Klarna, and Afterpay, drove $5.9 billion in online spending, up 13.4% from last year. Klarna's CEO highlighted the significant market share gained by such services. New entrants like TikTok and Temu capitalized on holiday demand with promotions, offering discounts and deals.        ,;,; 2023-11-28 10:25:41]

[Cisco cutting 5% of global workforce in restructuring move,;,; Cisco announced plans to cut 5% of its workforce on Wednesday, a decision that will result in the elimination of about 4,250 jobs. Shares were down 4% in extended trading.  It‚Äôs the latest tech company to downsize in 2024, as the industry continues to squeeze out costs following the market downturn that hit two years ago. January was the busiest month for job cuts in the industry since March, as Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft and SAP all said they were eliminating positions, as did eBay Unity and Discord. So far this year, 144 tech companies have laid off almost 35,000 workers, according to the website Layoffs.fyi.  In addition to disclosing the job cuts, Cisco reported strong fiscal second-quarter results but gave a light forecast. Here‚Äôs how it did in comparison with the consensus from LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:  Earnings per share: 87 cents, adjusted, vs. 84 cents expected  Revenue: $12.79 billion, vs. $12.71 billion expected  Cisco‚Äôs revenue declined 6% year over year during the quarter, which ended on Jan. 27, according to a statement. Net income declined to $2.63 billion, or 65 cents per share, from $2.77 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.  Revenue from networking products totaled $7.08 billion, slightly below the $7.10 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.  With respect to guidance, Cisco called for 84 to 86 cents per share on $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG were looking for 92 cents per share on $13.09 billion in revenue.  For the full year, Cisco sees $3.68 to $3.74 in adjusted earnings per share and $51.5 billion to $52.5 billion in revenue. Analysts had projected $3.86 in adjusted earnings per share, with $54.26 billion in revenue.

[Are any of these stocks I just bought yesterday good swing trades for the holiday season coming?,;,; I went and looked for a few hundred ticker symbols of mega, large and mid cap - also a few small caps. Saw a few that are either retail or in a space that should do good as the holiday season approaches. Here are a few of them with why I bought:   TGT \[Target\] = Target has its problems such as organized theft like most chain stores do. Target also has its base of customers that want to shop there and nowhere else. Looking the last 10 years over it usually performs well between September and January, about 70% of the time (some of its best runs came from fall - late winter).   W \[Wayfair\] = Wayfair has its base of customers that are loyal to it. Although it had a boom and bust cycle from 2020 until now due to COVID restrictions going from being a thing to not anymore - I see this stock as a good play for the next 6 months. People are still moving (upper middle class) and finding new jobs, many that require relocation. People who helped pump W to go over 10X in 2020 are the same people who will buy things from them during the holiday season, if they move hundreds of miles away, etc.   ORCL \[Oralce\] = They are a powerhouse of a company - the small caps cannot compete, and I am unaware of a single company that I've used who has stopped using them to use another product. Seems oversold (for those who know about charts - it has a double top). [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ORCL&amp;p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ORCL&amp;p=d)   NG \[Novagold Resources Inc.\] = The price of gold the last few weeks has plummeted 5%, and it has for no reason. A company that I like is NG and they report earnings next week. They have a multiple bottom in their charts for chart people. [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NG&amp;ty=c&amp;p=d&amp;b=1](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NG&amp;ty=c&amp;p=d&amp;b=1)   AMZN \[Amazon\] = No explanation needed, it's amazon. ,;,; 2023-09-30 10:29:39]
[Is virtual reality something worth investing in?,;,; It seems like the stocks which consistently outperform the overall market are in new mediums. The most recent would be in tech stocks with Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Google. Considering that virtual reality could be the next big thing, it could deliver very large returns. Of course, if it's just a fad, it will lose money. Or maybe there will be a bubble which pops like in 2000 with tech overall.  I don;t know if Facebook would be worth buying into since they're kinda leading the charge into virtual reality, even if they'll probably be overtaken by another company which does it better as precedent has shown us.,;,; 2023-04-08 06:49:09]

In the week through Jan. 30, a ratio of bulls to bears identified in an Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers hit its highest since around mid-2021, months before stocks neared their prior peak, Yardeni Research analysis shows.*  *‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a ‚Äòrah-rah‚Äô mob mentality in the stock market, with some traders drunk on their own wine,‚Äù betting on Fed easing as soon as March and upwards of six cuts this year, said Nick Giacoumakis, president of NEIRG Wealth Management. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrealistic.

The S&amp;P 500 hasn‚Äôt seen a streak like that since 1986.*  *Solid earnings from Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. drove the strength at the end of last week, after Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. released results that fell sort of investor expectations on AI.*  *February has a tendency to start on a high note, although the strength typically fades around mid-month as investors book profits, according to Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac. That‚Äôs particularly the case if stocks get a boost in January ‚Äî like they often do ‚Äî following tax-loss harvesting in December.*  *For the skittish camp, the latest signals from the Fed are a source of angst.*  *Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested last week that the central bank wasn‚Äôt about to lower rates anytime soon, and that was before Friday‚Äôs blockbuster jobs report. After that data, swaps traders chopped the probability of a March rate cut to around 20%, and no longer see a May reduction as a done deal.*  *For some would-be dip-buyers, that raises red flags, especially with the latest Deutsche Bank AG data showing that aggregate equity positioning among rules-based and discretionary funds is in the top quarter of observations going back to 2010. The bullish skew raises questions over who‚Äôs left to buy after fund managers piled into stocks at a furious pace in November, December and January.*  *‚ÄúI really hope we get a correction in the stock market soon,‚Äù said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. ‚ÄúA selloff may not feel good at first, but I have a lot of money that I want to put to work for my clients.‚Äù*  *She plans to use any pullback to add shares of Palo Alto Networks Inc., Microsoft and Amazon.*  *At NEIRG Wealth, Giacoumakis said he owns megacap tech stocks, which have driven the bulk of the market‚Äôs advance over the past year, but he isn‚Äôt adding to his position due to lofty valuations.*  *Members of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies, the biggest firms in the S&amp;P 500 ‚Äî Apple Inc., Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. ‚Äî carry a 33% premium to the index in terms of forward price-to-earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show.*  *Of course, sentiment can stay frothy for weeks ‚Äî even months ‚Äî before stocks suffer a significant drop, notes Hirsch at the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, who correctly called the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs double-digit rise in 2023.*  *Take 2021, he said: Back then, the ratio of bulls to bears in the Investors Intelligence survey was hovering at current levels for most of that year, while equities continued to rip higher.*  *‚ÄúStocks are ripe for a pullback soon, but nothing sinister,‚Äù said Hirsch, who sees the S&amp;P 500 potentially topping 5,000 this month before retreating to its prior high near 4,800 ‚Äî or a 4% drop.*  *‚ÄúMarket breadth is already lacking right now, with fewer stocks participating in this rally.‚Äù*,;,; 2024-02-09 18:49:32]

[Pinterest shares crater 25% on weak revenue and forecast,;,; Pinterest shares plummeted 25% in extended trading on Thursday after the company issued a weaker-than-expected forecast and missed on revenue.  Revenue: $981 million vs. $991 million expected, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.  Earnings: 53 cents per share, adjusted, vs. 51 cents per share expected, according to LSEG.   Revenue rose 12% year-over-year from $877.2 million a year earlier, while net income was $201 million, or 29 cents a share, up from $17.49 million, or 3 cents a share, a year ago. it brought in the previous year.  Monthly active users in the fourth quarter rose 11% to 498 million, topping analyst estimates of 487 million. The company said its global average revenue per user was $2, lower than analyst estimates of $2.05.  Pinterest said first-quarter revenue will be between $690 million and $705 million, which equates to year-over-year growth of 15% to 17%. The middle of that range, $697.5 million, is below the average analyst estimate of $703 million.  Pinterest‚Äôs report comes as the broader digital advertising market is showing recovery, with Meta , Alphabet  and Amazon  all picking up steam and growing their ad business by double digits in the fourth quarter. The data suggests that businesses are boosting spending on online promotions after cutting back in 2022 and part of 2023 over concerns about the Ukraine-Russian war and high interest rates.  But not all online ad companies are seeing the benefits. Snap shares cratered 35% on Wednesday after the company reported fourth-quarter sales growth of 5%, trailing expectations, and the company also issued weak guidance.  Prior to Thursday‚Äôs report, Pinterest shares were up 9.5% this year after surging 53% in 2023.  Costs dropped about 10% from a year ago to $785 million, largely due to a decline in sales and marketing expenses. A year ago Pinterest slashed about 5% of its workforce, part of a mass waive of job cuts across the tech industry.

[WBD narrows streaming loss thanks to 3x higher content licensing revenue ($410M). More "co-exclusive" deals coming.,;,; The company‚Äôs DTC division reported $410 million in licensing revenue, more than triple last year‚Äôs sales, after offering shows like ‚ÄúWestworld‚Äù to rivals  Revenue from licensing HBO content buoyed Warner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs streaming business in the second quarter, the company revealed in its earnings report Thursday. The sales helped significantly narrow its loss and appeared to be playing a big part in the company‚Äôs promise for its U.S. direct-t0-consumer business to turn a profit in 2023.  The media giant reported $2.73 billion in revenue in its DTC segment, which launched its Max service during the quarter. That was a 37% leap from last year‚Äôs second quarter, and represented about 26% of the company‚Äôs total revenue for the period. The segment swung to a $3 million EBITDA loss for the second quarter after reporting $50 million in positive EBITDA in the first quarter.  Content licensing revenue at $410 million revenue rose notably, more than tripling the $132 million reported in the same quarter last year, suggesting that the company would have had a far more significant loss without those fees.  The growth in licensing reflects a surprising move in recent months toward offering HBO shows like ‚ÄúWestworld‚Äù to free, ad-supported streaming TV services like Amazon‚Äôs Freevee and the Roku Channel. Warner Bros. Discovery also licensed HBO shows including ‚ÄúInsecure‚Äù to Netflix.  CEO David Zaslav said on a call with analysts Thursday that it would seek to do deals on a ‚Äúco-exclusive‚Äù basis, meaning the licensed shows would also be available to Max subscribers.  Distribution revenue of $2.19 billion made up the bulk of the division‚Äôs total, including traditional HBO subscriptions, Max and HBO Max subscriptions, and Amazon Prime Video Channels revenue. Advertising revenue jumped 26% to $121 million, also mainly driven by subscriber growth. Total DTC subscribers fell by 1.8 million in the quarter to 95.8 million.  Zaslav told analysts the company‚Äôs deep content library ‚Äúoffers a wealth of opportunity in terms of feeding our own platforms, as well as others.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a mainstay of our business to create great content and window width, through creating value in each window,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd as you would expect a lot of analysis and strategic discussion goes into these decisions. In some cases, we‚Äôll want to keep premium content exclusively on our platform for a very long time. In other cases, we may sell it to third parties, and we don‚Äôt lose anything by growing the pie.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe fact is licensing some library content to others VOD platforms like Netflix or Amazon as part of a co-exclusive agreement is just smart business,‚Äù Zaslav said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre expanding our audience, while maximizing the value of the asset and providing more revenue streams. And that is our job, to optimize the windowing to get the best possible return on investment.‚Äù  Warner Bros Discovery also inked deals with Roku and Tubi to license 2,000 hours of content and launch a series of channels in January. It also plans to introduce its own FAST service this year.  Later in the call, the CEO noted that if the Hollywood strikes continue, ‚Äúthere may be more demand‚Äù for WBD content.,;,; 2023-08-03 16:27:21]

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-south-koreas-coupang-buy-151417128.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-south-koreas-coupang-buy-151417128.html)  What a massive fall for Farfetch. The company was innovative, but its debt was a red flag, and its business model was confusing. Are they trying to be the Amazon of luxury fashion or the Shopify for luxury fashion, or both? Their acquisitions were confusing, heavily taking on inventory and operating physical stores like Browns and Stadium Goods.  This is an intriguing deal for Coupang. It will be interesting to see how much they liquidate Farfetch's assets. Are they primarily focused on Farfetch Platform Solutions powering the backend of fashion e-commerce or the digital marketplace and growing that brand?  It could be a great deal for Coupang or a distraction from their core business.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-12-19 02:24:52]
[MercadoLibre seems absurdly undervalued.,;,; My portfolio is up 50% this year.  I have a portfolio that is 100% growth stocks and I‚Äôve taken some time to look at valuations to evaluate if I have companies that seem to be over their skis in terms of valuation.  I‚Äôve been looking at lots of stocks in terms of reverse dfc and it seems to me that MercadoLibre is undervalued by about 50%.  They are still growing sales by more than 30% y/y and are improving their operating margin by increasing take rates and reducing costs.  They turn out outstanding results quarter after quarter and when faced with competitive threats from players such as Amazon and Shopee, they just keep coming out on top.  I have a somewhat focused portfolio of 9 stocks, but with the numbers I‚Äôm seeing, I just really want to put everything into MercadoLibre (not that I have a big portfolio - just around 30k)  Every other growth stock I evaluate seems either overvalued or reasonably valued, taking into account ten years of reasonable growth assumptions.  Take Nvidia for example.  I own Nvidia and based on my reverse DCF, if they can grow FCF by 30% for ten years, the stock is currently fairly valued.  I think they might be able to pull that off, so Nvidia might be worth owning.  But according to the same model, MercadoLibre only needs to grow FCF 11% annually over the next 10 years to justify their current valution.  This just seems like an absurdly low bar for them.  If my model is off, it would be off in the same direction for all the companies im evaluating.  Part of me thinks I should just invest in this one company that has both amazing fundamentals and low valuation.  Another part of me is just saying ‚Äúhell no!  Always stay diversified!‚Äù  It‚Äôs like Cramer vs Munger in my head.  One voice says ‚Äú5 stocks minimum‚Äù. The other says, ‚Äúwhy buy anything but your best idea?‚Äù  Peter Lynch is also in my head.  I live in Mexico and use Mercado Libre‚Äôs services, so it‚Äôs a company I can get behind on a personal level.  I think Lynch would approve.  I‚Äôve just never put all my money into one stock before, but this seems like an insane bargain.    What do you think?  I‚Äôd love to either be talked off the ledge here or encouraged.,;,; 2023-09-09 18:50:00]
[Study found a strong positive relationship between employee wellbeing, firm performance, and stock performance,;,; A [study](https://wellbeing.hmc.ox.ac.uk/papers/wp-2304-workplace-wellbeing-and-firm-performance/) analysed data on firm performance (return on assets, gross profit, and company valuation) and data from Indeed on work/employee wellbeing, which was a survey about stress, satisfication, happinness, and purpose at work. The study found a strong positive relationship was found between employee wellbeing, return on assets, gross profit, company valuation, and stock performance. Relevant graphs: [https://imgur.com/a/k4YiCPG](https://imgur.com/a/k4YiCPG).  The study also used employee happiness data from Indeed between October 2019 and February 2020 (pre-COVID) to predict firm performance during 2020 and 2021 and found that employee happiness predicted future firm performance.  The study analysed the impact of employee wellbeing on firm performance for 5 industries:  * services * finance, insurance, and real estate * wholesale and trade * transportation and public utilties * manufacturing  Agriculture, mining, and construction were not analysed due to an insufficient sample size. Employee wellbeing had a positive effect for the services, finance, insurance, real estate, and manufacturing industries, with the largest positive effect occurring for the services industry. For wholesale, trade, transportation, and public utilties, the effects were mostly insignificant. Though, due to the smaller sample size when broken down by industry, the study mentioned that the industry-specific results were less precise than the other results and should be treated as an exploratory initial analysis.  The study also found that the top 50 and top 100 highest wellbeing companies outperformed the S&amp;P500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones over January 2021 to March 2023, which was the period analysed. The total return of the top 50 was higher than the top 100. The outcomes were the same when they analysed the stock performance of the top 100 companies for stressfree, satisfication, happinness, and purpose individually.  Based on literature, the study discussed 6 potential reasons for these results: productivity, relationships, creativity, health, recruitment, and retention. The discussion is long, so see the study for the full discussion and supporting evidence. For a very brief summary:  * Employee wellbeing was linked to employee performance. Employees with higher wellbeing worked faster, more efficiently, and more effectively. * Happier employees developed more supportive relationships with colleagues and supervisors, demonstrated higher capacities for cooperation and collaboration, had more satisfied and loyal customer, and were better negotiators. * A wide body of research demonstrated the importance of wellbeing in promoting creativity, generally defined as the production of novel and useful ideas. Happier people had greater mental flexibility and broader awareness, thereby enabling them to make sparse connections and generate original ideas. * There was a very strong relationship between wellbeing and health. Poor physical and mental health was linked to reduced work performance primarily due to higher rates of absenteeism and presenteeism. Employees with low job satisfaction have been found to be more likely to leave work early, arrive at work late, and miss days of work entirely. * Jobseekers valued employee wellbeing and avoided firms with poor wellbeing, which impacted the ability of firms to attract talent. A study examined the effects of randomly exposing job seekers to information about company happiness levels on Indeed. The experiment involved more than 23 million job seekers in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, and found that job seekers responded behaviorally to this information, by redirecting their applications away from low happiness companies to happier ones. Much of this effect was driven by job seekers ‚Äúscreening out‚Äù low happiness firms from their job search. In follow-up analyses, the study found that by improving their score, companies could attract more applications from people viewing the company on the platform. * There was a negative relationship between employee wellbeing and turnover. High employee wellbeing predicted lower rates of turnover. Turnover was costly for firms. Estimates of organizational costs associated with turnover from the United States Department of Labor ranged from one half to five times of the workers‚Äô original annual salary. Some of these costs were due to lost productivity, rehiring, retraining, and loss of skill and knowledge \[1\]. The annual turnover/separation rates in 2021 and 2022 were 47% \[2\]\[3\]. In 2019, Gallup estimated US businesses were losing $1 trillion annually due to voluntary turnover \[4\].  The study cited multiple studies for each point, but they only scratched the surface. There was a very large amount of literature on employee wellbeing which basically all supported the relationship between employee wellbeing, productivity, mental health, physical health, turnover, workplace injury, business costs, and etc.  References  1.

[Considering a recession in 2023,;,; New to stock market. I started dabbling in stock market about a year ago, investing roughly 60k into variety of tech stocks. With a recent tech spike I ended up selling my position in Meta(135-240), Amazon(94-122), and Microsoft(240-305). Since everyone is talking about an upcoming recession in the late 2023 would it be wise to wait off to buy back in assuming the market will crash.

[Rinse and repeat?,;,; Hello, I have been investing for last 18 months and i would say I prefer to take low risk rather quick gains. So i invest in well known companies such as apple, amazon but i also have small shares in U, UPST, Confluent.

Question- I hear/read folks suggesting to hold blue chip stocks as eventually they grow but what i have seen seeing is almost all stocks rise, fall to good extent and rise again. Does in this holding long term make sense?  For instance I have $8k in U and its been going through ups and downs and i feel like i‚Äôm missing big opportunity by holding it .,;,; 2023-11-14 03:32:45]

[Should I sell off VFIFX at a loss and move to VOO, VTI, or SPY?,;,; I knew nothing about nothing two years ago when I decided my 401k might not be sufficient and started a Roth. I just put 6k into VFIFX because I figured it'd match closely with my 401k without me needing to think too much.   A year later, I opened a standard brokerage account, spent money on a Bogle book that says, "buy ETFs" for too many pages, and at my next 401k investment moment, bought low on Amazon. That is doing well. As are the ETFs as I moved funds from savings to investment in the standard, but taxable account.   VFIFX is my oldest, and at 6k largest, purchase, and still in the red.

Losses are mostly due to greed and to less extent because of bad entry.After every session i manage to finish with at least 30% profit.

[What Walmart‚Äôs ($WMT) stock split means for the Dow Jones.,;,; Walmart recently announced a 3 for 1 stock split, a significant move considering its status as a major component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Since the Dow is a price-weighted index, this split will decrease Walmart‚Äôs weighting in the index, initiating a rebalance to accommodate the drop in price.  It's intriguing to note that the Dow has been trailing behind the S&amp;P 500 in performance YTD, increasing ~2.6% and ~5.4% respectively.   Potentially prompting the index to consider adding new stocks to compensate for the YTD underperformance.  The last time the Dow underwent a significant change was in August 2020. At that time, Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell were added, while Exxon, Pfizer, and RTX Corp were removed.  Unlike their usual practices, the Dow committee has delayed making changes for an extended period of time, reminiscent of the period from June 2009 to September 2012.  With the Dow undergoing rebalancing, I‚Äôm eyeing potential exits for IBM, Cisco, Intel, Verizon, and Walgreens Boots Alliance.    Additionally, I could see potential additions like Amazon, META, and Eli Lilly who have a wider touch on the economy.

[Walmart lays off hundreds of workers at e-commerce facilities,;,; https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/walmart-lays-off-hundreds-of-workers-at-e-commerce-facilities-.html  Walmart is laying off hundreds of employees at e-commerce facilities across the country, as the big-box giant and other retailers brace for a tougher year ahead.  Walmart, the nation‚Äôs largest private employer, is shrinking its workforce as many retailers plan on roughly flat or declining sales. Inflation and the shift back to services is taking a bite out of sales of goods, particularly after a pandemic-fueled spending boom.  Walmart‚Äôs e-commerce rival, Amazon, announced 9,000 job cuts on Monday, following 18,000 layoffs in January. Amazon has also closed, cancelled and delayed the opening of new warehouses, as some online sales shifted back to stores. Another competitor, Target, plans to cut up to $3 billion in total costs over the next three years, but CFO Michael Fiddelke said at a February investor day that the company is ‚Äúnot backing away from investments in our team and guest experience.‚Äù  A spokesperson for Walmart confirmed it was cutting jobs at fulfillment centers. In a statement, the company said it made the cuts ‚Äúto better prepare for the future needs of customers.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThis decision was not made lightly, and we‚Äôre working closely with affected associates to help them understand what career options may be available at other Walmart locations,‚Äù the statement said.  The news was first reported by Reuters.  The company confirmed to Reuters that it is eliminating hundreds of job cuts at five fulfillment centers, including Pedricktown, N.J.; Fort Worth, Texas; Chino, Calif.; Davenport, Fla.; and Bethlehem, Pa. It told Reuters it was reducing its workforce because of a reduction or elimination in evening and weekend shifts.  About 200 workers will be affected at the southern Jersey facility, according to a notice filed with New Jersey.  Walmart anticipates slower sales growth and lower profits in the coming fiscal year. The company said last month that it expects same-store sales for its U.S. business to grow between 2% and 2.5%, excluding fuel. That compares to 6.6% growth in the previous fiscal year.  The company expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $5.90 to $6.05, excluding fuel, for the fiscal year. That‚Äôs lower than the adjusted earnings per share of $6.29 for the past fiscal year.  Online sales have continued to grow, though at a slower pace than during the peak of the pandemic. E-commerce sales for Walmart‚Äôs U.S. business rose 12% in the most recent fiscal year, which ended Jan. 31. That compares to to 11% growth in fiscal 2022 and 79% in fiscal 2021.,;,; 2023-03-23 18:34:24]
[Snap plunges 25% on revenue miss and light guidance, as Middle East conflict creates ‚Äòheadwind‚Äô,;,; Snap reported revenue that trailed analysts‚Äô estimates on Tuesday and issued a forecast that came in a bit below Wall Street expectations. The stock plunged 20% in extended trading.  Here‚Äôs how the company did:  Earnings per share: 8 cents, adjusted, vs. 6 cents expected by analysts, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.  Revenue: $1.36 billion vs. $1.38 billion expected, according to LSEG.  Global Daily Active Users: 414 million vs. 412 million expected, according to StreetAccount.  Average revenue per user: $3.29 vs. $3.33 expected, according to StreetAccount.   Snap has struggled to rebound from the downturn in the digital ad market, and has now reported six straight quarters of single-digit growth or sales declines. For the fourth quarter, revenue rose about 5% year-over-year to $1.36 billion from $1.3 billion a year earlier.  For the second consecutive period, Snap attributed some of the weakness to the war in the Middle East, which erupted in October beginning with Hamas‚Äôs attack on Israel.  ‚ÄúWhile we are encouraged by the progress we are making with our ad platform and the improved results we are delivering for many of our advertising partners, we estimate that the onset of the conflict in the Middle East was a headwind to year-over-year growth of approximately 2 percentage points in Q4,‚Äù Snap said in a letter to investors.  Growth is expected to accelerate in the first quarter, but not quite as fast as analysts were expecting. Snap forecast sales for the quarter of $1.095 billion to $1.135 billion, representing about 11% growth at the midpoint of the range, which was $1.115 billion. Analysts were looking for revenue of $1.117 billion.  Daily active users for the first quarter will be 420 million, Snap said, slightly topping analyst estimates of 419.3 million.  Earlier this week, Snap said it would cut 10% of its global workforce, which equates to about 500 employees. A company spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that the cuts were intended to reorganize staff and ‚Äúreduce hierarchy and promote in-person collaboration.‚Äù In mid-2022, Snap eliminated about 1,000 employees, or 20% of its fulltime workforce.  Snap‚Äôs net loss for the quarter narrowed to $248.2 million, or 15 cents a share, which represents a 14% year-over-year decrease from $288.5 million, or 18 cents a share.  Snap said it expects an adjusted EBITDA loss between $55 million to $95 million in the first quarter, higher than analyst projections of $21.9 million. Last quarter, Snap issued an ‚Äúinternal forecast‚Äù for the fourth quarter instead of providing official guidance because of ‚Äúthe unpredictable nature of war,‚Äù referring to the Israel-Hamas war.  Snap on Tuesday disclosed sales its its Snapchat+ subscription service for the first time and said it had an annualized revenue run rate of $249 million in 2023. The service now has 7 million subscribers, up from five million in the previous quarter. Snap introduced the product in 2022, pitching it as a way for users to access early features. It came debuted that summer for $3.99 a month.  Snap‚Äôs growth in the fourth quarter lagged larger digital ad rivals like Meta, Amazon and Alphabet, which all reported double-digit expansion in their advertising units.  Snap and Pinterest are ‚Äúmuch smaller companies that have struggled to build substantial ad businesses, Debra Aho Williamson, an industry analyst, told CNBC. ‚ÄúIn this environment, the big are getting bigger,‚Äù  Last week, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel attended a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on child safety and technology alongside Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,  X CEO Linda Yaccarino, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and Discord CEO Jason Citron. Lawmakers grilled the executives, accusing them of failing to properly safeguard their respective platforms from child predators, among other concerns.

[Apple opens its first store in India as it looks for a new generation of iPhone users,;,; [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/apple-opens-first-store-in-india-in-iphone-sales-manufacturing-push.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/apple-opens-first-store-in-india-in-iphone-sales-manufacturing-push.html)  [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) on Tuesday opened its first store in India, highlighting the importance of the market to the iPhone maker‚Äôs future.  The first store, called Apple BKC, is located in the populous city of Mumbai. Apple on Thursday will open another store in the capital of Delhi.  The Cupertino giant said it has been present in India for more than 25 years.  ‚ÄúIndia has such a beautiful culture and an incredible energy, and we‚Äôre excited to build on our long-standing history,‚Äù Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a press release published Monday.  Cook posted a photo of himself and staff at the new apple store on Monday.  Apple is aiming to boost sales and manufacturing of iPhones in India in a move analysts say resembles its strategy when it first entered China, now one of the company‚Äôs biggest markets.  Apple claims its Mumbai store is ‚Äúone of the most energy-efficient‚Äù locations in the world and has a dedicated solar energy system and has zero reliance on fossil fuels for the store‚Äôs operations. Apple BKC runs on 100% renewable energy, Apple said.  Cook has long viewed India as a key market to Apple‚Äôs future and in February he said he was ‚Äúbullish‚Äù on the world‚Äôs fifth-largest economy and the company is putting a ‚Äúsignificant amount of energy‚Äù into the market. Cook traveled to India for the opening of the store, [nearly seven years after his first visit as Apple CEO](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/19/here-are-the-challenges-apples-tim-cook-faces-on-his-india-trip.html).  India‚Äôs smartphone market, however, has been dominated in recent years by Samsung and Chinese brands such as [Xiaomi](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/1810-HK/), with low-to-mid-tier priced devices finding support from customers in a price-sensitive market. Apple has very little market share in India.  But India is undergoing a ‚Äúpremiumification of market,‚Äù according to Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research. Smartphones priced above $400 now account for 10% of the total volumes of handsets shipped versus 4% before the pandemic, according to Shah. He said this category of smartphones accounts for 35% of total smartphone market revenue.  ‚ÄúApple as usual has got the timing right on ‚Äòpeaking at the right time‚Äô with its flagship store strategy to catalyse this trend in its favour,‚Äù Shah told CNBC via email.  India has a growing middle class, a young and ‚Äúmobile first‚Äù population willing to pay more for phones, especially in Mumbai and Delhi, two of the country‚Äôs wealthiest cities and the location of the new Apple stores.  ## iPhone sales in focus  Apple‚Äôs India push offers the opportunity for the U.S. technology giant to boost revenue and iPhone sales near the levels seen in markets like the U.S. and China, analysts said.  Apple shipped about 6.5 million iPhones in India in 2022, compared to around 50 million each year in both the U.S. and China, according to Counterpoint Research. Shah said India ‚Äúhas the potential to reach that scale‚Äù in the coming years.  Shipments refer to the iPhones Apple sends to retailers but do not equal sales. However, it is an indicator of the demand for iPhones in a country.  Apple made $6 billion in revenue in the year through to March, growing 50%, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter.  Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said that could rise further over the next two years.  ‚ÄúApple is now aggressively looking at India from both a production and retail expansion over the coming years that we believe will be a strategic poker move for Cupertino that could ramp annual revenue to $20 billion by 2025 in India,‚Äù Ives said in a note published Tuesday.  But it‚Äôs not just about selling iPhones. Apple‚Äôs strategy over the years has involved getting users locked into its suite of products including the Apple Watch and services like Apple Music.  ‚ÄúApple can cross sell other products such as Macs, Watch, AirPods, iPads and services to the growing iPhone user base maximising the revenue opportunity,‚Äù Shah said.  ## Manufacturing push  For Apple, India also represents a key part of its manufacturing strategy for the future.  Apple¬†[began assembling its flagship iPhone 14 in India](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/26/apple-starts-manufacturing-the-iphone-14-in-india.html)¬†last year ‚Äî the first time that the company has produced its latest device in the country, so close to its initial launch. Piyush Goyal, India‚Äôs minister of commerce and industry,¬†said in January that Apple is aiming to make 25% of all of its iPhones in India.  Part of the move in India is tied to the government‚Äôs push to bring high-tech manufacturing to the country. But Apple is also trying to diversify its assembly of products away from China. Supply chain fragilities in the world‚Äôs second-largest economy were exposed during the Covid pandemic and the strict measures Beijing took to control the outbreak.  [Production was disrupted](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/06/apple-warns-covid-restrictions-in-china-are-hurting-iphone-production-.html)¬†last year at Apple‚Äôs biggest iPhone factory, located in Zhengzhou, China, by a [Covid outbreak](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/26/apples-iphone-plant-in-china-run-by-foxconn-hit-with-covid-outbreak.html)¬†and¬†[worker protests](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/29/iphone-maker-foxconn-entices-workers-in-china-to-return-after-unrest.html). That factory is run by the Taiwanese firm Foxconn.  Wedbush‚Äôs Ives said Apple‚Äôs India strategy ‚Äî with both a retail and manufacturing push ‚Äî mirrors the technology giant‚Äôs steps it took in the China market 10 years ago.  ‚ÄúAs Foxconn/Apple put more skin in the game on the iPhone production front within India this will go hand in hand with a bigger retail presence within India as seen this week which mirrors the early days of the China penetration strategy going back a decade,‚Äù Iva said.  ‚ÄúRome was not built overnight and neither will Apple‚Äôs broader India strategy, however, we view this week as Apple diving into the deep end of the pool in India as this massive market slowly converts into the Apple ecosystem over the coming years with iPhone market share gains front and center.‚Äù,;,; 2023-04-18 14:24:41]
[Google parent Alphabet‚Äôs stock hit with two downgrades this week,;,; In his research note, Shmulik said Alphabet‚Äôs ‚Äúnarrative has caught up with the fundamentals.‚Äù In other words, the stock is priced to match the company‚Äôs current performance and outlook. He also raised concerns about the way market sentiment went negative on the company after OpenAI announced ChatGPT in Nov. 2022 only to turn positive when the tech titan debuted its own generative AI software in May.        ‚ÄúWhat do we imagine would happen then, in any of the next 2-4 quarters, if Google Search numbers were to come in 'soft'? We imagine investors may once again ring the alarm bells around AI-related risks to Google's Search moat,‚Äù Shmulik wrote.  The analysts also pointed to Google‚Äôs Search Generative Experience (SGE) as a potential headwind for the company‚Äôs search advertising business. SGE is Google‚Äôs experimental generative AI-powered search platform. Like Microsoft‚Äôs Bing, it uses generative AI to provide users with answers to specific queries. The problem, the analysts say, is that the generative AI responses occupy screen space that is currently used to serve ads on the normal Google Search page.  ‚ÄúWe recognize that \[Google‚Äôs\] SGE roll-out is still in its very early stages (limited beta in the US only), with the integration of ads still being figured out,‚Äù Walmsley wrote in a research note. ‚ÄúBut our initial testing of SGE shows material changes to \[search engine results page\] vs. the ‚Äòold‚Äô Google‚Ä¶which we see as demonstrative of the potential disruption to Google's well-oiled Search monetization machine.‚Äù        Google is also increasingly facing challenges from the likes of Meta and Amazon in the digital advertising space. TikTok is also quickly playing a larger role in the industry. Increased spending on generative AI technologies could also cut into Alphabet‚Äôs margins.        The company is also staring down a slew of regulatory challenges including calls by the European Union‚Äôs European Commission to break up Google‚Äôs massive advertising business, which the commission says violates antitrust laws.,;,; 2023-06-28 10:09:27]

[Fallen post IPO stocks, which may have hidden gems potential,;,; Some analysis from my site of new and innovative companies, which received massive media attention and hype in the last years. But after hype is gone, many of these stocks has significantly fallen in their prices, especially those that went public in the last two to three years. Nevertheless, in my opinios we have some hidden gems here, which may be worth a look at right now:  **Bumble: A Bumpy Ride for the Dating App Giant**  Bumble, a well-known dating app with additional features, has experienced a significant 77% decline in its stock since its IPO. While its revenue growth has been solid but not outstanding, with a 16% increase in the last quarter, the company's profitability has seen a slight decline but has shown signs of improvement. With a market capitalization of $2.3 billion and a price-to-sales ratio of around 2.5, the current valuation appears attractive, presenting a potential buying opportunity after the initial hype during the IPO was considered unjustified. Investors may find Bumble worth a second look given the current lack of interest in the stock.  **Rivian: The "Tesla Killer" Faces Tough Competition**  Rivien, known as the "Tesla Killer," has gathered significant media attention for its electric vehicles, especially pickup trucks and SUVs with unique headlights. Despite the initial hype, the stock has plummeted by 88% since its IPO. Ford and Amazon were major investors, but the relationship with Amazon soured, leading Rivien to terminate its exclusive supply contract.  As a young company, Rivien's latest quarterly numbers show impressive revenue growth of 600%, primarily due to minimal revenue in the previous year. The company is now delivering significant quantities of cars, totaling 8,000 in the current quarter, and aims to achieve a gross profit in 2024 while targeting over 50,000 vehicle deliveries in 2023. With a cash cushion of nearly $12 billion, Rivien's market capitalization stands at $14.2 billion.  Considering the current revenue growth, Rivien's value seems attractive, but it's crucial to acknowledge the uncertainty surrounding its future. The revenue-to-sales ratio is not representative at this stage. Investors who believe in Rivien as a serious automaker may find the company's valuation worthy of respect. However, the stock remains speculative due to ongoing uncertainties and market speculation.  **Didi: The Struggles of a Ride-Hailing Giant in China**  Didi, a ride-hailing company with food delivery services, has experienced an 80% decline in stock value since its IPO. Revenue growth has been inconsistent due to COVID-19 impact and regulatory challenges in China. Despite a recent data scandal and a $1.2 billion fine, Didi's market capitalization is $14.5 billion, less than one times its revenue of $19 billion. A potential China comeback may make the stock appealing, but it carries increased risk.  **Marqeta: A Hidden Gem in the Fintech Industry**  Marqeta, a fintech company serving the B2B sector with payment and card solutions, has seen an 84% decline in stock value since its IPO. Revenue growth has been impressive, with a 31% increase in the last quarter, leading to improved profitability. Currently, Marqeta's market capitalization stands at $2.6 billion, with revenue reaching $800 million, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of approximately 3.3. Considering the strong 30% growth, the current valuation appears exciting and remarkably inexpensive. However, the stock was evidently overvalued at its IPO, given its current financial performance.  **Palantir: The Profitability Puzzle**  Palantir, a well-known data analysis software firm, has seen a 66% increase in its stock since IPO, achieving near profitability in the last two quarters. While revenue growth was solid at 18%, the market capitalization stands at $33 billion, 17 times its revenue of $2 billion. This valuation is deemed very high, considering moderate profitability and an 18% growth rate.  **Coupang: The South Korean Amazon**  Coupang, a dominant player in South Korea's 24-hour delivery and e-commerce market, has seen a 60% decline in stock value since IPO. Despite stable growth and a 20% currency-adjusted growth rate in the latest quarter, profitability has surged by 36%, with a positive EBITDA of $241 million. With a market capitalization of $31 billion and revenue of $21 billion, the stock's current valuation is just 1.5 times its revenue, making it an attractive deal. Considering a potential strong comeback in South Korea, the stock deserves a second look.  **Snowflake: A Hyped Cloud-Based Software Service**  Snowflake, a cloud-based software service company, is shaping the market and expects exponential growth. Despite a 25% decline since IPO, its latest quarterly numbers were strong, with a 47% revenue increase and positive earnings per share. The net revenue retention remains high at 151%, but a downward trend is evident. With a market capitalization of $55 billion and revenue of $2.2 billion, the stock's current valuation is 25 times its revenue, considered astronomically high. The hype surrounding Snowflake's partnerships with Microsoft and Nvidia attracts investors, but caution is advised as market interest may eventually calm down.  **Coinbase: Riding the Cr\*ptocurrency Rollercoaster**  Coinbase, a cryptocurrency platform, experienced a significant decline since its IPO, currently standing at -76% from the offering price. The decreasing interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, has impacted Coinbase's trading volume and revenue, which almost halved since the beginning of 2022. Despite managing to improve profitability, Coinbase still operates at a negative margin. The current market capitalization is $17 billion with revenue of $2.8 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of over 6, which isn't considered cheap. As the market largely depends on the price of B\*tcoin and cr\*pto trading volume, Coinbase is viewed as a speculative investment, and direct investment in Bitcoin might yield better results, especially during downward phases.  **GitLab: A Promising Business Model**  GitLab, a DevOps platform solution, has experienced a decline of 56% since its IPO. Despite this, the company's business development has been promising, with pleasing revenue and profitability trends. GitLab follows a software-as-a-service subscription model, charging per user per month. The current market capitalization is $7 billion with revenue of $460 million, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of approximately 15. While the numbers are good, the high valuation may not be fully justified yet. However, the positive business trajectory indicates potential for further stock growth.  **DoorDash: Strong Growth with Uncertain Profitability**  DoorDash, a food delivery service, has experienced a decline of 56% since its IPO. Despite this, the company has shown strong revenue growth, averaging around 40% in recent quarters, and provided a slight surprise in earnings per share. The current market capitalization is $29 billion with revenue of $7.1 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of 4. However, DoorDash is yet to achieve profitability, and the path to break-even remains unclear. Although restaurant food prices have increased by around 25%, DoorDash still faces challenges in reaching profitability. As such, investors may be cautious until a clear path to profitability emerges.  **Roblox: Targeting a Young Audience**  Roblox, an online game platform targeting a young audience, has seen a 42% decline in its stock since its IPO. Revenue growth has been stagnant, influenced by pandemic effects, and losses have significantly widened, reaching approximately $270 million per quarter. Despite this, Roblox has a high market valuation of $23 billion with revenue of $2.3 billion, resulting in a stock price ten times higher than its revenue. This valuation is considered expensive, especially considering the increased losses and minimal growth, as the company relies on the purchasing power of parents of its young target audience. As a result, investors may view Roblox as a risky investment at its current valuation.  **UiPath: Robotics in Process Automation**  UiPath, a company specializing in robotic process automation (RPA), has seen a significant decline of nearly 74% in its stock since its IPO. However, its revenue has almost doubled since going public, and the retention rate remains high at 22%. The latest quarterly numbers were positive, with growth and earnings per share surpassing expectations. Currently, UiPath's market capitalization is just under $10 billion with revenue of $1.1 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of 8.6, which is not considered cheap. UiPath faces competition from other players like Microsoft in the RPA and process automation space, which adds to the competitive landscape. While the company's financial performance shows promise, investors may be cautious about its valuation and the competitive challenges it faces.  **Toast: A Savory Deal for Restaurant Operators**  Toast, a specialized software solution for the restaurant sector, has experienced a decline of -60% in its stock value since its IPO. However, the company's financials show positive signs. It has achieved steady growth with a robust 53% revenue increase in the first quarter of 2023. The revenue sources include hardware sales, subscription model fees, and other channels for restaurant operators. Toast's profitability has also improved significantly, with the negative adjusted EBITDA nearly halving in recent quarters. Currently, the stock has a market capitalization of $11 billion with revenue of $3 billion, resulting in a price-to-sales ratio of 4, which is considered an attractive valuation given the current growth rate. The company's ingenious business model that covers various aspects of the restaurant business makes it promising for potential investors despite its recent stock decline.  **Affirm: Stagnation in the "Buy Now, Pay Later" Space**  Affirm, a fintech company providing "buy now, pay later" solutions to online retailers, has experienced a 57% decline in its stock value since its mid-2021 IPO. The company's revenue has remained relatively stagnant in recent quarters, with no significant growth. Similar trends are observed with competitors like Mollie, Afterpay, and Zip, indicating a stagnant market. Due to the lack of growth and increasing profits, the current valuation is deemed too expensive, and the stock does not present many investment opportunities.  &amp;#x200B;  **Summary**  In conclusion, this analysis highlights the rollercoaster ride of IPO hype, with some stocks failing to fullfill the expectations, while others offer hidden gems potential. For me personaly: Toast and Coupang stand out as promising stocks with strong financials. Let me know your thoughts on this summary and your personal "hidden gems".  &amp;#x200B;  And of course as always: This is not a financial advice and im not a financial advisor. All investements carry some form of a risk. Nothing is guaranteed.,;,; 2023-07-24 07:39:22]

[(not)survivor bias,;,; To those who have been in the market for a while, what are some companies that haven't achieved success, yet say more than 10 years ago everyone thought they would be great companies?   Apologies if the title does not fit quite right. My thoughts are for every Microsoft there are a number of other software companies that did not make it big yet seemed to be poised to lead the pack. For every Amazon, there are other e-commmerce companies which might have been equally as good if not better that didn't make it.   Here I do not mean the companies that didn't necessarily make sense (selling the ability to send scents over the Internet or beanie babies that were hyped by a bubble). More like say AOL and how it lost search to Google kind of companies that you might know.  Thank you,;,; 2023-09-26 20:59:26]
[Nikola's fourth-quarter revenue falls short as it delivers just 20 trucks,;,; https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/23/nikola-nkla-q4-2022-results.html  Electric heavy-truck maker Nikola said Thursday it produced 133 battery-electric trucks in the fourth quarter, but delivered just 20 to dealers, generating revenue that fell well short of Wall Street‚Äôs expectations.  Nikola said it made a series of changes to its battery-electric truck during the quarter in response to feedback from early customers. The company also confirmed that the fuel-cell version of its truck is still on track to begin production in the second half of 2023, in line with earlier guidance.  The stock fell more than 5% Thursday.  Here are the key numbers from Nikola‚Äôs fourth-quarter earnings report, compared with Refinitiv consensus estimates:  Adjusted loss per share: 37 cents vs. 43 cents expected  Revenue: $6.6 million vs. $32.1 million expected  Nikola‚Äôs fourth-quarter net loss was $222.1 million, or 46 cents per share. The truck maker lost $159.4 million, or 39 cents per share on a GAAP basis, in the year-ago period.  As of Dec. 31, Nikola had $233.4 million in cash and equivalents available, down from $315.7 million at the end of September.  Nikola‚Äôs fourth-quarter production brought it to 258 trucks built in 2022. That was just enough to hit the guidance range it provided in November, when it said it expected to produce between 255 and 305 trucks for the full year.  Production should ramp up somewhat in 2023. Nikola said investors should expect it to deliver between 250 and 350 battery-electric trucks and 125 to 150 of its upcoming fuel-cell trucks this year. The company also expects to reduce costs on its battery-electric trucks by about $105,000 per truck by year-end as it realizes savings from its acquisition of battery-pack maker Romeo Power.,;,; 2023-02-23 21:24:12]
[Funding IRAs through selling covered calls,;,; I left a job last year and rolled over both my Traditional &amp; Roth IRAs.

[Microsoft earnings are out ‚Äì here are the numbers,;,; Microsoft reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.  Here are the key numbers to follow:  Earnings: $2.69 a share. That may not compare with the $2.55 cents per share expected by Refinitiv.  Revenue:  $56.19 billion. That may not compare with the $55.47 billion expected by Refinitiv.  Based on analysts‚Äô projections, Microsoft will close fiscal 2023 with revenue growth below 10% for the first time since 2017. Growth for the latest quarter is expected to come in at around 7%. Businesses have been delaying cloud and software deployments since last year due to economic uncertainty and the potential for higher interest rates.  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees in May that the company won‚Äôt lift salaries this year.  Analysts polled by CNBC and by StreetAccount expect Microsoft to report about 25% year-over-year growth in revenue from the Azure public cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. Microsoft doesn‚Äôt report Azure revenue in dollars. The projected growth rate is similar to what analysts expect from Google‚Äôs cloud division. Parent company Alphabet also reports results after the bell on Tuesday.  During the quarter, Microsoft built on its broad alliance with OpenAI to capitalize on fresh interest in artificial intelligence, following the November launch of the startup‚Äôs ChatGPT chatbot. Microsoft introduced a chatbot powered partly by OpenAI language models to help workers make sense of their employers‚Äô data, and it told developers they‚Äôll be able to build plugins that people can access through ChatGPT, the Bing search engine‚Äôs chatbot, and other tools.  Investors are eager for resolution in Microsoft‚Äôs arrangement to buy Activision Blizzard for almost $69 billion, which was agreed upon in January 2022. Earlier this month, an appeals court denied the Federal Trade Commission‚Äôs motion to stop the transaction. Activision shares have climbed past $92.50, close to the $95 that Microsoft agreed to pay, reflecting optimism that the deal is on track to close.  Microsoft shares have gained 44% year to date, while the S&amp;P 500 is up 19%.  In June, Microsoft said it expected to take a $425 million charge in the quarter to pay a fine from Ireland‚Äôs Data Protection Commission after the authority looked at whether the company‚Äôs LinkedIn unit violated the European Union‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation.  Executives will discuss the quarterly results with analysts and issue guidance on a conference call starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.

[Question about Shares,;,; I've sat on this question for a while, so here goes:  What happens if a company like Amazon wants to dissolve or their stocks begin to drop?  Is it just a guaranteed disaster? That is, without the help of a bailbout?   Is their a known point on the way down, where people eventually can't sell their shares, as nobody is buying them?   If that happens, what is the next move for the shareholders &amp; the company?   I know that the stock market is a lot more fragile than many of us are lead to believe, seeing as almost everybody relies on this system to retire, in some way or another, whether it's through 401k's, Social Security, Savings Accounts, or running a business yourself that's on the stock exchange, but I need answers to this question. If what happens is what I think happens, then this is impossible to keep working fluently, and is bound to fall apart at some point.   (Also, I know that bailouts are borrowed from different agencies, including social security, and we already know that's not sustainable, due to the governments national debt climbing consistently for the past 30 years),;,; 2023-12-17 05:23:19]
[Good time to buy RIVN?,;,; I have yet to do a deep due diligence on the company, but there are three things that make me want to buy  1. The product look good. I've seen these trucks driving around and they look impressive. They also appear to be well designed and have competitive mileage.  2. The company is supported by Amazon, who has sizable equity ownership and an agreement to purchase 100,000 trucks by 2030. This support, I believe, will help keep the company afloat as the company burns money.   3. The stock is trading much more reasonably compared to its IPO. It's down 86%, almost at its 52 week low, and no longer had a market cap greater than Ford or GM.  There are definitely downsides and risks As a startup and an automotive company Rivian will feel pressure as it already has with layoffs. However, it is my belief that because their trucks are so expensive ($75k), their customers will be those in higher income brackets and less susceptible to recession risks, but the auto market I believe has more room to fall. Importantly, the company is burning money with negative operating cash flow.   To anyone who has done more in-depth due diligence, how do you feel about this? Are there any glaring red flags I've missed?,;,; 2023-02-24 20:44:30]

[teslaa delivery analysis based on Q3 deliveries,;,; The top comment on the thread  https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16xxnsa/tsla_q3_deliveries_fall_short/  talks about tesla reducing production due to the upgrade of factories to the new models.  yet I remember it clearly last year it was the discussion that tesla is worth so much more because of how big their backlog is (ie orders placed but not fullfilled yet).  but you can clearly see here: https://insideevs.com/news/679888/estimated-tesla-order-backlog-jul16-2023/  that the order backlog didn't increase in a meneaningful way similar to the lockdown periods / semiconductor shortage.  which means tesla delivered as much as the customers wanted more or less.  I do belive that between:  1. recession in Europe.  2. compatition: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65643064 china becoming the world's top car exporter, japan and gemrany after.  3. chinese market (which used to be the highest growing to the auto industry) is locking out western companies due to trade wars.  4. inflation/reduction in margines.  in my opinion the growth story tesla has sold is running on fume.,;,; 2023-10-04 07:54:10]
[When is it better to hold equal-weighted S&amp;P ETF?,;,;  I have some cash I want to put back into the market. Is it better to buy equal-weighted instead of market-cap weighted S&amp;P 500 ETF? Some reasons why:  * Nvidia's advancements is going to "democratize AI" by making it cheaper. This means smaller companies might be able to displace bigger companies.  * I expect a period of growth in the next 6-12 months due to rate hike pausing. In these type of environments investors are going to move out of the safe tech bets (like Apple, Microsoft) and get back into more speculative, smaller cap names.  * I already hold stocks like Google, Amazon, and a lot of Apple &amp; Tesla. I also wheel stocks like FB and Nvidia, so might get stuck with them as well.  Would love your opinions. Or if you just have general thoughts to share about equal vs market cap weighting, that's great as well.,;,; 2023-06-02 18:34:53]

[Google rebrands Bard AI to Gemini and launches a new app and subscription,;,; Google on Thursday announced a major rebrand of Bard, its artificial intelligence chatbot and assistant, including a fresh app and subscription options. Bard, a chief competitor to OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, is now called Gemini, the same name as the suite of AI models that power the chatbot.  Google also announced new ways for consumers to access the AI tool: As of Thursday, Android users can download a new dedicated Android app for Gemini, and iPhone users can use Gemini within the Google app on iOS.  Google‚Äôs rebrand and app offerings underline the company‚Äôs commitment to pursuing ‚Äî and investing heavily in ‚Äî AI assistants or agents, a term often used to describe tools ranging from chatbots to coding assistants and other productivity tools.  Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the firm‚Äôs commitment to AI during the company‚Äôs Jan. 30 earnings call. Pichai said he eventually wants to offer an AI agent that can complete more and more tasks on a user‚Äôs behalf, including within Google Search, although he said there is ‚Äúa lot of execution ahead.‚Äù Likewise, chief executives at tech giants from Microsoft to Amazon underlined their commitment to building AI agents as productivity tools.  Google‚Äôs Gemini changes are a first step to ‚Äúbuilding a true AI assistant,‚Äù Sissie Hsiao, a vice president at Google and general manager for Google Assistant and Bard, told reporters on a call Wednesday.  Google on Thursday also announced a new AI subscription option, for power users who want access to Gemini Ultra 1.0, Google‚Äôs most powerful AI model. Access costs $19.99 per month through Google One, the company‚Äôs paid storage offering. For existing Google One subscribers, that price includes the storage plans they may already be paying for. There‚Äôs also a two-month free trial available.  Thursday‚Äôs rollouts are available to users in more than 150 countries and territories, but they‚Äôre restricted to the English language for now. Google plans to expand language offerings to include Japanese and Korean soon, as well as other languages.  The Bard rebrand also affects Duet AI, Google‚Äôs former name for the ‚Äúpackaged AI agents‚Äù within Google Workspace and Google Cloud, which are designed to boost productivity and complete simple tasks for client companies including Wayfair, GE, Spotify and Pfizer. The tools will now be known as Gemini for Workspace and Gemini for Google Cloud.  Google One subscribers who pay for the AI ‚Äã‚Äãsubscription will also have access to Gemini‚Äôs assistant capabilities in Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides and Meet, executives told reporters Wednesday. Google hopes to incorporate more context into Gemini from users‚Äô content in Gmail, Docs and Drive.

What do you think the FTC is trying to achieve here? it already lost and it seems like it will lose again don't you think?

[Interest Rate Resistant Sector Specific Inflation,;,; Is the market still pricing in rate cuts as stocks go to record highs?   Are non stock comp workers primed to demand pay increases, as their companies pull in massive profits, and as personal costs continue to heighten?   As stock comped workers continue to accrue more wealth, and lower class continues to take on debt (inc. non forgivable student debt), has there ever been more of a pronounced have and have-not gap?  Will large companies continue to dominate their industry space? Has industry ever been as consolidated as it is today? How many wealthy people do you hear about working for smaller companies? How many smaller companies are left with acquisition and consolidation happening all the time?  Are raised interest rates having any effect on aforementioned large, industry consolidated companies with huge profit margins? As when you own a large slice of the market for essential goods, you can simply raise prices, and they will be paid. Biden admin recently addressed this for the grocery corps. But grocery, shipping, and producers have heavily consolidated in recent years, as have most industries.  With the recent progress of tech, there is big efficiencies gained by industry consolidation. See amazon. But those industries also attain market, employment and regulatory control with their resources. And jobs continue to be "de-skilled" by efficiency and automation, which is used as a reason to keep pay low.   I'm not sure what this all means for the economy or the market. I've been telling everyone for years that it's a strange but incredibly bustling time for US hegemony in the world. I should have believed my own thought in terms of the market. But I tend to skew overly pragmatic.   I did pretty well recently, as my 200 share short @ 230 on Tesla finally started to pay off. It seems like the AI hype is a ticking time bomb. But tech companies like meta are making so much money they can throw billions into speculation plays without a worry. They seem to actually have no choice but to do this.

[Digital Age for Big Oil using Big Tech $HAL &amp; $MSFT ; $AMZN &amp; $BP, $SHEL,;,; [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/How-New-Technology-Will-Disrupt-The-Oil-And-Gas-Industry.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/How-New-Technology-Will-Disrupt-The-Oil-And-Gas-Industry.html)     At a certain point in its lifecycle, every industry faces its moment of reckoning with growing pressure to transform due to factors such as increasing competition, changing consumer preferences, government policy and other secular headwinds. The transformation usually takes the shape of improved supply chain discipline as well as streamlining business operations in order to achieve better operating margins.  For the oil and¬†[natural gas](https://oilprice.com/admin/articles/Energy/Natural-Gas/Natural-Gas-A-Comprehensive-Guide-To-The-Worlds-Most-Crucial-Fuel.html)¬†industry, the moment of truth arrived a few years ago after years of weak benchmark prices, shrinking margins and massive capital flight forced the sector to seriously rethink the way it does business with energy companies increasingly turning toward tech heavyweights for help in cutting costs and streamlining operations.¬†  A good case in point is¬†[a partnership](https://www.hartenergy.com/news/halliburton-teams-advance-digital-capabilities-microsoft-accenture-188653)¬†struck between¬†**Haliburton Co.**¬†(NYSE:HAL),¬†**Microsoft Inc.**¬†(NASDAQ:MSFT) and¬†**Accenture Plc.**¬†(NYSE:ACN) in 2020. For years, Haliburton, one of the world‚Äôs largest oilfield services companies, has been plagued by shrinking margins and chronic underperformance. The company eventually made a deal with the two cloud giants to migrate its existing data centers to cloud and enhance digital offerings.   Halliburton is hardly alone.  After years of dilly-dallying, oil and gas companies are now rapidly moving their IT infrastructure out to the Cloud as well as adopting Business Process Management (BPM) systems. This frequently results in a leaner, more agile organizational model whilst delivering significant cost savings.  Barclays estimates that the upstream market digital services industry will grow from less than $5 billion in 2020 to a more than $30 billion annual tab by 2025, thus enabling $150 billion in annual savings for oil producers. Opportunities for cost savings include cutting capital expenditures (capex) as well as selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) costs and transportation operating costs.  According to Barclays, the digital age is finally dawning for the energy sector with the market poised to erupt over the next five years. Over the past few years, Microsoft has struck cloud partnerships with several Big Oil companies including¬†**ExxonMobil**¬†(NYSE:XOM),¬†**Chevron Inc**. (NYSE:CVX) and Haliburton while Google‚Äôs parent company¬†**Alphabet Inc.**¬†(NASDAQ:GOOG)[¬†has significantly expanded](https://www.slb.com/newsroom/press-release/2019/pr-2019-0513-slb-google-cloud)¬†its partnership with¬†**Schlumberger Ltd.**¬†(NYSE:SLB), another oilfield services giant. Meanwhile,¬†**Amazon Inc.**¬†(NASDAQ:AMZN) offers digital services to the industry through Amazon Web Services[¬†oil and gas division](https://aws.amazon.com/), and counts¬†**BP Plc**. (NYSE:BP) and¬†**Shell Plc**¬†(NYSE:SHEL) among its top clients.     In many cases, Big Oil‚Äôs digital makeover is quite extensive.  For instance, Halliburton kicked off multiple digital transformation projects during the pandemic. Thailand‚Äôs PTT Exploration and Production and Kuwait Oil Company were among the notable oil and gas companies that were awarded Halliburton contracts to implement digital transformation and enhance efficiency and production at their oilfields.¬†  For years, Big Oil has been using tech companies‚Äô enterprise software in their highly complex operating systems--including¬† rig management operations and precise drilling techniques. However, they have traditionally been somewhat reluctant to hand over their treasure troves of valuable data mainly on cyber security concerns as well as the need to maintain competitive advantages, preferring instead to develop most of their software developed in-house or by companies within the oilfield services sector such as Haliburton.¬†  However, this is now changing as they look for ways to improve operational efficiencies in a bid to squeeze higher cash flows and profits from their existing operations.¬†  Is the new approach working? The evidence seems to suggest so, with shale drilling costs on an encouraging downtrend.¬†**J.P. Morgan**¬†estimates that Permian's Delaware Basin oil drillers now require oil prices of just \~$33/bbl to break even down from $40/bbl in 2019.¬†,;,; 2023-04-03 21:37:36]

[2 e-commerce stocks that could help make you a fortune,;,;  The growth is beyond comparison with these e-commerce stocks, which could add up to big returns for investors.  However, the internet has made e-commerce a game for many players -- not just Amazon and the other big names. Here I want to examine two companies that might be lesser-known names today, but could be big names many years from now:   **Shopify** **($SHOP -0.19%)** and **MercadoLibre** **($MELI 0.49%)**.   ## 1. Shopify  When I think of e-commerce, Shopify immediately comes to mind. The company offers a web and mobile platform that allows businesses to market and sell their products online.  Few companies experienced as big of a pandemic-fueled boom as Shopify -- and for obvious reasons. In many locations, physical stores were shut down or forced to operate with restrictions. As businesses flocked to Shopify, shares surged. Yet, as the pandemic wound to a close, so did investor interest in Shopify. At its low ebb, shares had fallen roughly 70% from their all-time high.  There are, however, many reasons to be optimistic about Shopify's future. For one thing, e-commerce isn't going anywhere. Some estimates place the current e-commerce market at over $5.5 trillion, likely to grow to $8 trillion by 2026.  What's more, Shopify's revenue continues to expand -- albeit at a slower rate. Shopify recorded $5.6 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, with quarterly revenue growing 26% year over year. That's down from the astronomical 90%-plus growth seen during the pandemic, but that absurd growth rate was never sustainable in the long run anyway.  ## 2. MercadoLibre  Based in Uruguay, MercadoLibre operates several e-commerce and payment platforms. The company is something like a combination of **Amazon**, **eBay**, and **Paypal** rolled into one and crowned with a Latin American flair.  At any rate, MercadoLibre's revenue has soared as the Latin-American e-commerce market has hit its stride. Revenue has skyrocketed from $1.3 billion five years ago to $10.5 billion today; quarterly revenue growth has averaged an eye-popping 58%.What's more, Wall Street sees more growth ahead. Analysts predict revenue to climb 24% this year and next, with 2024 revenue expected to top $16 billion. Income, too, has been on the upswing. Unprofitable as recently as 2021, MercadoLibre's net income now stands at $482 million over the last 12 months.  Accordingly, the stock's valuation has improved markedly over the same period. MercadoLibre's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is now 130. That's still high, but less than half of what it was a year ago.,;,; 2023-04-27 09:21:18]

[Apple wins bid to pause Apple Watch ban at US appeals court,;,; Apple scored a victory on Wednesday when a U.S. appeals court paused a government commission's import ban on some of the company's popular Apple smartwatches following a patent dispute with medical-technology firm Masimo.  The tech giant had filed an emergency request asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to halt the order after appealing the U.S. International Trade Commission's (ITC) decision that it had infringed Masimo's patents.  Masimo declined to comment on the court's decision, while Apple did not immediately respond.  A final decision could cost either company millions of dollars and potentially force a settlement or some kind of technological workaround by Apple, analysts said.  Masimo shares were down almost 4% following the decision, and Apple shares were largely flat.  "This is a big win for Apple that was unexpected by many given the legal issues involved in this patent battle," Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said. "Masimo now has a big fight ahead. We expect an appeals case in January to be a big moment."  In a four-paragraph ruling, the appeals court said it would halt the ban while it considers Apple's motion for a longer-term pause during the appeals process. The court gave the ITC until Jan. 10 to respond to Apple's request.  U.S. President Joe Biden's administration declined to veto the ban on Tuesday, allowing it to take effect. Apple asked for a pause of the ban later that day.  On Tuesday, Apple told the court that U.S. Customs and Border Protection is considering whether redesigned versions of its watches infringe Masimo's patents and can be imported. The customs agency has set a target date of Jan. 12 for its decision, Apple said.  Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and incorporating it into Apple Watches.  The ITC barred imports and sales of Apple Watches with technology for reading blood-oxygen levels. Apple has included a pulse oximeter feature in its smartwatches starting with its Series 6 model in 2020.  Apple can also now sell the Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches in the U.S., after pausing sales last week due to the ITC decision. The watches had remained available at other retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, Costco and Walmart.  The ban did not affect the Apple Watch SE, a less-expensive model without a pulse oximeter. Previously sold watches also were not be affected by the ban.  If the import ban remains in place, it could cost Apple from high hundreds of millions of dollars to very low billions of dollars, Ben Bajarin, CEO of analyst firm Creative Strategies, said before the decision was announced.  "Going forward, it's absolutely certain they are going to have to take a different approach in future hardware to still enable this feature," he said of Apple.  A jury trial on Masimo's allegations against Apple in California federal court ended with a mistrial in May. Apple has separately sued Masimo for patent infringement in federal court in Delaware and called Masimo's legal actions a "maneuver to clear a path" for its own competing smartwatch.  Apple's wearables, home and accessory business, which includes the Apple Watch, AirPods earbuds and other products, brought in $8.28 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2023, according to a company report.  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-wins-bid-pause-apple-163531965.html,;,; 2023-12-27 18:17:36]

["Is the AI-led 'F*cking Baby Bubble' Bursting? BofA Says Tech Stocks Just Saw Their Biggest Outflow in 10 Weeks.",;,; The current AI-led "baby bubble" could be seen as a positive or a negative depending on the perspective. On the one hand, it is a sign of progress and innovation, with technology giants such as Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla leading the way. The stock prices of these companies have boomed this year, suggesting that investors are bullish on the future of AI.  On the other hand, there are some who are warning that the investor hype for AI could be short-lived and that the market could be heading for a significant correction. Bank of America's Michael Hartnett has compared the current AI boom to the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s, where the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 78%. UBS's Art Cashin and veteran economist David Rosenberg have also drawn parallels with the dot-com bubble.  Ultimately, it is difficult to know for sure whether the AI-led "baby bubble" will burst or if it will continue to grow and drive the stock market higher. It is important to remember that, while AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, it is still a relatively new technology and there is a lot of uncertainty and risk associated with investing in AI-related stocks. As such, it is important for investors to do their due diligence and be aware of the potential downsides before investing in AI stocks.  (https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-led-baby-bubble-bursting-020103566.html)  What lessons can be learned from the dot-com bubble that could be applied to the current AI stock boom?,;,; 2023-06-24 03:11:03]
[How US stocks rose 20% from their lows, and where they might be going,;,; U.S. stocks have defied fears of a recession, a banking crisis and soaring Treasury yields to rise 20% from their October lows - one definition of a bull market.        The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index closed at a low of 3,577.03 on Oct. 12, 2022, down 25% from its all-time high after the Federal Reserve unleashed a series of bruising interest rate increases to fight decades-high inflation.        On Thursday, it closed up 0.6% at 4,293.93, amid growing optimism over the economic outlook and a rate hiking cycle that appears to be nearing its end. Here are some features of the index's rally, and a look at where stocks might go from here.  While markets seldom rise in a straight line, the S&amp;P 500's journey from the bottom took 164 days - the longest 20% climb from a bear market low in five decades. Among the factors holding stocks back was a surge in Treasury yields to their highest levels in decades that dulled the allure of equities by offering investors the potential to earn attractive income in government-backed bonds.        A crisis that saw the biggest bank busts since the Great Recession also shook investor confidence, as did worries over a potentially catastrophic fight over lifting the U.S. debt ceiling.  The narrow breadth of the S&amp;P 500's rally has been a concern for some investors, with just seven stocks - Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) - responsible for almost all of the index's gains this year. Many investors view these stocks as safe bets in uncertain times. Their gains were also driven by excitement over advances in artificial intelligence.  More recently, however, the market's gains have shown tentative signs of broadening out to other stocks.  Meanwhile, volatility has subsided - not only in stocks, but in Treasuries and currencies.        One reason for the calm in markets is investors' belief that the Fed is unlikely to deliver many more of the rate hikes that shook asset prices last year.        Investors have also been encouraged by evidence showing that the U.S. economy continues to be resilient in the face of the central bank's monetary tightening, while inflation slowly cools. The U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (.CESIUSD) shows U.S. economic data has in aggregate topped market expectations, helped by stronger than expected numbers for employment and consumer spending.        A 20% gain from bear market lows has in the past heralded further upside for stocks.  In four of the last six bear markets, the S&amp;P went on to rise 20% or more in the six months after hitting this milestone.

[600 AMZN 09/15/2023 100.00 C finally guessed the Call went to an EU market.

Not when Amzn went above $100, not at 115, not  at any time.   I finally figured out the option apparently went to a European market which only allowed the option to be exercised on the last day. I didn't even understand that was possible.  Now, I'm looking at the option coming due, at $100 when the stock is selling at $142.  I'm thinking of just rolling it out again, but how do I ensure it will be sold again on the European market instead of it being exercised here in the American market?

[Selling really deep ITM covered calls with low cost basis,;,; I wanted to run this by the sub to see if I'm missing something here. I run the wheel strategy pretty successfully and it's also something I'm comfortable with right now.  On Friday, I got assigned AMZN $141p. However, I've been successful with AMZN puts for a few months now and haven't been assigned. When I add up all the premium I've gained and do the math on my true cost basis, it brings the $141 down to around $131.  If I were to sell an AMZN covered call today for 8/18 at the $131 strike, my premium would be $9.40. This brings my cost basis down even further to like $122 -- so you can sit there and play the game all day with premium dropping the cost basis the further you go.  What's the downside to this? Am I missing something? It seems too lucrative. Is it just because I've been successfully not getting assigned for awhile?  &amp;#x200B;  Edit: I'm realizing "Cost Basis" is probably the wrong term here.

[Hodling Nvda since it was $7,50 : selling CC to get eventually assigned strategy so I can diversify?,;,; Hi everyone, I've had Nvidia (108 shares) since January 4th 2016 for a cost basis of about $7,50/share (bought AMZN at the same time too, these were the first stocks I ever bought). These are inside a TFSA (Canadian Tax Free Saving Account, equivalent of a Roth IRA in the US but better since I can cash out tax free anytime). I would like to sell my shares to diversify a bit (AAPL, MSFT, round up to a 100 shares my AMZN position, a few select US companies and the rest in an S&amp;P500 etf). For this I would like to sell 1-2 weeks CC, maybe $10-20 over the price in the hope they get assigned. I'm aware of the risks of the price starting to go dow in the meantime or skyrocketing again past $410-420. Since I've had Nvidia I went through 3 -50% since the highest peak, so not my first rodeo.

The risks of paying taxes on "phantom gains" for wash sales and why would be better to wait 31 days after the last realized loss (so in this case, wait till February 1st 2024 before trading AMZN again).  My question is if in January 2024 considering the same trading history in 2023, a trader bought and sold options, either single leg directional, or did two legged credit spreads, for the same ticker AMZN, but never owning or purchasing AMZN stock itself (either by assignment or otherwise) could this trigger any wash sale shenanigans?

[Soliciting feedback on strategy - Long-term long call vertical spread,;,; Goal, either of:  1. Acquire stock to hold for long term 2. If stock goes up, profit approx 100% and exit position  I'm considering buying long-term long call vertical spreads for achieving this goal. Are there any alternative approaches to achieve the same result or better?  For example, with AMZN (trading at \~$97 share price):  Buy 50/150 Call Vertical spread at \~$45. **Dec 2025** Expiry.  Max profit potential is $5500. Max loss is the full initial investment of $4500.  Reasons I thought of this route:  1. Only buying the call at 50 strike (without the spread) is an unlimited profit position, but it moves the break even point to $105. With the spread strategy, the extrinsic values almost cancel out. Therefore, the break even point is the same as share price. 2. Choosing a long expiration such as Dec 2025 because I can't think of any advantages with a shorter expiry. Is this right? 3. If AMZN stock price goes up to $150 or more before expiry, exit position immediately for approx 100% gain.  Are there any blind-spots here?

[Sold PYPL 62 Put expiring 19 May, might get assigned in IBKR Margin Account,;,; Hi,  I have around 10k worth of AMZN stock in my margin account and my buying power is ~20k. I sold PYPL 62 put expiring 19 May. If it's below 62 on the date, I understand that I will be assigned 100 shares. However, I have no cash in that account. Will IBKR simply assign me these shares on account of my purchasing power or Do I need to have some cash in the account to cover the transaction. What if I don't have the cash.. Does IBKR levy a fine or something?,;,; 2023-05-15 04:12:21]
[Expected moves: Pepsi, Delta, JP Morgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, Amazon and more.,;,; Futures are once again bid higher. Stocks were green pre-market even before the PPI release which followed up well to yesterday's CPI, and was also cooler than expected. Both are encouraging signs about inflation. Earnings season started this morning for all intents and purposes with Pepsi and Delta Airlines being the most interesting names reporting so far. Both stocks are higher, and both have beaten their expected move slightly (so far). This is something to keep an eye on as earnings season kicks off. As mentioned yesterday, IV and expected moves in individual stocks are the lowest they've been in years. That does not mean options are completely wrong per se, vol is low for a reason across the market... But what it does mean is that individual stocks are more likely to move beyond their expected move on earnings than on average. Simply because the moves are that much smaller than typical. It also means the vol crushes after earnings are less, which may be helpful in deciding whether or not to hold positions through the event.   It's also entirely possible that any outsized moves happen more often in one direction than the other, which has more to do with the overall trend in the market. right now that trend is higher as we enter earnings so keep an eye on whether stocks beat expected moves to the upside more than the downside, or vice versa.

[Is it a bad idea to trade options after earnings to take advantage of good premiums?,;,; I have some AMZN shares in a margin account. I was thinking after the earnings call, depending on the move I could profit from the higher than average premiums at this time i.e. if there is a large drop by tomorrow, I can sell a put further away from the dropped price (and at a range I would still be comfortable owning the shares). If there is a good gain, then I can sell CC further away from the risen price. Do people usually do this?,;,; 2023-04-27 16:58:00]

[Dabbling into Calendar spreads,;,; I've mainly always traded just long calls/puts or straddles so I have a question for you guys here.  Lets say I bought an amzn calendar spread buying 50 105 calls for March 24th and sold 50 calls for March 17th. I know this is a very high risk trade but I'm wondering what would happen if come March 17th or prior we're above 105- do I need to close to limit losses because what would end up happening if for example it closes above 105+ after March 17th and then sells off shortly after? This is basically the worst case scenario for a calendar spread right?  Thank you!,;,; 2023-03-01 22:03:34]

[Barron's projections of earnings reports,;,; Hi all, I am a Barron's daily reader (since last year only) as many in this community (I assume). I use it for general financial trends and analysis. Recently I observed their projections are proving to be right ahead of earnings reports as below.  1) AMZN Q3 22: they predicted stock will drop and it dropped from \~110 to \~90.  2) TSLA Q4 22: predicted stock will beat estimates and it went from \~145 to \~175  3) UPST Q1 23 (2 days back): predicted stock will perform above estimates and it sky rocketed \~40% yesterday (though it is dropping today). I was brave enough and sold puts on UPST and they printed money.  What you guys experience with Barron's projections going into earnings. Do you take these cues to place contracts ? I just want to make sure am not just lucky but want to find the correlation. Thanks!,;,; 2023-05-11 18:17:13]
[Earnings Post-Mortem for the Week of 7-31-23,;,; I watched 37 stocks this week that had been winners of 3 or 4 of the past earnings when it comes Straddles/Strangles. My strategy is usually about a week before to enter a position of Call +1/ Put -2, which usually evens out the pricing between the legs. Of those: 2 were breakeven, 18 were winners, and 17 were losers.   So statistically, I would call it a draw.   What you were really hoping for was that you played one of the following:   \- Arista (ANET): +312%   \- Fortinet (FTNT): +163%   \- Generac (GNRC): +115%   \- Apple (AAPL): +43%   \- Sunrun (RUN): +28%     Winners that had only exceeded the implied move for 2 quarters out of the past 4:   \- Catepilar (CAT): +220%   \- Amazon (AMZN): +62%  &amp;#x200B;  The interesting thing is, if you overlay the Equity Surprise index ([https://www.yardeni.com/pub/citigroup.pdf](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/citigroup.pdf)) over this, it's almost exactly what we would expect.

[Earning Reports Post Mortem for 10-27-23,;,; Movement post earnings for Q4 continues to underwhelm. Occassional few big winners like $ENPH.  I tracked these based on where the option pricing closed at the end of the week, just to save time on the analysis. Some will have moved intraday, but this really highlights most stocks aren't holding on to the moves by the end of the week. Strangle was identified based on stock pricing the Thursday prior to earnings week. With interest rates rising, and the VIX now around 22, selling options around ER might be the winning strategy. Of course if you are selling options, make sure you understand risk management and plan for assignment if you are wrong. :).  &amp;#x200B;  |Ticker|End of Week P/L|Strangle| |:-|:-|:-| |GE|\-100%|C107 / P105| |PHM|\-100%|C71 / P69| |MMM|\-100%|C88 / P86| |SNAP|\-100%|C10 / P8.5| |BA|\-100%|C185 / P180| |AR|\-100%|C28.5 / P27| |INTC|\-100%|C36 / P34.5| |AMZN|\-100%|C129 / P127| |NOW|\-88%|C560 / P557.5| |KO|\-71%|C55 / P53| |IBM|\-55%|C139 / P137| |V|\-52%|C235 / P232.5| |META|\-51%|C315 / P310| |LUV|\-50%|C24.5 / P23| |JNPR|\-38%|C26 / P24| |CHTR|\-36%|C437.5 / P432.5| |ABBV|\-21%|C146 / P144| |HSY|\-16%|C192.5 / P190| |ADM|\-4%|C74 / P72.5| |DHR|32%|C207.5 / P205| |GOOG|55%|C139 / P137| |VZ|65%|C32 / P30.5| |XOM|94%|C114 / P112| |UPS|96%|C152.5 / P150| |ENPH|96%|C116 / P114|  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-10-27 22:07:34]
[1 Month Update/Retrospective on broken wing butterfly/condor strategy.,;,; At the start of the new year, I decided to test out a new trade strategy that had been on my radar for a while. I made a post on this sub with a rundown on some of the mechanics of the trade, and have been having a blast learning how the spreads behave.  I know it's still very early and movement in the market has been relatively uniform with an upward bias so the limits haven't been tested very well, but it has still provided me with a bunch of data and opportunity to learn about the position maintenance.  For a quick TLDR: I am trading broken wing / broken heart butterflies with complete disregard for price action and charting. I enter solely on delta, IV, and liquidity. This is glossing over a lot of the nuance, but this is the breadth of the trade.  The odd thing about these spreads are how little maintenance they require up front even with their short DTE, and tend to get more exciting after a bit of a down trend as expiration approaches. Since we have been in an upward market this month, every trade was made with a put credit upon open with a bullish bias. I imagine they would perform worse (or at least require more frequent maintenance) from a bearish call credit side, since the market tends to be more "spiky", exposing my positions to quicker breaches as volatility increases. Down markets don't just dump, they bounce down, and my short dated positions are at the mercy of those bounces from the call side.  [Broken heart butterflies are more reminiscent of condors, hence the name there.](https://preview.redd.it/p69be3kglefc1.png?width=1833&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bdd5cd82bc1791e130aa0f6175f6cdec68e3357)  [The breach column is my trailing long for the entire position, and against DTE, dictates maintenance. It turns red when I get breached :D](https://preview.redd.it/3z0nhi4llefc1.png?width=1831&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e2abd9f7c350691ad394b8f7516e53fa54d857dc)  I slapped together a google sheet to track and do all my math for me, so I barely watch the charts on this. I let things run until a position is at risk, and make adjustments based on time to expiry.  I don't hold my butterflies to expiration since pinning the max win is a stroke of pure luck, therefore I immediately set a BTC order at 2% of the max risk width. They tend to automatically close at about 5-7 DTE on a favorably trending market.  The only maintenance I had to do the entire month (thus far) was rolling out the GLD condor. I probably could have waited until expiration and still hit profit, but I hate holding anything all the way to the end. The position was breached entirely by the spot, and the beauty about rolling these condors out is the leading debit spread covers a TON of the cost of rolling the credit spread, since it's further in the money. I sold the debit spread, rolled the credit spread out by 10 days and down to a 24 delta (collecting a 4 dollar credit in the process) and left the width the same. The only thing to look out for is once the spreads are broken, your collateral increases on that rolled spread so I always have some liquidity available to make it happen.  I try to keep trades running to maintain a 50-70% buying power used leaving me about 30% free BP to roll should the need arise.  Being more aggressive will have higher returns, but leave you exposed to a loser with no way to fix it.  The most difficult thing with this strategy is letting the positions move to profitability and not fiddling with them too early. The theta curve really kicks into high gear with less than a week left and could see you closing a position with a credit even after opening for a credit. It just takes a bit of willpower and trust in the numbers to let an early loser come back to a nice win. I decided to take the first month slow and close everything at about 2% of risk, but after watching the profit curve, I may leave the spreads on an extra day or two to squeeze more out of the position. Granted, if the spot is already at risk, I'll take what I can get and get out.  I also always want my extra profit to come from the upside heading down, not a rebound to profit.  The max profit for these spreads, however, is not something I care to attempt with any regularity.  Since we are in the midst of earnings season and a few of my positions are exposed, I may close them early to avoid any sudden breaches. Google is going for the ride though, since my position is significantly out of the money on the put side.  Ideally, I would stick to indices, but I wanted to roll a few highly liquid tech stocks to see the performance.  Naturally, I'll also avoid ex-div where applicable.  I opened a Robinhood account dedicated entirely to this strategy because it has a sexy UI and is perfectly adequate to handle these trades.  [Not sure why the BP doesn't line up with the spreadsheet but everything else tracks.](https://preview.redd.it/wjnqxew3refc1.png?width=1346&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4af7f27d0b69a28164aa2cdb87e57099192aee54)  [What a couple of the open positions look like on RH. 3 option are the Butterflies, 4 option are the Condors.](https://preview.redd.it/7puef70dvefc1.png?width=411&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9cbc89a7a5c49ec5b9cb23bfa874db78af895540)  I plan to keep this going for the entirety of this year, and hopefully this gives you some insight into a comprehensive (albeit straightforward) mechanical trade plan.

[Earnings expected moves, Amazon, Apple, Coinbase, Draftkings and more.,;,; A couple of giants report after the close, amidst a heavy earnings calendar. On the economic front, we get the NFP jobs number tomorrow morning.  Here's a preview of Amazon and the options setup, which can be a good sense of the overall set-up into an earnings event. The expected move is about 6%. That compares to the most recent earnings moves of -4%, -8%, -7% and +10%. So today's expected move is just shy of the mid of the past 4 earnings moves with the most recent earnings having moved less (-4%).   The IV of the weeklies is about 100. That compares to the 30 day IV of about 43. Of course, the weekly options expire tomorrow, so really they should be thought of as an expected move, and less so as vega. That 30 day IV (44), which is a purer representation of vega, is higher than the 30 day realized vol (how the stock has actually moved over the past 30 days) of just 27. Amazon's realized vol over the past month is quite quiet compared to how its moved over the past year, with its yearly realized vol being 39.   That paints a picture of very high IV compared to the stock's very recent history, but options priced for earnings that are leaning towards a move slightly less than the stock has moved over the past year on earnings. This comes in an overall lower IV and realized vol environment over the past few months.  An Iron Condor, set at the expected move, and $1 wide on the wings, would need AMZN to stay within about 120.50 and 136.50. The bullish expected move lines up very near to the highs of 2023 in the stock, which happened within the past month. Here's how that looks on the chart.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/9xla9tfv4wfb1.png?width=1138&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a633c4f78fbeae60a6c6b1a1e9f7d24752f669fa  Apple's expected move of 3% compares to earnings moves over the past year of +5%, +3%, +8% and +3%. Again, low IV compared to earnings over the past year, but AAPL's realized vol over the past month is just 13! Options buyers have not been doing well in those conditions and the low IV into earnings is a reflection of that suffering. 3% is about $6 in either direction.

[Closing Vertical Option Spread,;,; Two-part question;  1) I've just started using the vertical call/put spread strategy; however, one major issue I'm coming up with is closing the position. When I'm up 50%, I want to sell it before the expiration date, but when I put a limit order in, and even if the spread price reaches the sell limit amount, the order does not go through. Is this normal?  2) If I don't sell the spread by the expiration date and the spread is well in the money, does it get sold automatically at the end of the day, or do I need to put a sell order manually?,;,; 2023-08-08 09:35:08]
[Taking advantage of volatility spikes in meme stocks,;,; I'm largely of the opinion that meme stocks are poor investments and it's best to stay away from selling options on them. However their occasional intraday volatility provides some very nice vega-centric opportunities on the option chain. A couple good examples of this lately have come with AMC and GME.  [I have a video detailing how this works here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7IQSeGdZLE). It should help explain things a little more visually but for more detail I'm writing it all out below:  For a little background, this approach looks to capitalize in a large intraday or overnight spike in a stock. The opportunity allows for us to sell puts out of the money and profit as the stock settles. The great part is that we don't have to get in early and guess which way the stock will run, but rather we wait for the volatility and use that opportunity to react to it.   More specifically, we look for 4 main points on these trades.   **1) A spike in the stock.** This one is pretty self explanatory. Whether it's overnight or intraday, we're just looking for a large green candle  **2) Good news driving the spike.** This can be anything from positive earnings to potential acquisition rumors. The key point here is that we want to avoid is the "$X is moving higher today on no apparent news" trend we see a lot with highly shorted stocks. There MUST be an identifiable, logical reason for the green candle.   **3) There must be an established trading base where the stock took off from.** This concept will be a little clearer with the AMC/GME examples below, but if a stock sees a big green candle and jumps from 15 to 20, we want there to be some sort of established trading history at or around $15/share as opposed to the stock jumping from 10 to 15 and then from 15 to 20. The reason we want to identify this level is because in theory even if the good news from #2 turns out to be a baseless rumor, then the stock should simply return to where it was trading before that news.   **4) There must be decent option premium at the trading base we identify as a part of #3.** For me this is typically anywhere 1% RoR or greater.  At this point it's important to take a step back and understand why this works and why this opportunity exists on spikes. You aren't going to find an opportunity like this just because a stock sees a large jump in price. A spike alone doesn't always create this type of opportunity, however a spike in price COMBINED with a spike in implied volatility does some pretty interesting things to the option chain.   Using the AMC example below (spoiler) we see an interesting trend with the price of the 4.5p we sold as the price of AMC increased. Not included in the video, [here is a chart depicting the price of the 4.5p (candles) compared to the theoretical price of the option (purple](https://imgur.com/a/oAVkx3y). With the price of AMC jumping upwards, you would expect the price of the 4.5p to decrease, as depicted by the purple line. However thanks to the spike in implied volatility, the decrease in the price of the 4.5p lags a little bit. THIS is the idea behind what we're targeting here.  So let's jump into the examples:  **Example 1: AMC 3/28 trade**  On March 28th, AMC spiked from 4.71 to 5.50/share on rumors of AMZN exploring a potential takeover. The stock had been trading at the 4.40-4.60 level for the past week so we were able to identify that level as the "trading base".  So in just that short paragraph, we have 3 of the 4 elements we're looking for in a trade. We had (1) a large spike, (2) caused by positive news relating to a potential AMZN takeover on a stock that (3) had been trading within a 4.40-4.60 range over the past week. Now the only thing left to identify was option premium at that base.   The 4.5p expiring 3/31 fell squarely in the middle of that range so it would logically be our target for this one. At the time of this spike, which was roughly 1:30pm, we could sell the 4.5p for $0.12 of premium. That represents a $0.12 return on $4.38 of risk (4.5 strike minus premium received) which is a 2.7% return on risk. Comfortably in excess of our 1% target.   AMC uneventfully finished the week at $5.01, dipping down to $4.83 at its lowest. As such, our 4.5p we sold at the trading base were never in any real trouble and we made a very stress-free $120 since we sold 10 contracts.  **Example 2: GME 3/22 trade**  On the morning of March 22nd, GME was set to open as high as +50% after it reported positive earnings results. Right off the bat that meets criteria 1 and criteria 2 being a large spike based on positive news.   While it had closed at 17.65 before earnings, it had gotten up above $18 during that trading session so I was comfortable with considering the low $18's as our "trading base" for this opportunity.  That takes us to step 4. Would there be any premium on put options around 18? We know that our AMC opportunity existed due to a spike in implied volatility, but with this GME jump being driven by earnings I was a little skeptical of this opportunity since I felt IV crush would kill the deep OTM options. However, to my surprise the implied volatility actually briefly moved higher that morning thanks to the sheer magnitude of the spike. We were able to sell 10 3/24 18.5p for $0.15 shortly after the market opened.   While GME did move lower from its 26.80 open, it leveled out as it finished that day at 23.86. This was enough to kill IV (which consequently resulted in the deep OTM puts getting crushed) enough for us to exit this trade the same day we entered for a debit of $0.04. The $0.11 gain resulted in a profit of $110 for us in a few short hours.   One important thing to note on this one was the quick in and out. When IV dips back down and you can take a substantial amount of profit, do it. Anything can happen with these stocks and the shorter you're in the trade, the less time there is for something to go wrong.  I've run this strategy across several different stocks with a very high success rate. It works a lot, but of course things can *always* move against you so at the end of the day the best advice is to make sure you size your positions appropriately and feel comfortable potentially taking assignment at the strikes you sell. For me that means sizing it the same way I would size any other trade because at the end of the day the worst thing that happens is you end up with shares at a lower basis than where you first entered.,;,; 2023-04-10 16:34:48]
[Expected Moves: Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Snap, Boeing and more.,;,; SPY was down 2.5% last week, more than the 1.8% move options were pricing. Despite the day-to-day volatility, it is only down about 1.6% on the month. Speaking of the day-to-day volatility, intraday volatility has been even more extreme, adding to the feeling of a wild market even though it hasn't necessarily cracked or seen panic selling overall. However, certain sectors have seen steep declines recently, and the VIX is now near 22, its highest level since March. As was the case with September expiry, this week begins a new vol/gamma regime where some of the strikes that may have been acting as support or even magnets over the past week or so have expired. Keep an eye not only on the VIX this week but also the 0DTE expected moves. Currently SPY 0DTe expected moves are approaching 1% and QQQ is now over 1% each day. Several days last week the markets moved that amount in both directions, multiple times in a day.  &amp;#x200B;  **Expected Moves for the Week**  * **SPY**: 1.8% (roughly $413-$429) * **QQQ**: 2.3% (roughly $346-$363) * **IWM**: 2.4% (roughly $162-$171) * **TLT** 2.1% (roughly $81-$85) * **USO** 3.5% (roughly $77-$84)  &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar**  *Tuesday*  * 9:45am - SP Global PMI  *Wednesday*  * 10am - New Home Sales  *Thursday*  * 8:15am - ECB Monetary Policy Announcement * 8:30am - GDP  *Friday*  * 8:30am - Core PCE  &amp;#x200B;  **Earnings Calendar with Expected Moves**  *Tuesday*  * **MSFT** Microsoft Corporation **4.2%** * **GOOGL** Alphabet Inc. **4.9%** * **V** Visa Inc. **3.5%** * **KO** The Coca-Cola Company **2.3%** * **NVS** Novartis AG **3.4%** * **TXN** Texas Instruments Incorporated **4.3%** * **GE** General Electric Company **5.3%** * **RTX** Raytheon Technologies Corporation **4.1%** * **SNAP** Snap **17.5%**  *Wednesday*  * **META** Meta Platforms, Inc. **7.8%** * **TMO** Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. **4** **.5%** * **TMUS** T-Mobile US, Inc. **3.9%** * **IBM** International Business Machines Corporation **4.0%** * **NOW** ServiceNow, Inc. **6.0%** * **BA** The Boeing Company **4.9%** * **KLAC** KLA Corporation **4.9%** * **PXD** Pioneer Natural Resources Company **2.8%** * **ORLY** O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. **5.5%**  *Thursday*  * **AMZN** Amazon.com, Inc. **6.2%** * **MA** Mastercard Incorporated **3.8%** * **MRK** Merck &amp; Co., Inc. **3.3%** * **UPS** United Parcel Service, Inc. **4.8%** * **HON** Honeywell International Inc. **3.3%** * **BMY** Bristol-Myers Squibb Company **3.1%** * **MO** Altria Group, Inc. **2.0%** * **NOC** Northrop Grumman Corporation **3.0%** * **BSX** Boston Scientific Corporation **3.5%** * **VALE** Vale S.A. **4.0%** * **CMG** Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. **6.4%** * **VLO** Valero Energy Corporation **3.8%** * **F** Ford Motor Company **5.0%**  *Friday*  * **CVX** Chevron Corporation **2.7%** * **XOM** Exxon Mobile **3.0%** * **ABBV** AbbVie Inc. **3.8%**  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/rhot61klkvvb1.png?width=853&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c14f08bddd5f2cbc1f58cd124a94c63c90999d7f  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-10-23 03:54:13]

[Expected moves today, Powell, SPY, VIX,;,; Futures are lower for a 3rd straight day as the market waits for Fed Chair Powell's testimony in front of Congress. Some of his prepared remarks were released before the bell. The 3 day losing streak hasn't added up to much of a sell-off as of yet. The SPY is lower by about 1.5% since an intra-week high last Thursday. Nor has it affected vol much, the VIX is even lower than it was during that Thursday high in stocks.   As mentioned alot recently, yes vol is low, but the moves in the market are also very muted. The realized vol in SPY over the past month now sits at 12. Options in SPY are about 11 vol for the upcoming few weeks. In other words, IV is currently reflective of how the market is moving. Therefore option buyers are still having to get direction correct and be very nimble, despite how "cheap" vol is. Short-term option trading is basically a battle between implied vol, and realized vol. The mean reversion of IV (buying low IV, selling high IV) typically needs more time to play out. Speaking of that, when vol is this low for this long it's sometimes helpful to begin to look out a few months and see how low IV has been dragged down by what's happening recently. A look at SPY vol out in November and December shows at-the-money vol around 15-16. To put that in perspective, that's both below historical averages for IV, but it's also much lower than the realized vol if SPY over the past year, which is around 20, even with the slow grind of the past few months.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Action:**  * Tesla Inc (TSLA) +0.54% * Marathon Digital Hldgs Inc (MARA) +5.38% * Riot Platforms Inc (RIOT) +3.82% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +0.96% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.66% * Coinbase Global Inc Cl A (COIN) +2.89% * Opendoor Technologies Inc (OPEN) +4.23% * Alibaba Group Holding ADR (BABA) -0.65% * Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) +0.24% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.33% * Carvana Company Cl A (CVNA) +0.55% * Li Auto Inc ADR (LI) +3.14% * C3.Ai Inc Cl A (AI) -0.76%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * KB Home (KBH) Expected Move: 7.97% * Winnebago Industries, Inc.

[The Volatility Drain,;,; \[This is a post about how volatility affects compounded returns\]     Imagine the wish you made on your 10-year-old birthday candles comes true. You are magically given $1,000,000. But there‚Äôs a catch. You must expose it to either of the following risks:  1) You must put it all on a single spin at the roulette wheel at the Cosmo. You can choose any type of bet you want. Sprinkle the wheel, pick a color, a lucky number, whatever you want.  OR  2) You can put all the money in play on a roulette wheel that has 70% black spaces. Place any bet you want, but you must bet it all. And one more catch‚Ä¶you are required to play this roulette wheel 10x in a row. Your whole bankroll including gains each time.  Think about what you want to do and why. Even if you cannot formalize your reasoning, take note of your intuition. I‚Äôll wait.  Let‚Äôs proceed.  First of all, the correct answer for anyone without a private jet is #1. Just spread your million evenly, pay the Cosmo its $52,600 toll and try not to blow the rest of it before you get to McCarran. For many of you who computed the positive expected value of option #2 then you might feel torn.  Welcome to a constrained version of the St. Petersburg paradox.  The expected value of a single spin with a million dollars spread over the favorable blacks is $400,000 (.70 x $1,000,000 ‚Äî .30 x $1,000,000). A giant 40% return.  But if you are forced to play the game 10x in a row, there is a 97% you will lose all your money (1-.70¬π‚Å∞).  *What‚Äôs going on?*  This problem highlights the difference between arithmetic or simple average return vs a compounded return. If you made 100% on an investment over 10 years, the arithmetic average would be 10% per year while the compounded annual return would be 7.2%. I won‚Äôt demonstrate the math, but you can always ask me or just Google it. The mechanics are not the point. An understanding of the implications will be, so hang on.  In option #1, you will be in simple return land. In option #2, you are in compounded return land. Compounded returns are not intuitive, but they are much more important to your life. Let‚Äôs see why.  **Sequencing and the geometric mean**  * Compound returns govern quantities that are sequenced such as your net worth or portfolio. If you earn 10% this year, then lose 10% next year, you are net down 1%., right? While the arithmetic average return was 0% per year, your compound return is -.50% per year (.99¬≤ ‚Äî 1). * Let‚Äôs thicken the plot by increasing the volatility from 10% to 20%. If you win one and lose one, your arithmetic mean is 0, but now your compound return is -2% per year. Interesting.  Let‚Äôs turn to [Breaking The Market](https://breakingthemarket.com/math-games) to see what happens when we tilt the odds in our favor and really ramp the vol higher. In his game, a win earns 50%, while a loss costs you 40%.  * The expected value of betting $1 on this game is 5%. But this is the arithmetic average. The geometric average is a loss of 5%! * If you played his game 20x, your mean outcome is positive but relies on the very unlikely cases in which you have an almost impossible winning streak. You usually lose money. * As BTM explains: *Repeated games of chance have very different odds of success than single games. The odds of a series of bets ‚Äî specifically a series of products (multiplication)- are driven by, and trend toward, the GEOMETRIC average. Single bets, or a group of simultaneous bets -specifically a series of sums (addition)-, are driven by the ARITHMETIC average.*  **The most important insights to remember!**  * Arithmetic means are greater than geometric means; the disparity is a function of the volatility. * Mean returns are greater than median and modal returns ([Wikipedia pic](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/cf00b591fb48bf322ac442f15/images/ea90584a-e4e6-44a6-9d79-b3888e74a0d6.png)). In other words, even in positive expected value games, if the volatility is high and you bet the bulk of your bankroll, your most likely outcomes are much worse than the mean.     # Using this in real life  **Step 1**  *Recognize compounded returns when you see them. We have already seen them in the domain of betting and investing.*  Consider these questions.  * I want to raise the price of my product by 60%, how many customers can I lose while maintaining current revenue? * If CA experiences a net population outflow of 20% in the next 20 years, how much would it need to raise taxes on those that stayed behind to make up the shortfall? * If muscle burns 2x as much calories at fat and I lose 40% of my muscle mass, how much less calories will I burn while at rest?  After groping around with those you may have found the general formula: X / (1-X)  &amp;#x200B;  [ Credit: emathhelp.net ](https://preview.redd.it/u2j6jhdkqt8b1.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1bc0ab4b1e1718cc07a88b3d5851b2754294ad8a)     If you lose 20%, you need to recover 25% to get back to even. Lose 50%, and you need 100% to get back to even. 100% volatility and you are certain to go broke. Look at the slope of that sucker as you pass 2/3.  In other words, negative volatility is a death spiral. Let the brutality of the math sink in.  Why has nearly every real estate developer you know went bust at some point? Because they are in the most cyclical business in the world and love leverage. Leverage amplifies the volatility of their returns by multiples. Compounded returns are negatively skewed. Mercifully for them, zero (aka bankruptcy) is an absorbing barrier.  **Step 2**  *Protect Yourself*  * Diversify your bets. In the earlier casino example, if you could divide your million dollars into 10 100k bets you would now have a basket of uncorrelated bets. If you could bet 1/10th of your bankroll on 10 such wheels you‚Äôd expect to make 400k in profit (7 wins out of 10 spins). With a standard deviation of 1.45 you now have a 95% chance of getting at least 5 heads and breaking even on the bet instead of a 97% to go bust in the version where you bet everything serially. * When a bet is very volatile, reduce your bet size. If you put 100% of your net worth into a 20% down payment on a home you lose half your net worth if housing prices ease 10%. In investing applications, variations of Kelly criterion are good starting points for bet sizing. * Remember that for parallel bets to not be exposed to disastrous volatility, your investments must not be highly correlated. Having a lot of investment in the stock market and high beta SF real estate simultaneously is an illusion of diversification. Likewise, if you own 10 businesses, you will likely want them in separate LLCs. For those in finance, you will immediately recognize the divergence in interests between a portfolio manager of a multi-strat fund and the GP of the fund. Izzy Englander wants his strategies to diversify each other while he gets paid on the assets, while the individual PM wants to take maximum risk. Izzy risks his net worth, the PM just her job. If you take one thing away from this paragraph: a basket of options is worth more than an option on a basket. * Insurance is by necessity a negative expected value purchase. You buy it because it ensures financial survival. In arithmetic return land it‚Äôs a bad deal, but if the insurance avoids ruin, it may have a profoundly positive effect on compounded returns which is what we actually care about. * Finally, the power of portfolio rebalancing. If you hold several uncorrelated assets, by rebalancing periodically you narrow the gap between the median and mean expected returns. This is more apparent if there is wide differences in the volatilities of your assets. * I ran a bunch of Monte Carlo sims on ‚Äúcoin flip assets‚Äù with positive drift. Some takeaways were a bit surprising. * If the volatility of your portfolio is about 9% per year, median returns are about 90% of the mean returns. At this level of volatility, rebalancing has little effect. * If the volatility of your portfolio is about 15% per year, median returns are about 50% of the mean returns if you rebalance. * Rebalancing actually lowers your mean returns when the volatility of the portfolio is high even though it raises the median. My intuition is by taking profits in the higher volatility assets it truncates the chance of compounding at insane rates, but it also cuts the volatility by so much that it provides a much more stable compounded return. The higher the volatility the more of the mean return is driven by highly unlikely right upside moves. * The impact of high volatility is stark. It is extremely destructive to compounded returns.  # For finance folk and the curious  Compounded returns are negatively skewed. Black-Scholes option models use a lognormal distribution to incorporate that insight. The higher the volatility, the greater the distance between the mean and mode of the investment. [Example pic from Quora](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/cf00b591fb48bf322ac442f15/images/eee8f445-0463-4b63-b94b-8ac042373753.png).  * A recollection from the dot com bubble. Market watchers like to say the market was inefficient. The options market would disagree. Stock prices and volatilities were extremely high reflecting the fact that nobody understood the ramifications of the internet. Had you looked at the option-implied distributions is was not uncommon to see that a $250 stock had a modal implied price of $50. To be hand-wavey about it, the market was saying something like ‚ÄúAMZN has a 10% of being $2050 and a 90% chance of being worth $50.‚Äù In other words, if you bought AMZN there was a 90% chance you were going to lose 80% of your money. If you are itching to get technical on the topic Corey Hoffstein‚Äôs [paper](https://blog.thinknewfound.com/2017/11/market-implied-probabilities-useful/) explores how risk-neutral probabilities relate to real-world probabilities. * For option wonks, (assuming no carry costs) you‚Äôll recall the concept of *variance drain*. The median expected stock price is S ‚Äî .5 \* variance. The mode is S ‚Äî 1.5\*variance. The higher the variance, the lower the median and mode! The distribution gets ‚Äúsquished to the left‚Äù as the probability the stock declines increases in exchange for a longer right tail like we saw during the dotcom days. * The expensive skew embedded in SPX option prices reflects 2 realities. First, the average stock in the index will see its volatility increase but more critically the cross-correlation of the basket will increase. Since index option variance is average stock variance x correlation, there is a multiplicative effect of increasing either parameter. The extra rocket fuel comes from the parameters themselves being positively correlated to each other.  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-06-28 21:09:03]
[Expected Moves this week, SPY, VIX, QQQ, MU and more.,;,; SPY was lower last week by about 0.6%, again, inside what options were pricing. Implied vol closed extremely low into the weekend, with SPY some at-the-money SPY weekly options sporting single-digit handles. That IV should reset a bit higher out of the weekend but overall vol remains historically below average and at multi-year lows. The VIX closed last week below 13.50. Of course, vol could always go lower, but it's getting to the point where those lower moves would be quite small. In general the 12-13 range in the VIX floor over the past 5 years and only on rare occasions over longer time horizons do you see it closer to 10. That's not to say it can't remain this low for a long time, but it can't get much lower. One thing to note from the past 2 weeks, the daily realized moves of the market versus what 0DTE options had been pricing has started to tip a bit in the favor of the market moves over the expected moves, particularly in the QQQ. That kind of action tends to put a floor on IV as well as option trading in same-day expiry is heavy volume and being more or less re-priced each day based on the prior day's result. Futures are flat to lower to start off the week.  This past weekend included some political chaos in Russia but markets this week will most likely concentrate on a combo of economic data like GDP &amp; Durable Goods and speeches by Lagarde (tues) and Powell (wed, thurs). SPY options are pricing about a 1.1% move for the week at 10 vol (at the money) although that could get a lift on the open.

[Implied volatility stradles for earnings,;,; Hi!  Just a quick question, does anyone play straddles for earnings to benefit from the rise in implied volatility?  I'm trying to find a good strategy for trading earnings. Been researching straddles a bit recently and using an options calculator, but I can't seem to justify the risk of them without an increase in IV, which only (reliably) occurs prior to earnings. Hopefully some of you can tell me if it's a good strategy? :)  Example:  10-day IV average chart, can see that it's starting to rise ahead of earnings.  https://preview.redd.it/2gh2t6jepmub1.png?width=1862&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01dc8aec2b6e5032828cfab975f736015df1f107  Options calculator results below. Assumed 50% rise in IV leading up to earnings - based on 0.6/0.4 (from above)  https://preview.redd.it/eqy93im9qmub1.png?width=386&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5b8c36eee559175b651a0cff6b172e37c2c0eb5  Can see from the above that I could make $100+ if IV rose as expected prior to earnings with the straddle protecting me from movement in the share price. Not aiming to hold after earnings due to IV crush.  Thank you!,;,; 2023-10-16 21:14:13]
[Expected moves this week. CPI, and earnings kick off with JP Morgan, Wells, Citi and more.,;,; Stocks finished lower last week, with the SPY down about 1%, just slightly more than with options were pricing for the holiday-shortened week. The bigger story for options was that implied vol did begin to pick up a bit. The VIX finished the week at about 15.50. That's up from the multi-year lows in the VIX the last week fo June that saw the index below 13. SPY weekly vol also saw a pick-up with the weeklies now 11-12 vol, up from 9-10 we saw with vol at its lows. Coming out of the holiday things stay interesting with economic data while earnings make a return to the scene. On the economic data front, things are a bit quiet the first two days of the week with a few FOMC member speeches on the docket. On Wednesday things pick up with the CPI release, followed on Thursday by the PPI, giving us a good update on inflation. Then on Friday we get a check on the consumer with the UoM consumer sentiment number. Also on Thursday into Friday the story quickly shifts to earnings as a couple of big reports kick off the new season. On Thursday we hear from Pepsi and Delta Airlines, but that's just the warm-up to Friday morning with reports from JPMorgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, Blackrock and more. Earnings announcements will come in fast and furious over the next several weeks.  &amp;#x200B;  * Today's SPY expected move (0DTE): **0.4%** * Today's QQQ expected move (0DTE): **0.6%**  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Movers:**  * Mobilicom Limited ADR (MOB) +74.00% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +3.44% * Nanobiotix S.A.

[Expected Moves: Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Snap, Boeing and more.,;,; SPY was down 2.5% last week, more than the 1.8% move options were pricing. Despite the day-to-day volatility, it is only down about 1.6% on the month. Speaking of the day-to-day volatility, intraday volatility has been even more extreme, adding to the feeling of a wild market even though it hasn't necessarily cracked or seen panic selling overall. However, certain sectors have seen steep declines recently, and the VIX is now near 22, its highest level since March. As was the case with September expiry, this week begins a new vol/gamma regime where some of the strikes that may have been acting as support or even magnets over the past week or so have expired. Keep an eye not only on the VIX this week but also the 0DTE expected moves. Currently SPY 0DTe expected moves are approaching 1% and QQQ is now over 1% each day.

[Amazon earnings + prime day Play?,;,; Who played AMZN earnings? What was your position, where and why did you enter?  Heard on a year or two ago of a fella who consistently took positions on Amazon at earnings closest to prime day. Are you participating, do you notice a relationship between both events?   The guest in the podcast (the actual guy trading), used these two events in Combination and made a few ppl high 5-fig to low 6-gif returns.

[Earnings expected moves, Amazon, Apple, Coinbase, Draftkings and more.,;,; A couple of giants report after the close, amidst a heavy earnings calendar. On the economic front, we get the NFP jobs number tomorrow morning.  Here's a preview of Amazon and the options setup, which can be a good sense of the overall set-up into an earnings event. The expected move is about 6%. That compares to the most recent earnings moves of -4%, -8%, -7% and +10%. So today's expected move is just shy of the mid of the past 4 earnings moves with the most recent earnings having moved less (-4%).   The IV of the weeklies is about 100. That compares to the 30 day IV of about 43. Of course, the weekly options expire tomorrow, so really they should be thought of as an expected move, and less so as vega. That 30 day IV (44), which is a purer representation of vega, is higher than the 30 day realized vol (how the stock has actually moved over the past 30 days) of just 27. Amazon's realized vol over the past month is quite quiet compared to how its moved over the past year, with its yearly realized vol being 39.   That paints a picture of very high IV compared to the stock's very recent history, but options priced for earnings that are leaning towards a move slightly less than the stock has moved over the past year on earnings. This comes in an overall lower IV and realized vol environment over the past few months.  An Iron Condor, set at the expected move, and $1 wide on the wings, would need AMZN to stay within about 120.50 and 136.50. The bullish expected move lines up very near to the highs of 2023 in the stock, which happened within the past month. Here's how that looks on the chart.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/9xla9tfv4wfb1.png?width=1138&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a633c4f78fbeae60a6c6b1a1e9f7d24752f669fa  Apple's expected move of 3% compares to earnings moves over the past year of +5%, +3%, +8% and +3%. Again, low IV compared to earnings over the past year, but AAPL's realized vol over the past month is just 13! Options buyers have not been doing well in those conditions and the low IV into earnings is a reflection of that suffering. 3% is about $6 in either direction.  Here's some other highlights today:  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  https://preview.redd.it/pya4gngx1wfb1.png?width=964&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=275e0bdb45d38790c48b5964c531166b68d9f98c  **Early Movers:**  * Amer Superconductor (AMSC) -21.5% * Paypal Holdings (PYPL) -7.9% * Qualcomm Inc (QCOM) -8.9% * Moderna Inc (MRNA) +2.0% * Robinhood Markets Inc Cl A (HOOD) -4.7%  **Economic Calendar:**  * At 10:00 AM (EST) ISM Services PMI (Jul) Estimates: 53, Prior: 53.9  **Scanner Highlights:**  * **Overbought (RSI):** OSTK (77), JWN (75), IBM (74), KSS (71) * **Oversold (RSI):** HON (31), LUV (40), EBAY (41), TXN (41), MCD (41), SNOW (41), BUD (41) * **High IV:** NKLA (+198%), SAVE (+158%), PYPL (+142%), BUD (+142%), PLTR (+140%) * **Unusual Options Volume:** RAD (+1928%), TRIP (+798%), AMD (+773%), SHOP (+771%), CAT (+611%), QCOM (+563%), MTCH (+551%), NVDA (+494%), MSTR (+408%), PYPL (+402%), MRNA (+398%)  Full lists here: [Options AI Free Tools](http://url5578.options.ai/ls/click?upn=WHju0C1BRPoBuTdL0xEcqZNWu421ak771SLA5jzpsv95uGEO0ajLP5akEsRW2y6pDZX4QFJa1v3fzfaO9A8yOz0yTeY6cCr88OnTS9pQEP5ZHg20lFbWP5WN5WCScJeUxRNSUM-2BQca-2FYsl6GKpuIew-3D-3DVq52_yIbKbwLGaUiHkJ2rj-2FVSLO9FkCqgwrqJUZFsR-2FM-2BW6g1NUq5hkNfzxZGFziJBIqnJxtsA-2B6Nrh8CHL3OufU5QY5TkfelaO1-2BVX2-2BiE-2FOZYaESMPanMchodgzcuMV0SgXO0AWKQd0mPpCRbCJDvN9W4tD3C1dvzaS1mrXk5juhYal1rPGfJPeMpGVa-2Fo8sPWcv2CbVWnHUcodE0Np8mf3aJTecqp68JL2z-2FpTjQ8Jpm4YrPd9i6KBGek4dZUDld5zEUtqYgKbUeIlurPrh48mdWIUvwh7x0elQER0xsE0k66-2FEDh8wNl6vChJFHTr4cV904OU2PB0-2F-2BV6XD1UE7TgAQ-3D-3D).  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-08-03 12:46:54]
[Expected moves: Pepsi, Delta, JP Morgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, Amazon and more.,;,; Futures are once again bid higher. Stocks were green pre-market even before the PPI release which followed up well to yesterday's CPI, and was also cooler than expected. Both are encouraging signs about inflation. Earnings season started this morning for all intents and purposes with Pepsi and Delta Airlines being the most interesting names reporting so far. Both stocks are higher, and both have beaten their expected move slightly (so far). This is something to keep an eye on as earnings season kicks off. As mentioned yesterday, IV and expected moves in individual stocks are the lowest they've been in years. That does not mean options are completely wrong per se, vol is low for a reason across the market... But what it does mean is that individual stocks are more likely to move beyond their expected move on earnings than on average. Simply because the moves are that much smaller than typical. It also means the vol crushes after earnings are less, which may be helpful in deciding whether or not to hold positions through the event.   It's also entirely possible that any outsized moves happen more often in one direction than the other, which has more to do with the overall trend in the market. right now that trend is higher as we enter earnings so keep an eye on whether stocks beat expected moves to the upside more than the downside, or vice versa. Tomorrow morning we hear from the first batch of big banks, including JP Morgan and Wells Fargo. Tech reports start to pick up next week with Netflix and Tesla two of the first big names to go.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Movers:**   Some notable stocks making moves this morning.     * Jiuzi Holdings Inc (JZXN) +71.33% * Snail Inc Cl A (SNAL) +38.79% * 60 Degrees Pharmaceuticals Inc (SXTP) +29.27% * Sofi Technologies Inc (SOFI) -2.83% * Carvana Company Cl A (CVNA) -7.15% * Delta Air Lines Inc (DAL) +3.90% * Tesla Inc (TSLA) +0.76% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) +1.05% * Snap Inc (SNAP) +1.05% * Walt Disney Company (DIS) +0.44% * United Airlines Holdings Inc (UAL) +2.73% * Healthcare Triangle Inc (HCTI) -20.65%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**     * PepsiCo, Inc.

[Option Volatility and Pricing or Options as a Strategic Investment (5th) Book,;,; I'm really torn between which one to get. The book list on the sidebar suggests Option Volatility and Pricing  But I also see many people suggesting Options as a Strategic Investment.  I'm not sure if I'm willing to drop \~$130 for both. But if they are genuinely both good and each have insights the other doesn't, I may.  Are both goods equally good? Or is one slightly better than the other?

[Marked for day trading Options.,;,; I have a question?  Last week I was flagged for 5 day trades.  Friday: I pushed back some of the dates on my Amazon calls in the morning and, when we had the push I sold at the end of the day as it put me over 25k. I'm just over 25k(25.5k). So I am good as of now(till tomorrow lol). I have done this in the past and understand most of the rules and regulations and why I was flagged.  My question is this:  If I manage to stay above 25k for a week or two and don't day trade more then 3 times in 5 days during that time. Does the day trader tag fall off after the 5 days or does it still last for 90 days?,;,; 2024-02-11 20:00:34]

Like for example Meta announced earnings and went up 21% and some contracts were up literally 70x while Amazon announced and their contracts were up 5x. So if you had a scenario of ‚Äúshow me X stocks and their associated contracts that have earnings this week where a 10% movement in the underlying would result in a 10x return and my maximum spend is $500?‚Äù,;,; 2024-02-02 19:42:11]

It could open at a. $1.00.  If I put in a limit of $1 the order will be rejected as it's too far away from the.10 price.  TD Ameritrade won't let you buy options AH/premarket with a market order for today if it's too much more than the option close.  i can place the order now, but it won't be executed until the market open.  Is there a way to get it to not be rejected?,;,; 2023-10-27 08:29:39]
[Sell my company stock to buy QQQ, and then sell daily OTM call?,;,; I work at a tech company (one of Amazon/Meta/GOOG/MSFT) and has \~200k company stocks in hand. I have been hold QQQ positions for a long time and have been selling DTE=1 (expiry=tomorrow) OTM covered calls, and had good profits (essentially wheel strategy -- if QQQ is called away, I sell put to buy it back).  I want to apply the wheel on my company stocks, but it has only weekly options (expired on Fridays). Selling covered calls 3-5 days away leads to exercise more often than selling calls 1-day away, therefore has less profit from the covered calls.  So I'm thinking to sell the company stocks in exchange of QQQ, to be able to sell 1-day expiry covered calls. But I'm still hesitated on the pros and cons. Any analysis/advice is quite appreciated!  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-08-05 18:01:39]
[Expected moves: Microsoft and Alphabet,;,; Alphabet and Microsoft highlight a busy earnings day, both reporting after the close.  Microsoft options are pricing about a 4% move. Prior earnings saw actual moves of -4%, +7%, -1%, -8%. At 60 IV, the options expiring this week are about twice the 30-day IV. The stock itslef has not been that volatile into the event, having essentially flatlined since the first week of October. 30 day realized vol (how much the stock has been actually moving) is just 20, compared to its realized vol over the past year of 29. Sometimes it's interesting to look at trade breakevens zoomed really far out, here's an Iron Condor with strikes based on the expected move, expiring this Friday, on the one-year chart.

Recent earnings have seen moves of +6%, 0%, -3% and -9%. Like MSFT the stock has been flatlining the past few weeks (albeit like everything in the market it's been moving intraday and day to day, just not ending up anywhere new). It's realized vol of 22 over the past 30 days compares to the stock's 34 vol over the past year.

[600 AMZN 09/15/2023 100.00 C finally guessed the Call went to an EU market. Looking at 17k loss.,;,; Last year I bought Amzn at $97, did a 600 AMZN 09/15/2023 100.00 C expecting it to be optioned when Amazon went to $100 it didn't sell. Not when Amzn went above $100, not at 115, not  at any time.   I finally figured out the option apparently went to a European market which only allowed the option to be exercised on the last day. I didn't even understand that was possible.  Now, I'm looking at the option coming due, at $100 when the stock is selling at $142.  I'm thinking of just rolling it out again, but how do I ensure it will be sold again on the European market instead of it being exercised here in the American market? I might just bite the bullet, accept the loss, and keep what make to carry on.   Any other ideas would be appreciated.,;,; 2023-09-12 16:42:46]

[Covered Call - Worth it?,;,; Hi all, I am new to options and have been thinking about the idea of earning some income off of my current stocks. I have a few hundred stocks in Apple, Google and Amazon and have been investing into them for a while. I am up anywhere from 30-110% in unrealized gains.   I started looking at selling covered calls on these stocks using a common strategy that I‚Äôve found online: sell calls out of the money about 30-45 days out with a low delta &lt;0.2 ish and collect the premium - hoping they expire worthless.   My problem is that I do not want to part from the stocks just yet. I looked into strategies of rolling calls up and out so I avoid having them assigned. My question is: Is this a sound strategy? I feel like the downside is much more than the upside. Sure this may work for a little bit but when I do get assigned and have to buy calls to cancel I feel like the overall expected value of this strategy is 0.,;,; 2023-07-08 22:41:46]

I got burned (premium wise) when Shopify shot up last month and am trigger-happy now. Is this just the inevitable downside of my LEAPS going up?,;,; 2023-06-01 17:28:08]
[Doing "dynamic hedging" (selling options, then replicating them by trading the underlying),;,; I'm talking about e.g. [Dynamic Hedging](https://www.amazon.com/Dynamic-Hedging-Managing-Vanilla-Options/dp/0471152803) by Nassim Taleb, or the "replication" that they talk about when teaching Black-Scholes pricing.  But in reality who does this "dynamic hedging" / "replication"?  AFAIK = as far as I know. AFAIK, very few (if any) retail traders do this. AFAIK, "replication" is esoteric black magic reserved for the bigger players on trading desks within banking institutions or hedge funds.  AFAIK, the vast majority (if not all) retailers just create a suitable risk profile with only options (iron condor, credit spread, etc.). They stay in options only and don't bother to "replicate" anything by trading the underlying.  If I'm wrong, I'd like to learn about it.,;,; 2023-04-15 13:38:48]
[Has anyone utilized the Chicken Ranch Options Strategy popularized by James Yates?,;,; I have been reading this book, which is amazing.

[Synthetic long strategy,;,; I‚Äôm looking to gain a better understanding of specific options strategies, especially how to evaluate the greeks.   In this case the strategy is to open a LEAP synthetic long position on an equity that I‚Äôm generally positive about (in this case GS). I would then sell 30dte covered calls against the LEAP and close the covered calls positions if I hit 50% profit, or roll them if they are OOTM.   Details of my current opened trade are: GS $400 Jan ‚Äò26 synthetic long opened for a small credit 410 22 Mar ‚Äò24 short call  How does this strategy stack up, and what should I look out for?

[Earnings Post-Mortem for the Week of 7-31-23,;,; I watched 37 stocks this week that had been winners of 3 or 4 of the past earnings when it comes Straddles/Strangles. My strategy is usually about a week before to enter a position of Call +1/ Put -2, which usually evens out the pricing between the legs. Of those: 2 were breakeven, 18 were winners, and 17 were losers.   So statistically, I would call it a draw.   What you were really hoping for was that you played one of the following:   \- Arista (ANET): +312%   \- Fortinet (FTNT): +163%   \- Generac (GNRC): +115%   \- Apple (AAPL): +43%   \- Sunrun (RUN): +28%     Winners that had only exceeded the implied move for 2 quarters out of the past 4:   \- Catepilar (CAT): +220%   \- Amazon (AMZN): +62%  &amp;#x200B;  The interesting thing is, if you overlay the Equity Surprise index ([https://www.yardeni.com/pub/citigroup.pdf](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/citigroup.pdf)) over this, it's almost exactly what we would expect. We are right around +80, and historically the index almost never goes above that, so historically, we should start getting more negative surprises.. as we should be nearing a peak.,;,; 2023-08-04 23:38:14]
[Feeling juicy? - Microsoft,;,; Okay so I‚Äôve never done an option before but I‚Äôm trying to get into them. ChatGPT4 is rumored to release next week. I believe it is going to be a bigger deal then currently understood and is going to hit the public even harder.     Is this a good enough rational to put a $280 on a call for Microsoft to hit $270 by 3/31? As of right now it‚Äôs at 255.  Currently I‚Äôm a senior technology business student who‚Äôs been using chatgpt like crazy already. Just an idea and was looking for feedback.      Extra:  (Just opinion.  Nothing to do with question)   Babble about my thoughts: (all from my head no sources) I think Microsoft is the best equipped to maneuver the recession. Office suite, Azure gaining market share, windows, Xbox - they game pass is about to own most popular games. All generally recession proof.   I think apples current scope may be to small. They will keep bringing marketable consumer products but I think they need to jump onto the AI gold rush in some way.  Amazon will be behind in AI  Google will always be a threat but they seem to be a little wobbled by chatgpts launch. Microsoft is definitely leading.   What we thinking?,;,; 2023-03-14 04:39:58]

[I'm quite fond of PLUG. It's truly one-of-a-kind.,;,; Over its 23-year tenure as a publicly traded company, PLUG hasn't reported a single profitable quarter ‚Äì **that's a whopping 96 straight quarters with a negative EPS!** Now, that's something not many can claim.  In 73% of their earnings reports, the results fall short of expectations. The last time they actually impressed analysts? November 2020.  And this is precisely what draws me to this stock. Post-report, the stock takes a dip, yet there remains a significant implied volatility in the far-out OTM calls. Perhaps the individuals who offloaded these calls to the hopefuls ahead of the report are now reaping their rewards and freeing up their collateral.  I tend to seize this chance to offload these calls at a premium. This round, I parted with the 09/15 Calls at $15 for a cool $7. Regrettably, I managed to unload only 165 contracts. I had hoped for more, but there were no takers.  Sticking to my routine, I purchased calls closer to the strike ‚Äì 55 contracts at the $12.5 mark. This is in line with my go-to 1:3 ratio spread tactic. That's a credit of $275.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I have a soft spot for PLUG. In a couple of weeks, its trajectory might tilt upwards again, potentially surpassing $12.5 as expiration looms. I'm banking on this pattern.  I had considerable success with a similar strategy just last quarter. That time, I settled for the $10 strike.  https://preview.redd.it/t8287nv4hchb1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05b2cb378951cc8ed5c6f30b72d82a18a9a8d709,;,; 2023-08-10 20:43:12]
[Did I Move the Market?,;,; I've been trading in FRO as my first options trades. I've done very well.  I was buying calls ATM for $.10 to $.40 with 30-60 DTE. Today similar calls are trading at $1.20. FRO is low volume in the stock and very low volume in options. As an example, I currently hold 10% of the open interest in one of my contracts with only 30 contracts.  I am suspicious that my good results have actually moved the market. I ponder the mechanism by which the market moved.  1.) The sellers of the calls I bought got stung by losses and re-evaluated their pricing.  2.) Blabbing here about my positions brought in participants that bid up my target contracts.  3.) Some other phenomenon that smart folks here might share.,;,; 2023-03-20 15:25:43]

[VMW 7/21 135 P,;,; Curious on everyone's thoughts here. VMW has accepted an acquisition offer from broadcom which will provide VMW shareholders 142.50 per share in cash or equivalent of broadcom stock (currently trading at 822.15). The link to the latest aquisition update listed below for reasons why the aquisition has not finalized yet.  https://www.rcrwireless.com/20230522/telco-cloud/broadcom-acquisition-of-vmware-delayed-again#:~:text=Broadcom%20first%20announced%20plans%20to,on%20the%20evolving%20cloud%20market.  The average analyst price target for this stock is about 143.25 with a low target being 134 (under average cost oer share on assignment). I actually used to work at vmware. It's a very good company (2nd largest software company in the world) and the entire business world uses its products. Their main competitors are Microsoft, Google, Cisco, and and Amazon. They have a considerable amount of cash in thr bank, make amazing aquisitions, and are run well.  The stock price is currently 137.83. The 7/21 135 P is currently giving a premium of 3.10 bid and 4.20 ask. Delta is 0.39 and theta of 0.09. This really seems to good to be true of a trade considering the circumstances that there are many factors of upside on assignment and a juicy premium that provides the stock on assignment for around 4% cheaper then its trading now.  I plan on selling a considerable amount of CSPs for this  but wanted the communities take on it first. Please note the aquisition is currently targeting August to settle assuming no issues with Euro and US governments.,;,; 2023-06-24 16:11:18]

[Week of 5-22-23 ER Retrospective,;,; For this week I was tracking 30 stocks as they reported earnings this week. I track ER performance vs. Implied Move on a Monday Open to Friday Close, along with the intraday high and low following ER. This analysis does NOT track options pricing, which especially as we get to the end of the week can see gamma move option pricing significantly, as we are approaching a 0-DTE scenario (Friday).  Best Performance vs. Implied Move:     |Ticker|Implied Move|Actual Move (Intraday)|Move Multiple of Implied Move| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |ZIM|9.5%|25.9%|2.7| |ANF|15.7|34.8%|2.2| |ADI|4%|14.95%|3.7| |APPS|18%|43.25%|2.4| |NVDA|10.1%|26%|2.6| |DLTR|5.9%|19.2%|3.3| |MRVL|7.6%|44.6%|5.8| |ULTA|6.1%|14.41%|2.4|  &amp;#x200B;  Of the 30 stocks tracked (ZIM, ZM, LOW, DKS, WSM, TOL, PANW, URBN, VFC, INTU, FUTU, ANF, KSS, ADI, XPEV, SPLK, APPS, NVDA, SNOW, BBY, MDT, WB, BURL, DLTR, GPS, ADSK, MRVL, WDAY, ULTA, &amp; PDD, 18 could have been profitable ER trades. That equates to 60%, while 40% were losers, and would have made money shorting ER through something like an Iron Condor, or whichever strategy you prefer.   Many of these stocks had good movement post ER, so there were numerous trade opportunities beyond the traditional long option play prior to earnings.,;,; 2023-05-27 00:35:05]
[Expected moves today, Powell, SPY, VIX,;,; Futures are lower for a 3rd straight day as the market waits for Fed Chair Powell's testimony in front of Congress. Some of his prepared remarks were released before the bell. The 3 day losing streak hasn't added up to much of a sell-off as of yet. The SPY is lower by about 1.5% since an intra-week high last Thursday. Nor has it affected vol much, the VIX is even lower than it was during that Thursday high in stocks.   As mentioned alot recently, yes vol is low, but the moves in the market are also very muted. The realized vol in SPY over the past month now sits at 12. Options in SPY are about 11 vol for the upcoming few weeks. In other words, IV is currently reflective of how the market is moving. Therefore option buyers are still having to get direction correct and be very nimble, despite how "cheap" vol is. Short-term option trading is basically a battle between implied vol, and realized vol. The mean reversion of IV (buying low IV, selling high IV) typically needs more time to play out. Speaking of that, when vol is this low for this long it's sometimes helpful to begin to look out a few months and see how low IV has been dragged down by what's happening recently. A look at SPY vol out in November and December shows at-the-money vol around 15-16. To put that in perspective, that's both below historical averages for IV, but it's also much lower than the realized vol if SPY over the past year, which is around 20, even with the slow grind of the past few months.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Action:**  * Tesla Inc (TSLA) +0.54% * Marathon Digital Hldgs Inc (MARA) +5.38% * Riot Platforms Inc (RIOT) +3.82% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +0.96% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.66% * Coinbase Global Inc Cl A (COIN) +2.89% * Opendoor Technologies Inc (OPEN) +4.23% * Alibaba Group Holding ADR (BABA) -0.65% * Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) +0.24% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.33% * Carvana Company Cl A (CVNA) +0.55% * Li Auto Inc ADR (LI) +3.14% * C3.Ai Inc Cl A (AI) -0.76%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * KB Home (KBH) Expected Move: 7.97% * Winnebago Industries, Inc.

[Expected Moves this week, SPY, VIX, QQQ, MU and more.,;,; SPY was lower last week by about 0.6%, again, inside what options were pricing. Implied vol closed extremely low into the weekend, with SPY some at-the-money SPY weekly options sporting single-digit handles. That IV should reset a bit higher out of the weekend but overall vol remains historically below average and at multi-year lows. The VIX closed last week below 13.50. Of course, vol could always go lower, but it's getting to the point where those lower moves would be quite small. In general the 12-13 range in the VIX floor over the past 5 years and only on rare occasions over longer time horizons do you see it closer to 10. That's not to say it can't remain this low for a long time, but it can't get much lower. One thing to note from the past 2 weeks, the daily realized moves of the market versus what 0DTE options had been pricing has started to tip a bit in the favor of the market moves over the expected moves, particularly in the QQQ. That kind of action tends to put a floor on IV as well as option trading in same-day expiry is heavy volume and being more or less re-priced each day based on the prior day's result. Futures are flat to lower to start off the week.  This past weekend included some political chaos in Russia but markets this week will most likely concentrate on a combo of economic data like GDP &amp; Durable Goods and speeches by Lagarde (tues) and Powell (wed, thurs). SPY options are pricing about a 1.1% move for the week at 10 vol (at the money) although that could get a lift on the open.

[Expected moves this week. CPI, and earnings kick off with JP Morgan, Wells, Citi and more.,;,; Stocks finished lower last week, with the SPY down about 1%, just slightly more than with options were pricing for the holiday-shortened week. The bigger story for options was that implied vol did begin to pick up a bit. The VIX finished the week at about 15.50. That's up from the multi-year lows in the VIX the last week fo June that saw the index below 13. SPY weekly vol also saw a pick-up with the weeklies now 11-12 vol, up from 9-10 we saw with vol at its lows. Coming out of the holiday things stay interesting with economic data while earnings make a return to the scene. On the economic data front, things are a bit quiet the first two days of the week with a few FOMC member speeches on the docket. On Wednesday things pick up with the CPI release, followed on Thursday by the PPI, giving us a good update on inflation. Then on Friday we get a check on the consumer with the UoM consumer sentiment number. Also on Thursday into Friday the story quickly shifts to earnings as a couple of big reports kick off the new season. On Thursday we hear from Pepsi and Delta Airlines, but that's just the warm-up to Friday morning with reports from JPMorgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, Blackrock and more.

[Expected Moves this Week: Low IV into NFP and an Earnings Lull, SPY, QQQ, IWM and more.,;,; ## Market View  **Last Week ‚Äì Another positive week and an IV collapse.**  SPY was up 3.5% last week, a move much larger than options were pricing. But because the move was to the upside, and came on the heels of some relieving bank headlines, implied vol collapsed. The VIX is now within a point of its lowest levels of 2023 and is down from 26 to 18.70 since the SVB drama, and actually at or below its historical mean. IV for SPY options expiring this week are in the 10-13 IV range, down significantly from the weekly IV near 30 we saw into the CPI and FOMC in March. There is a slight uptick in SPY IV into the next CPI April 12th, but only to 16 IV at the moment.  **This Week ‚Äì A Jobs Report, but on a holiday.**  SPY options are pricing about a 1.2% move for the 4 day week. This is a holiday week in the second half with Passover beginning Wednesday night and then markets closed for Good Friday. There will be some focus on the NFP release on Friday as market participants are now on the lookout for any signs of recession but the reaction will not come until the following Monday. Stock valuations are on the high side historically after the recent recovery in the market and the set-up into earnings season later this month isn‚Äôt necessarily pricing in the effects of a possible recession. So any signs of cracks on the economic front will be a focus. However, the bull case is that if the Fed is indeed winding down rate hikes and if inflation continues to moderate, the economy may have escaped the worst possible scenario. The NFP this week, CPI on the 12th, and the first 2 weeks of earnings reports in late April should give some clues.  Last week we highlighted the rapid IV decline in The Russell 2000. Options in IWM were pricing in a 5-day move of 4% two weeks ago, 2.7% last week, and this week just 1.8% (4 day week). So the options market is now pricing in much more typical moves in small-cap stocks than in the midst of the banking turmoil. Below is the IWM chart showing the large recent moves and the much smaller expected move now as a result of a collapse in IV (with this Friday highlighted):  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/s7q87qrr1jra1.png?width=1249&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aed5a3b6ca504ed477a72f0d38d8a9dc68113bed  **Expected Moves for This Week**¬†([via Options AI‚Äôs free tools](https://tools.optionsai.com/))  * SPY¬†**1.2%** * QQQ **1.6%**¬† * IWM¬†**1.8%**  * DIA¬†**1.1%**   &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar**  * Monday ‚Äì **ISM Manufacturing** * Tuesday ‚Äì **ADP Employment, ISM Services** * Friday ‚Äì **Non-Farm Payrolls (markets closed)**  &amp;#x200B;  **Unusual Option Volume Friday**  * **HAS, AI, BB, SNOW, TSLA, UPST, UBS, ARKK, CLOV, DDOG, QQQ, SPY**  &amp;#x200B;  ## Earnings This Week  Via the Expected move, weekly IV, and prior earnings moves (starting with most recent).

[Are $GOOGL and $AMZN great long-term buy now?,;,; Hello folks,  $GOOGL  stock is now in a new dip at around $91.79. I already bought some with avg $96.5. I am planning to hold off for the long term. Is it a good buy now? -  considering the AI and supreme court win.  My portfolio is mostly tech stocks like AMZN, MSFT, INTC, and GOOGL. But more than 50% is in GOOGL. I was planning to buy some stocks in AAPL too and start investing in ETFs for diversification.  I  just started in early January 2023 with the intention of long-term holding stocks but I would love to hear from you in this volatile market.  Thanks!,;,; 2023-02-21 22:26:48]
[AMZN core position?,;,; September 2, 1983 AAPL was 0.17 per share. It took them until October 8, 2005 to 10x it's share price and the rest is history. Since the relese of the ipod in 2001 AAPL made a name for itself and quickly became a major part of many portfolios. Amazon was just $0.09 on May 16,1997 and managed to 10x in just 12 months. Amazon is a young company/stock in compairson though has already grabbed the attention of many investors. Basically what im trying to ask is if you think AMZN could be the same kind of core position that AAPL has been for many years. Looking at holding Amazon basically forever,;,; 2023-08-30 07:43:02]

[Amazon:AMZN,;,; Big plans coming for Amazon. For such an industry leader, revenues will be boosted due to AI implementation and expansion investments made in India.   Not only their shopping platform but the use of Alexa I believe will be in most households within 10 years. A chatbot able to communicate with its user and answer any question instantly. So a way better and upgraded version of the Alexa there is now.   They just offer endless utility for other things as well such as their super popular streaming service Amazon Video, and their cloud computing services for businesses.   For such a good price at $118 due to the recent hit they took, I‚Äôm buying.   Always love to hear your thoughts and feedback!,;,; 2023-05-18 15:22:02]
[AMZN Q2 2023 Earnings Report,;,;    \*\* I'm for whatever reason, enjoying going through the documents and attempting to make it easier to digest and read. I just started doing this so any feedback would be appreciated. Goal is for a quick overview of the earnings report for an average person to be able to read and digest\*\*  1. Operating Activities:  The operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows showcases how Amazon generates cash from its core business operations. In both periods, the company's operating activities generated positive cash flow. There was a significant increase in net income, showing growth from a loss of $2.03 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. This highlights a remarkable improvement in Amazon's financial performance and operational efficiency.  2. Investing Activities:  Amazon invested heavily in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions during the analyzed periods. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, the company's investments in property and equipment amounted to $15.72 billion, which decreased to $11.45 billion in the same period in 2023. While the absolute values decreased, these investments are essential for the company's long-term growth and expansion.  3. Financing Activities:  The financing activities section details Amazon's capital structure and shareholder returns. The company engaged in various financing activities, including repurchasing common stock, resulting in cash outflows of $3.33 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2023, and $6 billion in the six months ending June 30, 2022. Additionally, the company obtained proceeds from short-term debt and other financing, contributing $4.87 billion and $4.4 billion in the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. Investors should be aware of these activities, as they impact the company's capital allocation strategy.  4. Cash Position:  Amazon maintained a strong cash position, reflecting its financial stability and liquidity. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased steadily over the periods, reaching $50.07 billion at the end of the twelve months ending June 30, 2023. This signifies the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations and pursue growth opportunities.  5. Debt and Interest Payments:  The company managed its debt obligations efficiently, making principal repayments on long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations. Amazon also paid interest on debt, with cash outflows totaling $349 million and $954 million for the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. These payments demonstrate responsible debt management and the company's commitment to meeting its financial obligations.  6. Net Sales:  Net sales are a fundamental indicator of Amazon's revenue growth and market performance. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, net sales reached $121.23 billion, which increased to $134.38 billion in the same period in 2023, representing an 11% year-over-year growth. Similarly, for the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net sales grew from $237.68 billion to $261.74 billion, showing strong and consistent revenue growth.  7. Operating Expenses:  Operating expenses provide insights into the company's cost structure and efficiency. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, operating expenses were $117.92 billion, which increased to $126.70 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating expenses increased from $230.69 billion to $249.29 billion, primarily due to higher fulfillment, technology, and infrastructure costs. Despite the increase, Amazon's revenue growth outpaced the rise in operating expenses, leading to improved operating income.  8. Operating Income:  Operating income measures the profitability of Amazon's core operations. The company experienced significant growth in operating income, increasing from $3.32 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to $7.68 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating income rose from $6.99 billion to $12.46 billion, indicating improved operational efficiency and profitability.  9. Non-Operating Expense:  The non-operating expense provides insights into Amazon's other income and expenses outside its core operations. Total non-operating expense decreased from ($5.97) billion to ($0.12) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. This decline was primarily due to a positive swing in other income (expense), net, indicating favorable financial management.  10. Net Income (Loss):  Net income is a critical metric that assesses Amazon's overall financial performance. The company experienced a significant improvement in net income, increasing from a loss of ($2.03) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net income increased from a loss of ($5.87) billion to a profit of $9.92 billion, demonstrating a strong financial turnaround.  11. Earnings Per Share (EPS):  Earnings per share is a vital metric for shareholders, as it represents the company's profitability on a per-share basis. Basic earnings per share increased from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.66 for the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. Diluted earnings per share showed similar growth, rising from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.65 for the same periods.  12. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):  Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items that impact the company's financial position but are not part of the net income calculation. For the three months ending June 30, 2022, Amazon's other comprehensive income was ($2.42) billion, which increased to $293 million for the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, other comprehensive income was ($3.41) billion and $807 million, respectively.  13. Comprehensive Income (Loss):  Comprehensive income is the total change in equity during a period, including net income and other comprehensive income. For the three months ending June 30, 2022, Amazon reported a comprehensive loss of ($4.45) billion, which improved to a comprehensive income of $7.04 billion for the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, comprehensive loss improved from ($9.28) billion to a comprehensive income of $8.33 billion, highlighting the company's financial recovery.  14. Segment Information:  Amazon operates through several segments, including North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, all segments showed significant growth in net sales.  ‚Ä¢ North America: Net sales in North America increased from $80.85 billion to $87.75 billion, representing a 9% year-over-year growth.  ‚Ä¢ International: Net sales in the International segment grew from $31.9 billion to $37.4 billion, reflecting a 17% year-over-year growth.  ‚Ä¢ AWS: Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud computing segment, experienced remarkable growth, with net sales increasing from $16.37 billion to $20.2 billion, showing a 23% year-over-year growth.  Conclusion:  Amazon demonstrated robust financial performance and growth in the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. The company's operating activities generated positive cash flow, and net sales increased consistently across all segments. Investments in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions reflect Amazon's focus on long-term growth and expansion.  Although the financing activities included cash outflows related to stock repurchases, the company's strong cash position and responsible debt management position Amazon well for future growth. The substantial improvement in net income and operating income signifies improved financial performance and operational efficiency.  PROs &amp; CONs:  Pros:  ‚Ä¢ Strong Revenue Growth: Amazon has consistently demonstrated strong revenue growth across its various segments. The company's ability to expand its customer base, introduce new products and services, and leverage its e-commerce platform has led to impressive financial performance.  ‚Ä¢ Diversification of Business Segments: Amazon has successfully diversified its business beyond e-commerce. The expansion into cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been a major growth driver, providing the company with a stable and profitable source of revenue.  ‚Ä¢ Innovative and Customer-Centric Approach: Amazon's relentless focus on customer satisfaction, innovative technologies like Amazon Prime, and personalized shopping experiences have helped the company build a loyal customer base and maintain a competitive edge in the market.  ‚Ä¢ Financial Stability and Liquidity: The company maintains a strong cash position and prudent debt management, providing it with the financial flexibility to invest in new ventures and navigate economic uncertainties.  ‚Ä¢ Global Reach: Amazon operates in numerous countries, allowing it to tap into diverse markets and consumer preferences worldwide. Its vast international presence positions the company for further growth and market dominance.  ‚Ä¢ Leading Cloud Service Provider: AWS is a dominant force in the cloud computing industry, serving a wide range of clients, from startups to large enterprises. The profitability and growth of AWS contribute significantly to Amazon's overall financial success.  Cons:  ‚Ä¢ Regulatory Scrutiny: Amazon faces increasing regulatory scrutiny related to its market dominance and business practices. Antitrust concerns and accusations of unfair competition may lead to potential legal challenges and fines.  ‚Ä¢ Labor Practices: The company has faced criticism for its labor practices, including allegations of poor working conditions and treatment of employees at its fulfillment centers. Such negative publicity can impact Amazon's reputation and may affect its ability to attract and retain talent.  ‚Ä¢ Highly Competitive Markets: The e-commerce and cloud computing industries are highly competitive, with major players vying for market share. Amazon faces challenges from established competitors and emerging startups, requiring continuous investment in innovation and technology.  ‚Ä¢ Dependence on Global Supply Chain: Amazon's vast supply chain network is critical for delivering products to customers. Any disruptions, such as those caused by geopolitical events or natural disasters, could affect the company's operations and financial performance.  ‚Ä¢ Profit Margins: While Amazon experiences strong revenue growth, its profit margins have historically been relatively low. Intense competition and ongoing investments in new ventures can put pressure on the company's profitability.  ‚Ä¢ Environmental Impact: As a large-scale retailer and cloud services provider, Amazon's operations have an environmental impact. The company has faced criticism for its carbon footprint, and there are growing expectations from stakeholders for more significant efforts towards sustainability.  TLDR;  Amazon recent earnings report for the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, reveals a robust financial performance and impressive revenue growth across its segments. The company generated positive cash flow from operating activities, showing a significant increase in net income, indicating improved financial health and operational efficiency. Amazon's strategic investments in property, equipment, and acquisitions demonstrate a focus on long-term growth and expansion. With a strong cash position and responsible debt management, the company exhibits financial stability and flexibility. However, regulatory scrutiny, labor practices, and intense competition pose potential challenges. Despite these, Amazon remains a leading player in the e-commerce and cloud computing industries, presenting attractive prospects for investors seeking exposure to a market-dominant, innovative, and customer-centric company with a history of success and growth.,;,; 2023-08-04 00:04:45]
[$AMZN vs. $SHOP: Which e-commerce stock is better?,;,; ## Amazon ($AMZN)  After eight years of profitability, Amazon lost money in 2022, weighed down by investments like its 20% stake in the EV maker Rivian, whose value plunged in 2022. Between the punishment doled out by investors over the last year or so and its soaring valuation during the pandemic, there‚Äôs a lot of noise affecting Amazon shares. After considering those impacts, a bullish view still looks appropriate for the long term.  To deal with its $2.7 billion loss in 2022, Amazon began a raft of cost-cutting measures, including halting its experimental projects, cutting 18,000 jobs, and pausing grocery store growth. Those moves should benefit the company over the long run because 2022 served as a sort of wake-up call: even tech behemoths aren‚Äôt invincible.  However, when we look more closely at Amazon‚Äôs valuation relative to its history, it becomes clear that it may take some time for the bull thesis to play out. On the one hand, growth and momentum investors have been in love with the e-commerce giant for years, especially during the pandemic, when online shopping received a major push forward.  On the other hand, value investors would argue that Amazon has spent much of its publicly-traded life overvalued. The good news is that the company looks undervalued on some measures. For instance, it‚Äôs currently trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 2.0 versus its mean P/S of about 3.6 over the last five years.  Also, Amazon‚Äôs stock and valuation have come down a lot since the pandemic, when it traded at a P/S ratio of 5.0 and above. Additionally, it‚Äôs trading slightly above its pre-pandemic stock price but below its pre-pandemic P/S of about 4.0 to 4.5, also suggesting a long-term bullish view.  ## What is the Price Target for AMZN Stock?¬†  Amazon has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 35 Buys, one Hold, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $135.88, the¬†average Amazon stock price target implies upside potential of about 30%.  ## Shopify ($SHOP)  A review of Shopify‚Äôs stock price action reveals similarities with Amazon‚Äôs. However, there is a critical difference between them. Although Shopify did manage to turn a profit in 2020 and 2021, probably due to the pandemic, it became far more unprofitable in 2022 than it was before the pandemic. Overall, SHOP‚Äôs fundamentals and valuation suggest a bearish view might be appropriate.  Like Amazon, Shopify was pummeled by its investments in 2022. For example, it took a massive $1 billion non-cash loss in the second quarter alone as a write-down of its equity investments, accounting for nearly all of that quarter‚Äôs loss. Unfortunately, the investment-related losses may be masking a larger issue.  Shopify‚Äôs research and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses soared to $1.5 billion (about 43% higher year-over-year) and $1.73 billion (30% growth), respectively, in 2022. However, its gross profit only rose 11% from 2021, while its revenues grew only 21.4%.  Finally, although its valuation has plummeted, Shopify still looks grossly overvalued at a P/S ratio of 12.3, relative to the stronger, larger Amazon. Shopify‚Äôs mean P/S over the last five years is 31.1, but that just shows that it‚Äôs been overvalued for years.  ## What is the Price Target for SHOP Stock?  Shopify has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys, 18 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $49.44, the¬†average Shopify stock price target implies upside potential of 1.6%.  ## Conclusion: Long-Term Bullish on $AMZN, Bearish on$ SHOP  Investor sentiment has long played a significant role in Amazon‚Äôs and Shopify‚Äôs valuations. However, it looks like investors have valued Shopify as if it‚Äôs the next Amazon rather than based on its own fundamentals. Thus, Amazon looks like the clear winner.  Unfortunately, Amazon may have a challenging time in the stock market in the near term due to the possibility of a recession, but the company has staying power and should eventually come roaring back. The key caveat is that a better entry price might materialize, but even at current levels, Amazon looks undervalued when factoring in its long-term potential and historical valuation.,;,; 2023-04-21 09:54:05]

[My AI momentum trading journey just started. Dumping $3k into an automated trading strategy guided by ChatGPT. Am I gonna make it,;,; As a major lurker, I‚Äôve seen quite a few of these ‚ÄúTrading journey‚Äù posts and I decided that I might as well jump in the fire with my very own take.  The weather is just about brewing with enough chaos that we might see a decent tailwind across AI stocks within the next few months. I intend to ride the hypecycle with a an automated AI strategy to capture as much upside value as possible.  **A few things that make me believe the AI hype cycle is just getting started:**  **The Fed‚Äôning**  * Government expenditure in relation to GDP will continue to increase This isn‚Äôt just a US phenomena, Nation states worldwide are increasing government expediture and reach.(Chipps act, various AI accessibility and regulatory acts). A good portion of this will trickle down into the market cap of bluechip co‚Äôs with big AI departments ready for big ol entreprise contracts.  **The upcoming major IOT adoption via regulatory enforcement**  * On this, I can single out an event that most people are sleeping on. The US food supply chain is about to undergo massive digital transformation with FSMA (The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act ). Think big data lakes and lots of machine learning having to be adopted at gunpoint in unseen rates all across the food supply chain.  **Upstream/Downstream innovation in private markets**  * AI tech has been commoditized, can be forked, API called, build on top of. Its pretty fluid and easy to access. As I type this, there‚Äôs tens of thousands of AI startups across all imaginable industries getting past product-market-fit hurdles, opening distribution channels, and ultimately expanding the AI global total addressable market . This early stage innovation will trickle down into public markets in record time. Wait a few months.  **My AI investment strategy - AI investing in AI (kinda ‚Äúquirky‚Äù huh?)**  To create my strategy I asked an AI tool ‚ÄúCan you create a momentum trading strategy focused on AI-focused stocks?‚Äù     &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/agv4ngxvjzcb1.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f4106905719facc3e078dbf048f78a490755b13  The AI-created strategy was interesting but I then made some tweaks based on the basket of AI stocks I wanted to include in this momentum trading approach. I removed IBM (as I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be a key beneficiary or leader in the AI race), and added PLTR (for defence/government AI exposure), TSM (for some semiconductor exposure) and META (this is a questionable one but the open source models that their research team have created our world-class and I don‚Äôt want to bet against Zuck).  You can see the final strategy below. One potential concern I have is the max drawdown from the backtests is a little higher than I‚Äôd like but I‚Äôm willing to roll with it this week.

It provides investors with diversified exposure to stocks of companies that are expected to have higher-than-average growth rates. * AAPL - Apple  * TD - Always good to have at least one bank for diversification * AMZN - Amazon  I know VOO and VUG overlap, especially with AAPL and AMZN, but I want him to have 2 primary ETFs and 3 to 4 stocks.

[Best stock bets of 2024? What's on your radar?,;,; I'm bullish on lithium. For starters, I have a strong suspicion that China is playing a role in manipulating the price of lithium by putting out hyped up headlines stating that they found the world‚Äôs largest deposit of lithium. However, that discovery does not seem to slow down their recent consolidation spree across Western Europe, Africa and South America.  On top of that, global supply chains are already shaky as fuck. This is where well positioned lithium mines and refineries will be in the blast radius of a major tailwind in the next 12 to 18 months:  1. The EV / automaker bloodshed will continue for a few more months in North America until election happens. Foreign market demand will continue to grow. 2. Regardless of conservative opposition we will see the US push through a federal mandate with very hard deadlines on EV adoption. 3. Lithium Ion batteries will reign supreme for longer than you think. Sodium-ion batteries are less dense, less storage capacity, and have limitations of flexibility as they cannot be turned into various shapes like prismatic, cylindrical etc. Hydrogen is not even on the table. 4. Consolidation - Lithium miner consolidation is increasing rapidly. From hostile takeovers to junior miner acquisitions. Cash rich producers (fat from the previous pump) are hungry for some M&amp;A action.  Overall, bullish on lithium long term. My play is to incrementally increase exposure to high and low risk lithium bets over the next few months. I'm bullish on $LIFT.V as a growth stock (largest lithium drill in North America) and $ALB (largest lithium provider to the EV market).,;,; 2024-01-26 02:47:34]

[Total noob looking for a little help,;,; Hey all  So as the title states I'm a total newb to trading in general really. I do feel I have an alright understanding of how to evaluate a stock to some degree of success. However I'm having trouble using that evaluation to accurately predict how a stock is going to react. Obviously there is no exact science to this stuff but I just need to be a little more consistent.   So looking at two stocks this morning during pre-market. AMZN and DKNG, both beat fairly well on earnings. My initial thought process was okay both beat on earnings and both have gapped up a fair amount during extended hours trading, I would think they would continue the breakout maybe after a slight pullback at the open. However AMZN consolidated and eventually it gradually climbs to 143.63 then again gradually sells off throughout the day. Okay makes sense. DKNG however just dumps right off the open and continues to fall throughout the day quite sharply with a couple slight pullbacks, it falls all the way to about 30.38.  So I Googled around a bit trying to figure out why a stock that just posted good earnings would drop off like that. Most common answer I seemed to find was it's more about forward guidance than the actual current earnings. Okay that makes sense. So I went back and looked at both companies guidance for earnings next quarter on TradingView. Both are projected to post worse earnings next quarter than they just posted.   So based on that I would think both of them should take a bit of a dive no? This is where I'm confused. Why would they behave so differently? I'm still very much learning the "market psychology" so to speak and maybe that is where I'm going wrong? Genuinely trying to and interested in learning so any insight or advice anyone can offer would be much appreciated.  As a side note if there are any learning resources you found really helped you when starting out would you mind sharing? :)  Thanks in advance!,;,; 2023-08-05 01:19:49]

[S&amp;P500 bad performance during inflation proof,;,; Hello,  &amp;#x200B;  I've ran the math and the S&amp;P500 during Covid just followed the money in circulation (M2 money supply). The increase in both was around 33%, so basically the net asset value is flat, as this 33% increase has the same purchasing power. But when I compared some of the top companies in the Indice APPL, MSFT, GOOG, TSLA and AMZN I've noticed that all of them made way more than 33%. Does this indicate it's way better for a safe haven investing **during inflationary times** to just focus on the top 5-10 instead of the "whole" market (the 500 companies).  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/bn79ul88gelb1.png?width=2340&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38ddd3c12d9f26e644bb0e6b8e6d3fbe30a8f54b  I also did the math for the lowest 5 companies currently, as I don't know which they were during 2020 January.

I started investing $50 each week into stocks that did well while I was paper trading, but it didn't do so well with real money. I lost about $500 with an account that only had $1000. After a year I decided to become serious about investing and deposited more into my account each week. After about a year, I was able to gain the lost money and am now in the green.  Am I doing alright for an 18-year-old?  Please provide any feedback  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-07-11 01:29:23]

[[Week 2] AI momentum trading journey guided by chat GPT/LLM. Feedback welcome,;,; This is a follow-up on my latest AI trading post where I laid out my short/mid term bullish case on the AI supply chain due to major upcoming disruption driven by policy and private/public markets. Those are:  1. **The Fed‚Äôning:** Major increase in government expenditure in relation to Global GDP that will trickle down into the AI economy. 2. **The upcoming major IOT adoption via regulatory enforcement:** FSMA food traceability act compliance deadline is fast approaching, Chipps Act, etc. 3. **Upstream/Downstream innovation in private markets:** Early stage capital has commoditized AI (APIs, et al.)  with billions of dollars of VC funding. This early stage innovation will trickle down  into public markets sooner that expected.  For those missing initial context, I‚Äôm using AI to invest in AI with automated investing strategies.  **How my AI Momentum Investing strategy is going:**  **The AI portfolio is down slightly from last week (Slowly bouncing back today)**  https://preview.redd.it/hl82lfkrekeb1.png?width=1715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d9bb9a5e9ea41a467f0fa9c966b12beb248e700  **I decided to adjust my automated investment strategy midweek (See below)**  ![img](zk5vp690fkeb1 "  ")  1. First, I look at the momentum of SPY generally, if not I move into SVOL (VIX etf). 2. If there's positive SPY momentum, I then look at if tech is overbought or not (RSI &gt;= 80). 3. If tech is overbought, I stay in SPY. 4. If tech is not overbought, I go into my AI strategy. It's threshold rebalancing at 10%.     https://preview.redd.it/1eeirt01fkeb1.png?width=1057&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42aa2c207f60d2226856f52a58461bac68174e9d  As I initially mentioned, I intend to be super transparent about my bet on AI and share losses as much as wins.

[Portfollio allocation after move from edward jones,;,; Hey guys, I wanted to get your opinion on something. Just for some background, I am 34/M Married (34F) no kids atm, household income is around 200K, only debt is house (about 70K on a 4% mortgage), but we do like to travel a lot. I contribute 15% to my jobs 457 plan biweekly through Lincoln, max out HSA, and have a separate retirement account from an inheritance years ago (sitting with Edward Jones atm). Target retirement date is 2042 - 2045, I get a pension and retiree insurance.  I recently made the decision to ditch my Edward Jones advisor and move everything over to Schwab. I had TDA as a for fun brokerage account, but then got moved to Schwab, that's why I use it. About 6 years ago I received an inheritance, I knew nothing about money and investing at the time, which is why I went to Edward Jones, but I cannot stand the fee's anymore. I have been educating myself the past few years and feel like I am ready to take the plunge to manage it myself. It is currently worth 260,000$ and breaks down as follows --  Roth IRA ( 100% Mutual Funds)  Trad IRA (99% Mutual Funds, 1% cash)  Account 1 ( 47% ETF, 51% Mutual Fund, 2% cash)  Account 2 (44% stock, 21% ETF, 32% Mutual Fund, 2% Cash)  Rate of returns on the account are --  1YR - 18%  3YR - 3.1%  5YR - 9.6%  Once the transfer to Schwab is complete, should I just leave everything like it is and just continue to contribute to what my advisor already had me in? Or does VTI/VTSAX or VOO make more sense? Or even just a target date fund? I have no need for any of this money until retirement and have a higher risk tolerance.

[Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY?,;,; A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings:  https://preview.redd.it/evtbd2dnkgec1.png?width=654&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47c5c6d9f58e6997aad5330dba32ff543e2c8541  Data Sources:  * SPY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/spy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Schwab](https://www.schwab.wallst.com/schwab/Prospect/research/etfs/schwabETF/index.asp?type=holdings&amp;symbol=SPY)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/?guccounter=1)‚Äã‚Äã. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST)‚Äã * SFY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/sfy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Zacks.com](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SFY/holding)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SFY/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST)  **Key Observations:**  * Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. * Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. * Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.  It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.  I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:  1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. 2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&amp;P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. 3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. 4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. 5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. 6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.  It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.  **What are your thoughts?**,;,; 2024-01-24 21:46:21]

[SP500 Technical Analysis &amp; Trading Plan for 8/4/23,;,; *I share my plan for educational purposes and discussion and it is not intended as trade recommendations or ideas. This plan uses Futures levels for analysis.*  ***Recap***: The market again gapped down in the extended hours, briefly moving back towards the expanding range structure in the lower **4550**s and then losing **4530**, a core support level I was watching. In my premarket note, I wrote that one scenario I was looking for was for the market to *‚ÄúTest lower to* ***4504*** *and then a reclaim over the overnight lows at* ***4510*** *would be a good long for me. This would be combined with a gap fill, which targets yesterday‚Äôs low at* ***4528***.‚Äù  I tried this trade first shortly after the open and was a tad early. I tried the trade again about an hour later: Though the test lower was not precisely to 4504, nothing in markets is and all levels exist in something of a ‚Äúzone‚Äù as opposed to precise touches. I got long at 4515 and exited at **4528**, and let my final runner get stopped out on a nice gain due to a trailing stop.   ***Balance/Trend***: After a couple of weeks of balance, the market broke to the downside and has now moved over 100 points lower from Monday/Tuesday highs and is one time framing down for three days now. Even so, the medium and longer term trends are still pointing up and today‚Äôs test to **4506**ish was a hold of the pink trendline that formed the previous ascending triangle.  ***Analysis***: Today‚Äôs support trade initially proved to be a strong move on the part of bulls as the market moved over 30 points higher, though this faltered late ahead of major earnings (AAPL/AMZN) and NFPs due out tomorrow morning.  There are a few core technical structures I am watching:  * The pink trendline in pink which was/is the lower part of the ascending triangle is at **4509-12** for tomorrow. A failure here would likely take the market down to test the resistance that structure broke out from on July 12. I am viewing this as a zone from **4494-98** and would trade it like a pivot (longs above / shorts below) * The expanding range is marked in red in the charts, and if the market continues higher than I would watch for a move back inside of that range at **4550** for longs, or for it to act as resistance (a backtest following a breakout) for shorts * Prior to an overnight low on August 2, I was tracking the balance range as **4559-4609/20** * The aqua blue trend up since March, with support now around **4429**  ***Plan***  * With some of the plan already outlined above in Analysis, the next spots down I am watching for support **4520** and **4497**. Recall that there is a gap from **4497** down to this level, and so I would watch this level as a potential support, but also a trigger for a move through that gap down to **4479**. It is confluent with that triangle breakout level too. * Below that is a spike in the market at **4466** from July 11 that preceded the breakout * **4449** and potentially extended down to **4438**. This was a major decision level in June and into July before the market broke out * Some of the major resistance areas I am watching tomorrow are outlined above. Outside of that, the nearest spot I am watching for resistance is at **4433** * If the market re-enters the expanding range and finds its way back into the balance area, I would first watch for resistance at about **4566** * Just above that is **4570** where the gap that opened up yesterday morning is found. Trading above this level could see a gap fill while a failure there could be indicative of sellers that are still present in that zone * Other spots for resistance are **4582**, **4589**, the balance area high range, **4625**, **4645**  https://preview.redd.it/3c57s012cyfb1.png?width=1714&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65955354f963ba96fdfa1086f21ccdc2679ff084,;,; 2023-08-03 20:05:57]
[Tesla ($TSLA) stock and six other tech titans are responsible for 86% of the S&amp;P 500 2023 performance.,;,;    Tesla($TSLA) stock **plunged nearly 10% last week on earnings**. That caught everyone's attention, but it was just the tip of the iceberg.  0 seconds of 14 secondsVolume 0%   With roughly one-third of the S&amp;P 500 companies **announcing quarterly earnings results this week**, there are none bigger than tech titans **Alphabet** ($**GOOGL**), **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**) and **Meta Platforms** ($META). These four Big Tech stocks alone account for 41% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 year-to-date gain, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.  Adding **Apple** ($**AAPL**), which reports next week, **Nvidia** ($**NVDA**) and **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) stock, Colas says these seven tech giants account for 86% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 gain, which was 7.7% through Monday's close. These seven Big Tech stocks have rallied far more than the S&amp;P 500 this year.  According to Colas, there have been three drivers of outperformance for these tech leaders. First, all seven were deeply oversold at the end of 2022 and received a "January Effect" bounce.  The January Effect is a seasonal increase in stock prices throughout the month of January. The increase in demand for stocks in January is often preceded by a decrease in prices during the month of December, in part due to tax-loss harvesting.     Second, many of these tech companies have been aggressively cutting costs, so earnings power should now be higher than last year. And, finally, interest rates have declined, supporting the valuation of high-multiple stocks, he added.  ## Alphabet, Microsoft Earnings Due  Google-owner Alphabet reports earnings after the closing bell Tuesday. Shares are just below a 106.69 buy point in a **cup with handle**, according to **IBD MarketSmith** chart analysis.  Alphabet earnings are expected to measure $1.08 a share on revenue of $68.8 billion.  Dow Jones software giant Microsoft slid almost 2% midday Tuesday, threatening to extend a losing streak to four sessions ahead of the company's earnings results late Tuesday. MSFT stock is rolling back toward a 276.86 buy point in a **flat base** following a March 17 breakout.  Wall Street expects Microsoft to earn $2.24 a share on revenue of $51.0 billion, per FactSet estimates.     ## Amazon, Meta Earnings Also On Deck  E-commerce giant Amazon continues to trace the right side of a **cup base**, but is seeing resistance around its long-term 200-day moving average.  With earnings due out late Thursday, Amazon is expected to earn 21 cents a share on sales of $124.5 billion.  Facebook parent Meta Platforms will report Wednesday after the stock market closes. Meta stock is out of buy range past a **197.26 buy point** in a flat base, but receding.  The social media giant is expected to earn $2.02 a share on revenue of $27.6 billion.  ## Apple Earnings Next Week  Apple shares reversed squarely lower midday Tuesday. Still, they remain solidly above a 157.48 buy point and at the top of the **5% buy range** that runs up to 165.35.  The Dow Jones tech giant reports its fiscal second-quarter results on May 4. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to earn $1.43 a share on sales of $92.9 billion.     ## Nvidia Holds Up; Tesla Stock Breaks Down  Graphics-chip maker Nvidia remains near its recent highs despite sharp losses midday Tuesday. Shares declined more than 2% in afternoon trade.  The **IBD Leaderboard stock** broke out past a 230.59 handle buy point after the **company's strong earnings on Feb. 23**.  Electric-vehicle giant Tesla stock continues to trade near its lowest level since Jan. 26. In recent weeks, shares triggered the **7%-8% loss rule** from a buy point at 200.76 in a cup with handle. And they are trading sharply below their 50-day line, a key level.,;,; 2023-04-26 06:14:46]

[Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&amp;P 500 gains,;,; = just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing =  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023  [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9)  &amp;#x200B;  The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&amp;P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.  &amp;#x200B;  It‚Äôs an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inflation battle, noted FactSet‚Äôs Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 top performing days for the S&amp;P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday‚Äôs close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%.  &amp;#x200B;  Through Dec. 22, the S&amp;P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&amp;P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.  &amp;#x200B;  Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&amp;P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  That didn‚Äôt mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.  &amp;#x200B;  Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.  &amp;#x200B;  Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.  &amp;#x200B;  The strategy ‚Äúindicates the Fed‚Äôs measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,‚Äù Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&amp;P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks‚Äô bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group‚Äôs announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.  &amp;#x200B;  SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a ‚Äúmini‚Äù banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.  &amp;#x200B;  Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks ‚Äî Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%,  and Meta Platforms Inc.  META, 0.56%.  &amp;#x200B;  See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?  &amp;#x200B;  Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high:  &amp;#x200B;  The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs overall return, he wrote, with the company‚Äôs success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.,;,; 2023-12-27 15:52:27]
[Microsoft ($MSFT), Meta ($META), and Google ($GOOGL) lead earnings waves.,;,;  The stock market rally had another sideways week, with the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq composite all drifting lower in continued tight action. Investors await a flood of earnings headlined by **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**), **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **Meta Platforms** ($**META**) and Google parent **Alphabet** ($**GOOGL**).      Buying opportunities haven't been plentiful, and many have fizzled or failed.¬†Earnings season will hit full force in the coming week, offering the potential for the market rally to break out of its rut.  Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Google are especially important. Microsoft and, arguably, Amazon stock are actionable now. Google stock is close to a buy point while Facebook parent Meta is pulling back after a massive run.  By themselves, they have a big impact on the major indexes. And their comments about future growth in key markets such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, e-commerce and PCs will have a major influence on the tech sector and beyond.

MBLY stock in particular has an action-packed week, with its IPO lockup expiration on Monday followed by earnings on Wednesday.  **Bed Bath &amp; Beyond** ($**BBBY**) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday, with the long-ailing housewares retailer struggling with debts and declining sales. BBBY stock has been plunging for a long time, but the meme stock did jump 23% last week despite the prospect of bankruptcy.  Meanwhile, keep an eye out for news on **Shockwave Medical** ($**SWAV**).

[2 leading tech stocks to buy in 2023 and beyond,;,;    * **Shares of Amazon and Alphabet plunged over 39% in 2022.** * **However, that has only made both companies' shares bargain investments.** * **The potency of their businesses in multiple markets makes their stocks likely to soar over the long term.**   ## Amazon and Alphabet should flourish over the long term, thanks to their positions in AI and cloud computing.   Last year was a terrible one for tech stocks, with hikes in inflation dragging down the entire market. Market leaders **Amazon** **($****AMZN****)** and **Alphabet** **($****GOOG****)** **($****GOOGL****)** experienced stock declines of 50% and 39%, respectively, throughout 2022 as a result.  However, the market has seen a surge in 2023, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing gaining favor with investors. Consequently, companies in these sectors have become increasingly compelling investments before a likely bull run.  Dominant in their respective markets, Amazon and Alphabet have seen their companies flourish over the years, and their potent businesses are likely to keep expanding.  ## 1. Amazon¬†  An economically challenging 2022 caused steep declines in Amazon's e-commerce business, with its North America and international segments reporting a combined $10.6 billion in operating losses in the fiscal year. As a result, the company's stock remains down over 30% year over year, prompting a buying opportunity.  E-commerce remains a steadily growing industry alongside the rise in online retail sales, with temporary headwinds unlikely to affect Amazon's long-term development. In the meantime, Amazon has a thriving cloud business through Amazon Web Services ($AWS), boasting the largest market share at 34%. The COVID-19 pandemic boosted cloud adoption as numerous companies moved online to suit hybrid working styles. In recent months, advances in AI have similarly boosted the industry, with the technology enhancing cloud services and attracting new clients.     https://preview.redd.it/2xk99bup9eua1.png?width=872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f06ec367fdb3458ca29828627eb515f22c2da4b7     Amazon's dominance in the industry led $AWS to generate 100% of the company's profits in 2022, hitting $22.8 billion in operating income.¬†  Recent challenges have brought down Amazon's stock and e-commerce business. However, the company's long-term outlook is positive, and Wall Street seems to agree. Out of 50 analysts, 46 have rated the company's shares a strong buy or buy. Meanwhile, Amazon's average 12-month price target of $137.37 projects a 34% stock rise, making Amazon a no-brainer investment in 2023 and beyond.  ## 2. Alphabet  Last year's sell-off was particularly hard on Alphabet as many businesses slashed their budgets for advertising, the company's primary source of income. Then, the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 sent Alphabet's stock tumbling further, with the AI chatbot posing a threat to Google's majority market share in search engines.  However, the company appears to be back on a growth path. In March, inflation eased for the ninth month in a row, hitting its lowest level since May 2021. Inflation rose 5% last month, down from 6% in February and a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. The news is positive for many tech stocks, including Alphabet. As inflation eases, businesses will be keener to utilize the company's digital advertising services, offering steady revenue growth.   Moreover, Alphabet has responded to the release of ChatGPT and its integration into **Microsoft**'s search engine Bing by pivoting its own business toward AI development. The move has given Alphabet something it has needed for years -- a clear and definitive direction. With little effort, the company has held an over 80% market share in search engines for decades. However, increased competition has lit a fire under Alphabet to retain that market share and develop its rival to ChatGPT, which it calls Bard.     https://preview.redd.it/4ns4g49x9eua1.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a84e7f1f3e216f804bb4a39d53e5962879385519  The launch of Bard in February was discouraging, with the chatbot sharing inaccurate information at its debut and failing to instill confidence in investors. But Alphabet's dominant influence in search grants it some time to improve its own tech and Google remains a formidable opponent -- even for Microsoft's Bing. Over the long term, I wouldn't bet against the Google company taking the lead in generative AI search engines.  Like Amazon, many experts are bullish about Alphabet's stock, with 47 out of 52 analysts rating it a strong buy or buy.  As the home of potent brands such as Android, YouTube, and the many services under Google, Alphabet is a leading tech company with attractive long-term prospects. With a 12-month price target of $125, which is 14% higher than its current position, Alphabet's stock is a must-buy this year.,;,; 2023-04-17 07:16:43]

[Earnings wave, Credit Suisse ($CSGN) outflows, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond ($BBBY) bankruptcy‚Äîwhat's moving markets?,;,; U.S. futures point lower as investors look ahead to a wave of massive corporate earnings this week. Credit Suisse suffers significant first quarter outflows, underlining the challenges surrounding its shotgun marriage with rival UBS, while NBCUniversal's CEO resigns and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond files for bankruptcy.  **1. Futures drop as earnings season kicks into full gear**  High-profile corporate names, including some of the world's biggest technology groups, will unveil their latest results this week as concerns persist over a possible slowdown in the U.S. economy.  Companies faced a tumultuous quarter highlighted by stubbornly elevated (but easing) inflation, widespread tech sector layoffs, and the banking crisis.  Google-parent Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN), and Facebook-owned Meta Platforms, Inc. ($META) are all slated to report, along with chip-making giant Intel ($INTC). Consumer goods firm Mondelez International, Inc. ($MDLZ), oil major ExxonMobil Corp. ($XOM), payments processor Mastercard Inc. ($MA), drinks maker Coca-Cola Company ($KO) and drugmaker Eli Lilly and Company ($LLY) are also among the hundreds of businesses due to release their earnings in the coming days.  Last week, JPMorgan ($JPM) chief Jamie Dimon flagged looming economic "storm clouds" on the horizon, adding that the banking industry's recent issues have only exacerbated these fears. However, these worries were somewhat tempered by separate data on Friday which showed that business activity in the U.S. touched an 11-month high in April.  **2.** **Credit Suisse's 'alarming' results**  Credit Suisse ($CSGN) saw CHF 61.2 billion in asset outflows in the first quarter in what is likely to be the final earnings report from the Swiss lender after its merger with rival UBS Group AG ($UBSG).  The bank called the outflows "significant," adding that they have moderated but not yet reversed.  It said that withdrawals of cash deposits and non-renewal of maturing time deposits were most acute in the days preceding and following the announcement of the tie-up last month. Swiss officials brokered the deal to bolster confidence in the country's banking system in the wake of turmoil across the global financial services sector sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.  Customer deposits also declined by CHF 67B in the opening three months of its 2023 fiscal year.  The results, which analysts at KBW called "alarming," set the stage for quarterly figures from UBS due out tomorrow, with investors keen to find out more about how it plans to fold Credit Suisse into its operations.  "UBS undoubtedly faces a major (and urgent) task in deeply restructuring its former competitor," analysts at Vontobel said in a note on Monday.  **3. NBCUniversal CEO to step down**  NBCUniversal chief Jeff Shell will leave following an investigation reportedly led by an outside counsel into a complaint over inappropriate behavior, the media giant's parent Comcast Corp. ($CMCSA) announced in a note to staff.  In a statement, Shell said he had had an "inappropriate relationship" with a female employee. The woman is believed to be a long-time journalist for the company, according to multiple media reports.  "Today is my last day as CEO of NBCUniversal," Shell said on Sunday. The executive, who is married, added that he deeply regretted the relationship.  Shell's departure comes as a precarious time for NBCUniversal. He had been leading a charge to refocus on the firm's operations as it faced increased competition from streaming rivals.  Senior leaders who had been working under Shell will now report to Comcast president Mike Cavanagh, the note said.  **4. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond files for bankruptcy**  U.S. home goods retailer Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. ($BBBY) has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a New Jersey court after it failed to secure funds needed to continue as a going concern.  The embattled business had attempted to stay afloat through a complex sale of preferred stock and warrants that aimed to raise $1B. However, that deal was scrapped last month, leading the company to announce a last-ditch effort to garner $300 million from investors.  But neither this fundraising drive nor a series of store closures have proven to be enough. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is now expected to use the bankruptcy proceedings to give it time to conduct a liquidation of some or most of its assets. Individual shareholders will likely be wiped out in the process.  Should a bidder for the business come forward, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond said it would pursue a sale and move away from liquidation.  The retail chain, which was once a hugely popular staple of suburban American life, had previously tried to overhaul its operations to combat flagging demand for its privately branded products. This push ultimately proved unfruitful with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond posting a loss of about $393M and a 33% fall in sales in the quarter ended on November 26.  **5. Oil slips amid broader economic fears**  Oil prices dropped, extending their recent decline into this week, as traders eyed a darkening outlook for global demand.  Concerns remain that rising interest rates will lead to a broader economic slowdown, particularly in the U.S. economy, the world's biggest consumer of crude.  By 04:17 EST (08:17 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.51% lower at $77.47 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell by 0.56% to $81.00 per barrel.  Last week, crude markets slumped to their first weekly loss in five, after data showed that the U.S. implied gasoline demand dropped by 3.9% compared to the same period last year.,;,; 2023-04-25 09:35:25]

If there is some volatility, it‚Äôs more likely to be a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù correction of between 5% and 15% that sets the market up for a better second half, she said on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell: Overtime.‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚ÄúWe do think we‚Äôre headed toward a period of consolidation, maybe some volatility,‚Äù she said, highlighting earnings, market expectations of Fed policy and a slowdown in lending amid the banking crises as three incremental headwinds. ***** &gt; On Tuesday investors will get the latest number from the monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, at 10 a.m. ET.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/PcKA8En.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hEqaSqz.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/aLIWmoI.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/0v7CXuP.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/XbT9sdN.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$SAIC $CAG $LW $AYI $STZ $FLGC $MSM $OCX $DLO $RPM $LEVI $SMPL $LNN $APLD $SCHN $EGY $IONM $KRUS $GNLN $SGH $RELL $WDFC $FRLN $SNAX $ZENV $CLIR $RGP $SLP $SDRL $NG*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5Y8HITW.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$GNLN $AYI $MSM $LNN $FRLN $AIRI*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XVlHAPL.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/yAlDpk5.png)**)  *****  #THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Ybj8H06.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/1IeDg6F.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/avTKCpl.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Yol79ya.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/Cvt0f27.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/cFbtpIO.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:  * AMC * DOGE.X * GFAI * NOGN * SHIB.X * GOOGL * PLUG * AMZN * MWG * ZIM  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/04/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-etsy-boeing-tesla-and-more.html)**)  *****  &gt; **Etsy** ‚Äî The e-commerce company‚Äôs shares rose 3.9% after Piper Sandler upgraded them to overweight from neutral.

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023.  # **Stocks close higher Friday as investors try to shake off latest bank fears: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/stock-futures-are-up-slightly-as-investors-weigh-bank-troubles-fed-decision.html)** ***** &gt; Stocks rose Friday, reversing their earlier session declines as Deutsche Bank shares pared back some losses. ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 132.28 points, or 0.41%, closing at 32,238.15. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.57%, while Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.3%. The major indexes all had a winning week, with the Dow gaining 0.4% week-to-date as of Friday afternoon, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq gained 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively. ***** &gt; Deutsche Bank‚Äôs U.S.-listed shares slid 3.11% Friday, rebounding from a 7% drop earlier in the trading session. A selloff of shares was triggered after the the German lender‚Äôs credit default swaps jumped, but without an apparent catalyst. The move appeared to raise concerns once again over the health of the European banking industry. Earlier this month, Swiss regulators forced a UBS acquisition of rival Credit Suisse. Deutsche Bank shares traded off their worst levels of the session, which caused major U.S. indexes to also cut their losses. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think that the market overall is neither frightened nor optimistic ‚Äî it‚Äôs simply confused,‚Äù said George Ball, president at Sanders Morris Harris. ‚ÄúThe price action for the last month-and-a-half, including today, is a jumble without any direction or conviction.‚Äù ***** &gt; Ball added that Deutsche Bank is ‚Äúvery sound financially.‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIt could be crippled if there‚Äôs a big loss of confidence and there‚Äôs a run on the bank. There is, however, no fundamental reason why that should occur, other than nervousness.‚Äù ***** &gt; European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde tried to ease concerns, saying euro zone banks are resilient with strong capital and liquidity positions. Lagarde said the ECB could provide liquidity if needed. ***** &gt; Investors continued to assess the Fed‚Äôs latest policy move announced this week. The central bank hiked rates by a quarter-point. However, it also hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be ending soon. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that credit conditions have tightened, which could put pressure on the economy. ***** &gt; On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said regulators are prepared to take more action if needed to stabilize U.S. banks. Her comments are the latest among regulators attempting to buoy confidence in the U.S. banking system in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank closures. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúRetail [and] institutional investors are both looking at the banking system, but now internationally. That‚Äôs dangerous,‚Äù Ball added. ‚ÄúBanks exist because of confidence in their stability, and that confidence can be eroded as we now see, via social media and technology in a matter of minutes.‚Äù  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kYFZ0mb.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/sa1yxWq.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/QsHW7no.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/OGQZBeP.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/uIef67v.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kr3YfHV.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JiYUEBP.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CKcDnul.png))**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vsFHgKf.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mconM20.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H7KFVcz.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ymKQozZ.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TsJcX1J.png))**   *****  &gt; # Best and Worst Stocks Since the COVID Crash Low  &gt; We are now three years out from the COVID Crash low, and even with the past year's weakness, most assets continue to sit on solid gains. For major US index ETFs, the S&amp;P Midcap 400 (IJH) is up the most having slightly more than doubled while the S&amp;P Smallcap 600 (IJR) is not far behind having rallied 95.9%. Value has generally outperformed growth, especially for mid and small-caps although that has shifted somewhat this year. For example, while its gains have been more middling since the COVID crash, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has been the strongest area of the equity market in 2023 thanks to the strength of sectors like Tech (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC). Although those sectors have posted strong gains this year, they have been the weakest over the past three years while Energy (XLE) far and away has been the strongest asset class. Paired with the strength of energy stocks has been solid runs in commodities (DBC)more broadly with the notable exception being Natural Gas (UNG) which has lost over 40%. Bond ETFs are similarly sitting on losses since the COVID Crash lows. As for international markets, Mexico (EWW) and India (PIN) have outpaced the rest of the world although Emerging Markets (EEM) as a whole have not been particularly strong; likely being dragged on by the weaker performance of China (ASHR) which holds a large weight on EEM.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low.png))**  &gt; Taking a look at current S&amp;P 500 members, nearly half of the index has more than doubled over the past three years. As for the absolute best performers, Energy stocks dominate the list with four of the top five best-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks coming from that sector. Targa Resources (TRGP) has been the absolute best performer with a nearly 900% total return. Other notables include a couple of heavy weight stocks: Tesla (TSLA) and NVIDIA (NVDA) with gains of 563.9% and 412.9%, respectively.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low-2.png))**  &gt; On the other end of the spectrum, there are currently 25 stocks that have posted a negative return since the COVID Crash low. The worst has been First Republic Bank (FRC) which has been more of a recent development. Whereas today the stock has posted an 83.1% loss, at the start of this month it would have been a 65% gain. Another standout on the list of worst performers has been Amazon (AMZN). Most other mega caps have more than doubled since the March 2020 S&amp;P 500 low, however, the e-commerce giant has hardly offered a positive return.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # Sector Performance Experiences a Historical Divergence  &gt; The first quarter of 2023 is coming to a close next week, and checking in on year to date performance, there has been a big divergence between the winners and losers. Although the S&amp;P 500 is up 2.84% on the year as of yesterday's close, only three of the eleven sectors are higher. Not only are those three sectors up on the year, but they have posted impressive double digit gains only three months into the year. Of those three, Consumer Discretionary has posted the smallest gain of 10% whereas Technology and Communication Services have risen 17.2% and 18.1%, respectively. The fact that these sectors are home to the main mega cap stocks -- like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have been on an impressive run of late -- helps to explain how the market cap weighted S&amp;P 500 is up on the year without much in the way of healthy breadth on a sector level.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-1a.png))**  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-1.png))**  &gt; One thing that is particularly remarkable about this year's sector performance is just how rare it is for a sector to be up 10%+ (let alone 3) while all other sectors are lower. And that is for any point of the year let alone in the first quarter. As we mentioned in yesterday's Sector Snapshot and show in the charts below, going back to 1990, there have only been two other periods in which a sector has risen at least 10% YTD while all other sectors were lower YTD. The first of those was in May 2009. In a similar instance to now, Consumer Discretionary, Tech, and Materials were the three sectors with double digit gains back then. With those sectors up solidly, the S&amp;P 500 was little changed on the year with a less than 1% gain. As you can see below, though, by the end of 2009, every sector had pushed into positive territory as the new bull market coming out of the global financial crisis was well underway.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-2.png))**  &gt; The next occurrence was much more recent: 2022. Obviously, it was a tough year for equities except for the Energy sector which had a banner year. Throughout most of the year, the sector traded up by well over 20% year to date even while the rest of the equity market was battered.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # The Fed Expects Banking Stress to Substitute for Rate Hikes  &gt; The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 0.25% at their March meeting, bringing it to the 4.75-5.0% range. This is the ninth-straight rate increase and brings rates to their highest level since 2007. However, the most aggressive tightening cycle since the early 1980s, which saw them lift rates all the way from near zero to almost 5%, is near its end.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-target-rate-601x800.png))**  &gt; Up until early February, Fed officials expected to raise rates to a maximum of about 5.1% and hold it there for a while. However, since that time, we‚Äôve gotten a slew of strong economic data, including elevated inflation numbers. This pushed fed officials to give ‚Äúguidance‚Äù that they expected to raise rates by more than they estimated back in December.  &gt; Market expectations for policy also moved in conjunction. Prior to February, markets expected the Fed to raise rates to 5% by June, and subsequently lower them by about 0.5% by the end of the year. But strong incoming data and Fed guidance pushed expectations higher, with the terminal rate moving up to 5.6% and no cuts in 2023.  &gt; # The Silicon Valley Bank crisis changed everything &gt; The bank crisis that erupted over the last couple of weeks resulted in a significant shift, both in expectations for policy and now the Fed as well. See here for our complete rundown on SVB and the ensuing crisis.  &gt; Market expectations for Fed policy rates immediately moved lower. Markets expected the stress in banks to translate to tighter credit conditions, which in turn would lead to slower economic growth and lower inflation.  &gt; This was nicely articulated by Professor Jeremey Siegel, one of the foremost commentators on financial markets and fed policy, in our latest episode of the Facts vs Feelings podcast, Prof. Siegel said that tighter credit conditions, as lending standards become more strict, are de facto rate hikes.  &gt; Fed Chair Powell more or less said exactly the same thing after the Fed‚Äôs March meeting. The 0.25% increase was an attempt to thread the needle between financial stability and fighting inflation. Fed officials also forecast the fed funds rate to hit a maximum of 5.1%, unchanged from their December estimate. This is a marked shift from what was expected just a few weeks ago, with Powell explicitly saying that tighter credit conditions ‚Äúsubstitute‚Äù for rate hikes.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-rate-expectations-600x800.png))**  &gt; # There‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty ahead &gt; While the recent bank stresses are expected to tighten credit conditions and thereby impact economic growth and inflation, there are a couple of open questions:  &gt; * How big will the impact be?  &gt; * How long will the impact last?  &gt; These are unknown currently. Which means future policy is also unknown.  &gt; Fed officials expect to take rates to 5.1%, i.e., one more rate increase. And then expect to hold it there through the end of the year. In short, they don‚Äôt expect rate cuts this year.  &gt; Yet investors expect no more rate increases and about 0.6% of rate cuts in the second half of 2023. Markets expect the policy rate in June to be at 4.8%, while expectations for December are at 4.2%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-implied-policy-rate-differential-600x800.png))**  &gt; There‚Äôs clearly a huge gulf between what the Fed expects versus what investors expect. This will have to reconcile in one of two ways:  &gt; * Market expectations move higher ‚Äì if economic/inflation data remain strong and credit conditions don‚Äôt look to be tightening significantly.  &gt; * Fed expectations move lower ‚Äì if the banking sector comes under renewed stress, credit conditions could tighten significantly and eventually lead to weaker data.  &gt; Things are obviously not going to go in either direction in a straight line. It‚Äôs going to be a bumpy ride as new data points come in, not to mention news/rumors of renewed problems in the banking sector.  *****  &gt; # Seasonality Keeps Claims Below 200K?  &gt; Initial jobless claims remained healthy this week with another sub-200K print. Claims fell modestly to 191K from last week's unrevised reading of 192K. That small decline exceeded expectations of claims rising up to 197K. Given claims continue to impress, the seasonally adjusted number has come in below 200K for 9 of the last 10 weeks. By that measure, it has been the strongest stretch for claims since last April when there were 10 weeks in a row of sub-200K prints. Prior to that, from 2018 through 2020 the late March and early April period similarly saw consistent readings under 200K meaning that some of the strength in the adjusted number could be on account of residual seasonality.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-1.png))**  &gt; In fact, this point of the year has some of the weeks in which claims have the most consistently historically fallen week over week. Taking a historical median of claims throughout the year, claims tend to round out a short-term bottom in the spring before an early summer bump. In other words, seasonal strength will begin to wane in the coming months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-2.png))**  &gt; While initial claims improved, continuing claims worsened rising to 1.694 million from 1.68 million the previous week. Albeit higher, that remains below the 2023 high of 1.715 million set at the end of February.  *****  &gt; # A Fed Day Like Most Others  &gt; Yesterday's Fed decision and comments from Fed Chair Powell gave markets plenty to chew on. As we discussed in last night's Closer and today's Morning Lineup, there have been a number of conflicting statements from officials and confusing reactions in various assets over the past 24 hours. In spite of all that uncertainty, the S&amp;P 500's path yesterday pretty much followed the usual script. In the charts below we show the S&amp;P's average intraday pattern across all Fed days since Powell has been chair (first chart) and the intraday chart of the S&amp;P yesterday (second chart). As shown, the market's pattern yesterday, especially after the 2 PM ET rate decision and the 2:30 PM press conference, closely resembled the average path that the market has followed across all Powell Fed Days since 2018.  &gt; The S&amp;P saw a modest bounce after the 2 PM Fed decision and then a further rally right after Powell's presser began at 2:30 PM. That initial post-presser spike proved to be a pump-fake, as markets ultimately sold off hard with a near 2% decline from 2:30 PM to the 4 PM close.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-1a.png))**  &gt; So what typically happens in the week after Fed days? Since 1994 when the Fed began announcing policy decisions on the same day as its meeting, the S&amp;P has averaged a decline of 10 basis points over the next week. During the current tightening cycle that began about a year ago, market performance in the week after Fed days has been even worse with the S&amp;P averaging a decline of 0.99%. However, when the S&amp;P has been down over 1% on Fed days (like yesterday), performance over the next week has been positive with an average gain of 0.64%. As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-3.png))**  *****   &gt; # What Now? An Update on Recent Bank Stress.  &gt; It‚Äôs been less than 2 weeks since Silicon Valley Bank‚Äôs stunning 48-hour collapse, and a few more banks have been caught in the fray. New York regulators closed the doors on Signature Bank on Sunday, March 12. A week later, US banks injected $30 billion into First Republic Bank to keep it afloat, and UBS acquired rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse in a government-brokered deal. In the midst of the chaos, your Carson Investment Research team was there for you with client-facing content, professional advice, and investment solutions. In fact, we think this event presents an opportunity to invest in the more stable large-cap financial companies and recently upgraded the sector to overweight in our House Views Advice.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mar22_1-1600x927.png))**  &gt; # Why is this happening? &gt; The rapid hike in interest rates caused an asset and liability mismatch for banks. Due to many years of low-interest rates, banks invested assets in interest-earning loans and bonds that would be repaid over the next five-plus years, which at the time was a logical way to earn a higher yield. Regulators considered government bonds to be among the safest ways a bank could invest its capital. As interest rates rose, bond values dropped. Interest rates rose at the fastest pace in history, and the safe assets that banks invested in lost value to the tune of more than $620 billion in unrealized losses as of the end of last year. This decline in value left weaker banks underwater and, when coupled with depositors pulling money out, caused them to collapse or seek costly capital raises.  &gt; # Why this matters to investors? &gt; The weakness in the banking sector will likely lead to tighter lending standards, potentially slowing economic growth. The reason we‚Äôre in this mess, to begin with, is that the Fed hiked interest rates to slow the economy because inflation was rising too quickly. Perhaps the 16% drop in oil prices over the past two weeks reflected this slower growth and bodes well for continued falling inflation. Thus, the Fed is closer to achieving its goal.  &gt; Maybe it‚Äôs an overreaction as ‚Äúbanking crisis‚Äù headlines stir painful memories of 2008. Either way, an environment with slower growth and lower inflation isn‚Äôt a bad time to invest. Bonds and stocks could both perform well, especially stocks of companies with the ability to grow earnings. We also reiterate our House Views Advice overweight on the large-cap Financials sector. The largest US banks are well-capitalized and are gaining market share from the smaller regional banks. We believe this calamity provides an opportunity for stronger banks and investors to capitalize on.  *****  &gt; # FANG+ Flying  &gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup, sector performance has heavily favored areas like Tech, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services in recent weeks. Playing into that sector level performance has been the strength of the mega-caps. The NYSE FANG+ index tracks ten of the largest and most highly traded Tech and Tech-adjacent names. In the past several days, that cohort of stocks is breaking out to the highest level since last April whereas the S&amp;P 500 still needs to rally 4% to reach its February high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-1.png))**  &gt; Although FANG+ stocks have been strong recently, that follows more than a full year of underperformance. As shown below, relative to the S&amp;P 500, mega-cap Tech consistently underperformed from February 2021 through this past fall. In the past few days, the massive outperformance has resulted in a breakout of the downtrend for the ratio of FANG+ to the S&amp;P 500.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-2.png))**  &gt; More impressive is how rapid of a move it has been for that ratio to break out. Below, we show the 2-month percent change in the ratio above. As of the high at yesterday's close, the ratio had risen 22.5% over the prior two months. That comes up just short of the record (22.6%) leading up to the pre-COVID high in February 2020. In other words, mega-cap Tech has experienced near-record outperformance relative to the broader market. However, we would note that this is in the wake of last year when the group had seen some of its worst two-month underperformance on record with the worst readings being in March, May, and November.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # March Seasonality Prevails, Banking Fiasco Be Damned  &gt; It‚Äôs encouraging typical March seasonal patterns have overcome recent bank failures, recession talk and fearmongering. The early March pullback was steeper than normal, but the usual mid-month rebound appears to be materializing.  &gt; Last week‚Äôs gains could be an indication we have seen the worst of the banking fallout and the end of the pullback. Triple Witching Weeks have tended to be down in flat periods and dramatically so during bear markets. Positive March Triple Witching weeks in 2003 and 2009 confirmed the market was back in rally mode.  &gt; The week after March Triple Witching is notoriously nasty. S&amp;P is down 27 of the last 40 year ‚Äì and frequently down sharply. Positive or flat action this week would be constructive.  &gt; In the old days March used to come in like a bull and out like a bear. Nowadays March has evolved into an inflection point where short-term trends often change course. The market is clearly at an important juncture and it‚Äôs a good time to remember Warren Buffet‚Äôs wise words to ‚ÄúBe greedy when others are fearful.‚Äù  &gt; Bank failures are never a good thing, but the swift actions of regulators likely prevented further damage to the industry. At the least, the banks are likely to be under even greater scrutiny going forward. In the near-term we expect more volatile trading. Further out we expect the market, and the economy will recover like they both have historically done.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5fe6f3377343f819ff93c97e8aeb8ffc/1258a39f06bd18c7-63/s500x750/303b38d927e1a424f5dc254dd086678978f2cc12.jpg))**  *****  &gt; # Nasdaq Leaves the S&amp;P in the Dust  &gt; Looking at the major US index ETF screen of our Trend Analyzer shows just how disconnected the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has become from other major index ETFs recently. As shown below, as of Friday's close, QQQ actually finished in overbought territory (over 1 standard above its 50-DMA) whereas many other major index ETFs were oversold, some of those to an extreme degree. On a year to date basis, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has rallied more than 14% compared to low single digit gains or losses for the rest of the pack.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/usindexqqq.png))**  &gt; Historically, the major indices, namely the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, tend to trade at similar overbought and oversold levels. In the chart below we show the Nasdaq 100 and S&amp;P 500's distance from their 50-DMAs (expressed in standard deviations) over the past five years. As shown, typically the two large cap indices have seen similar albeit not identical readings. That is until the past few weeks in which the two have diverged more significantly.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**  &gt; On Friday there was more than 2 standard deviations between the Nasdaq's overbought 50-DMA spread and the S&amp;P 500's oversold spread. As shown in the chart below, that surpassed recent highs in the spread like the spring of 2020 to set the highest reading since October 2016.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**  &gt; Going back to 1985, the spread between the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 50-DMA spreads diverging to such a degree is not without precedent, but it is also not exactly common. Friday marked the 16th time that spread eclipsed 2 standard deviations for the first time in at least 3 months. Relative to those prior instances, the current overbought and oversold readings in both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are relatively middling. However, only the instance in early 2000 similarly saw the Nasdaq technically overbought (trading at least a standard deviation above its 50-DMA) while the S&amp;P 500 was simultaneously oversold (at least one standard deviation below its 50-DMA).  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 24th, 2023**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JnEIcSYZEM))**  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3/26/23**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; (*$CCL $BNTX $LULU $MU $IZEA $SKLZ $WBA $HTHT $FUTU $LOVE $RH $PAYX $IHS $GOEV $CALM $PLAY $RUM $CTAS $CNM $MKC $BB $EVGO $VERO $AUGX $RGF $GMDA $SNX $RAIL $AEHR $PVH $SRT $UGRO $AADI $PRGS $DNMR $NEOG $CONN $IMBI $SOL $LOV $GROY $EE $ABOS $CNXC $UNF $AMPS $JEF $ESLT $CURI $DARE*)  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/mconM20.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/B9lJ6yg.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/kQxLMVP.png))**  *****  &gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).  &gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))  *****  # DISCUSS!

[Amazon has a P/E over 250x. Can someone explain this to me?,;,; Earnings just came out, and it wasn't bad. In line with expectations. They made about $3b in profit. They obviously have a strong marketshare in cloud, and that isn't going anywhere any time soon. I can say this safely as a software dev. They could raise their prices 25% and I know that would not be enough to get the company I work for to switch to anything else.   That being said, a P/E of anything over 50x seems crazy to me. 250 would be for a smaller company, growing exponentially. What are people predicting about the future of Amazon that they should be worth so much? Their retail business is low margin, and that isn't changing any time soon.   Is there some sort of expectation of exponential growth in profit? I just really don't get it. This seems crazy overvalued to me, and people just buy Amazon because it's a big name and that's it. As good as AWS is, there shouldn't be any prediction of wild growth. If anything they could lose a little bit of market share going forward.   What am I missing here?,;,; 2023-05-16 13:27:03]

According to Yahoo Finance, stocks are predominantly in the green this Friday afternoon, and robust earnings have been a key driver behind the historic crossing of the 5,000 threshold by the S&amp;P 500.

[Lyft CEO and president to step down and former Amazon exec David Risher named as new CEO,;,; It's interesting to note that [Lyft](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-LYFT/)'s shares rose around 5% after hours on the news of a new CEO, which indicates a positive reaction from the market.  It's worth mentioning that Lyft has faced significant challenges in the past year, with its shares falling more than 70%. However, the appointment of a new CEO may signal a change in the company's direction and a potential for growth. John Zimmer and Logan Green founded Lyft in 2012 and took the company public in 2019. Their decision to step back from day-to-day operations and appoint a new CEO, Jenn Risher, may indicate a desire to bring fresh ideas and perspectives to the company's leadership.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ibvwupdg2hqa1.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6197c456460e545d95e517ad9c2d067df0308c37  It will be interesting to see what changes Risher will bring to the company and how [Lyft](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-LYFT/) will fare in the coming months under her leadership. Paul Risher's experience as Amazon's first vice president of product and store development and senior vice president of marketing and merchandising would provide him with valuable insights into the e-commerce industry, which could be beneficial to Lyft. As a board member, Risher could provide guidance and strategic advice to Lyft's management team. It would be interesting to see how his expertise and experience would contribute to Lyft's growth and success in the ride-hailing industry.  In an email to MarketWatch, D.A. Davidson analyst Tom White suggested that the change in leadership at [Lyft](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-LYFT/) could potentially have a positive impact on the company's business strategy. According to White, a new leader with a wider range of experiences could indicate a greater willingness to explore new business opportunities and expand the company's offerings beyond ride-hailing services. This could include exploring adjacent products like delivery services, forming new partnerships, and finding innovative ways to create value for customers. Overall, White sees the change in leadership as a potentially positive development for Lyft's future growth and success.,;,; 2023-03-28 12:19:04]

[AMZN Q2 2023 Earnings Report,;,;    \*\* I'm for whatever reason, enjoying going through the documents and attempting to make it easier to digest and read. I just started doing this so any feedback would be appreciated. Goal is for a quick overview of the earnings report for an average person to be able to read and digest\*\*  1. Operating Activities:  The operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows showcases how Amazon generates cash from its core business operations. In both periods, the company's operating activities generated positive cash flow. There was a significant increase in net income, showing growth from a loss of $2.03 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. This highlights a remarkable improvement in Amazon's financial performance and operational efficiency.  2. Investing Activities:  Amazon invested heavily in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions during the analyzed periods. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, the company's investments in property and equipment amounted to $15.72 billion, which decreased to $11.45 billion in the same period in 2023. While the absolute values decreased, these investments are essential for the company's long-term growth and expansion.  3. Financing Activities:  The financing activities section details Amazon's capital structure and shareholder returns. The company engaged in various financing activities, including repurchasing common stock, resulting in cash outflows of $3.33 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2023, and $6 billion in the six months ending June 30, 2022. Additionally, the company obtained proceeds from short-term debt and other financing, contributing $4.87 billion and $4.4 billion in the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. Investors should be aware of these activities, as they impact the company's capital allocation strategy.  4. Cash Position:  Amazon maintained a strong cash position, reflecting its financial stability and liquidity. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased steadily over the periods, reaching $50.07 billion at the end of the twelve months ending June 30, 2023. This signifies the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations and pursue growth opportunities.  5. Debt and Interest Payments:  The company managed its debt obligations efficiently, making principal repayments on long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations. Amazon also paid interest on debt, with cash outflows totaling $349 million and $954 million for the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. These payments demonstrate responsible debt management and the company's commitment to meeting its financial obligations.  6. Net Sales:  Net sales are a fundamental indicator of Amazon's revenue growth and market performance. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, net sales reached $121.23 billion, which increased to $134.38 billion in the same period in 2023, representing an 11% year-over-year growth. Similarly, for the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net sales grew from $237.68 billion to $261.74 billion, showing strong and consistent revenue growth.  7. Operating Expenses:  Operating expenses provide insights into the company's cost structure and efficiency. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, operating expenses were $117.92 billion, which increased to $126.70 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating expenses increased from $230.69 billion to $249.29 billion, primarily due to higher fulfillment, technology, and infrastructure costs. Despite the increase, Amazon's revenue growth outpaced the rise in operating expenses, leading to improved operating income.  8. Operating Income:  Operating income measures the profitability of Amazon's core operations. The company experienced significant growth in operating income, increasing from $3.32 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to $7.68 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating income rose from $6.99 billion to $12.46 billion, indicating improved operational efficiency and profitability.  9. Non-Operating Expense:  The non-operating expense provides insights into Amazon's other income and expenses outside its core operations. Total non-operating expense decreased from ($5.97) billion to ($0.12) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. This decline was primarily due to a positive swing in other income (expense), net, indicating favorable financial management.  10. Net Income (Loss):  Net income is a critical metric that assesses Amazon's overall financial performance. The company experienced a significant improvement in net income, increasing from a loss of ($2.03) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net income increased from a loss of ($5.87) billion to a profit of $9.92 billion, demonstrating a strong financial turnaround.  11. Earnings Per Share (EPS):  Earnings per share is a vital metric for shareholders, as it represents the company's profitability on a per-share basis. Basic earnings per share increased from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.66 for the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. Diluted earnings per share showed similar growth, rising from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.65 for the same periods.  12. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):  Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items that impact the company's financial position but are not part of the net income calculation. For the three months ending June 30, 2022, Amazon's other comprehensive income was ($2.42) billion, which increased to $293 million for the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, other comprehensive income was ($3.41) billion and $807 million, respectively.  13. Comprehensive Income (Loss):  Comprehensive income is the total change in equity during a period, including net income and other comprehensive income. For the three months ending June 30, 2022, Amazon reported a comprehensive loss of ($4.45) billion, which improved to a comprehensive income of $7.04 billion for the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, comprehensive loss improved from ($9.28) billion to a comprehensive income of $8.33 billion, highlighting the company's financial recovery.  14. Segment Information:  Amazon operates through several segments, including North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, all segments showed significant growth in net sales.  ‚Ä¢ North America: Net sales in North America increased from $80.85 billion to $87.75 billion, representing a 9% year-over-year growth.  ‚Ä¢ International: Net sales in the International segment grew from $31.9 billion to $37.4 billion, reflecting a 17% year-over-year growth.  ‚Ä¢ AWS: Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud computing segment, experienced remarkable growth, with net sales increasing from $16.37 billion to $20.2 billion, showing a 23% year-over-year growth.  Conclusion:  Amazon demonstrated robust financial performance and growth in the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. The company's operating activities generated positive cash flow, and net sales increased consistently across all segments. Investments in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions reflect Amazon's focus on long-term growth and expansion.  Although the financing activities included cash outflows related to stock repurchases, the company's strong cash position and responsible debt management position Amazon well for future growth. The substantial improvement in net income and operating income signifies improved financial performance and operational efficiency.  PROs &amp; CONs:  Pros:  ‚Ä¢ Strong Revenue Growth: Amazon has consistently demonstrated strong revenue growth across its various segments. The company's ability to expand its customer base, introduce new products and services, and leverage its e-commerce platform has led to impressive financial performance.  ‚Ä¢ Diversification of Business Segments: Amazon has successfully diversified its business beyond e-commerce. The expansion into cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been a major growth driver, providing the company with a stable and profitable source of revenue.  ‚Ä¢ Innovative and Customer-Centric Approach: Amazon's relentless focus on customer satisfaction, innovative technologies like Amazon Prime, and personalized shopping experiences have helped the company build a loyal customer base and maintain a competitive edge in the market.  ‚Ä¢ Financial Stability and Liquidity: The company maintains a strong cash position and prudent debt management, providing it with the financial flexibility to invest in new ventures and navigate economic uncertainties.  ‚Ä¢ Global Reach: Amazon operates in numerous countries, allowing it to tap into diverse markets and consumer preferences worldwide. Its vast international presence positions the company for further growth and market dominance.  ‚Ä¢ Leading Cloud Service Provider: AWS is a dominant force in the cloud computing industry, serving a wide range of clients, from startups to large enterprises. The profitability and growth of AWS contribute significantly to Amazon's overall financial success.  Cons:  ‚Ä¢ Regulatory Scrutiny: Amazon faces increasing regulatory scrutiny related to its market dominance and business practices. Antitrust concerns and accusations of unfair competition may lead to potential legal challenges and fines.  ‚Ä¢ Labor Practices: The company has faced criticism for its labor practices, including allegations of poor working conditions and treatment of employees at its fulfillment centers. Such negative publicity can impact Amazon's reputation and may affect its ability to attract and retain talent.  ‚Ä¢ Highly Competitive Markets: The e-commerce and cloud computing industries are highly competitive, with major players vying for market share. Amazon faces challenges from established competitors and emerging startups, requiring continuous investment in innovation and technology.  ‚Ä¢ Dependence on Global Supply Chain: Amazon's vast supply chain network is critical for delivering products to customers. Any disruptions, such as those caused by geopolitical events or natural disasters, could affect the company's operations and financial performance.  ‚Ä¢ Profit Margins: While Amazon experiences strong revenue growth, its profit margins have historically been relatively low. Intense competition and ongoing investments in new ventures can put pressure on the company's profitability.  ‚Ä¢ Environmental Impact: As a large-scale retailer and cloud services provider, Amazon's operations have an environmental impact. The company has faced criticism for its carbon footprint, and there are growing expectations from stakeholders for more significant efforts towards sustainability.  TLDR;  Amazon recent earnings report for the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, reveals a robust financial performance and impressive revenue growth across its segments. The company generated positive cash flow from operating activities, showing a significant increase in net income, indicating improved financial health and operational efficiency. Amazon's strategic investments in property, equipment, and acquisitions demonstrate a focus on long-term growth and expansion. With a strong cash position and responsible debt management, the company exhibits financial stability and flexibility. However, regulatory scrutiny, labor practices, and intense competition pose potential challenges. Despite these, Amazon remains a leading player in the e-commerce and cloud computing industries, presenting attractive prospects for investors seeking exposure to a market-dominant, innovative, and customer-centric company with a history of success and growth.,;,; 2023-08-04 00:04:45]

Basically what im trying to ask is if you think AMZN could be the same kind of core position that AAPL has been for many years. Looking at holding Amazon basically forever,;,; 2023-08-30 07:43:02]
[$AMZN vs. $SHOP: Which e-commerce stock is better?,;,; ## Amazon ($AMZN)  After eight years of profitability, Amazon lost money in 2022, weighed down by investments like its 20% stake in the EV maker Rivian, whose value plunged in 2022. Between the punishment doled out by investors over the last year or so and its soaring valuation during the pandemic, there‚Äôs a lot of noise affecting Amazon shares. After considering those impacts, a bullish view still looks appropriate for the long term.  To deal with its $2.7 billion loss in 2022, Amazon began a raft of cost-cutting measures, including halting its experimental projects, cutting 18,000 jobs, and pausing grocery store growth. Those moves should benefit the company over the long run because 2022 served as a sort of wake-up call: even tech behemoths aren‚Äôt invincible.  However, when we look more closely at Amazon‚Äôs valuation relative to its history, it becomes clear that it may take some time for the bull thesis to play out. On the one hand, growth and momentum investors have been in love with the e-commerce giant for years, especially during the pandemic, when online shopping received a major push forward.  On the other hand, value investors would argue that Amazon has spent much of its publicly-traded life overvalued. The good news is that the company looks undervalued on some measures. For instance, it‚Äôs currently trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 2.0 versus its mean P/S of about 3.6 over the last five years.  Also, Amazon‚Äôs stock and valuation have come down a lot since the pandemic, when it traded at a P/S ratio of 5.0 and above. Additionally, it‚Äôs trading slightly above its pre-pandemic stock price but below its pre-pandemic P/S of about 4.0 to 4.5, also suggesting a long-term bullish view.  ## What is the Price Target for AMZN Stock?¬†  Amazon has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 35 Buys, one Hold, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $135.88, the¬†average Amazon stock price target implies upside potential of about 30%.  ## Shopify ($SHOP)  A review of Shopify‚Äôs stock price action reveals similarities with Amazon‚Äôs. However, there is a critical difference between them. Although Shopify did manage to turn a profit in 2020 and 2021, probably due to the pandemic, it became far more unprofitable in 2022 than it was before the pandemic. Overall, SHOP‚Äôs fundamentals and valuation suggest a bearish view might be appropriate.  Like Amazon, Shopify was pummeled by its investments in 2022. For example, it took a massive $1 billion non-cash loss in the second quarter alone as a write-down of its equity investments, accounting for nearly all of that quarter‚Äôs loss. Unfortunately, the investment-related losses may be masking a larger issue.  Shopify‚Äôs research and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses soared to $1.5 billion (about 43% higher year-over-year) and $1.73 billion (30% growth), respectively, in 2022. However, its gross profit only rose 11% from 2021, while its revenues grew only 21.4%.  Finally, although its valuation has plummeted, Shopify still looks grossly overvalued at a P/S ratio of 12.3, relative to the stronger, larger Amazon. Shopify‚Äôs mean P/S over the last five years is 31.1, but that just shows that it‚Äôs been overvalued for years.  ## What is the Price Target for SHOP Stock?  Shopify has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 11 Buys, 18 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $49.44, the¬†average Shopify stock price target implies upside potential of 1.6%.  ## Conclusion: Long-Term Bullish on $AMZN, Bearish on$ SHOP  Investor sentiment has long played a significant role in Amazon‚Äôs and Shopify‚Äôs valuations. However, it looks like investors have valued Shopify as if it‚Äôs the next Amazon rather than based on its own fundamentals. Thus, Amazon looks like the clear winner.  Unfortunately, Amazon may have a challenging time in the stock market in the near term due to the possibility of a recession, but the company has staying power and should eventually come roaring back. The key caveat is that a better entry price might materialize, but even at current levels, Amazon looks undervalued when factoring in its long-term potential and historical valuation.,;,; 2023-04-21 09:54:05]

Market leaders **Amazon** **($****AMZN****)** and **Alphabet** **($****GOOG****)** **($****GOOGL****)** experienced stock declines of 50% and 39%, respectively, throughout 2022 as a result.  However, the market has seen a surge in 2023, with industries like artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing gaining favor with investors. Consequently, companies in these sectors have become increasingly compelling investments before a likely bull run.

Amazon¬†  An economically challenging 2022 caused steep declines in Amazon's e-commerce business, with its North America and international segments reporting a combined $10.6 billion in operating losses in the fiscal year. As a result, the company's stock remains down over 30% year over year, prompting a buying opportunity.  E-commerce remains a steadily growing industry alongside the rise in online retail sales, with temporary headwinds unlikely to affect Amazon's long-term development. In the meantime, Amazon has a thriving cloud business through Amazon Web Services ($AWS), boasting the largest market share at 34%. The COVID-19 pandemic boosted cloud adoption as numerous companies moved online to suit hybrid working styles. In recent months, advances in AI have similarly boosted the industry, with the technology enhancing cloud services and attracting new clients.     https://preview.redd.it/2xk99bup9eua1.png?width=872&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f06ec367fdb3458ca29828627eb515f22c2da4b7     Amazon's dominance in the industry led $AWS to generate 100% of the company's profits in 2022, hitting $22.8 billion in operating income.¬†  Recent challenges have brought down Amazon's stock and e-commerce business. However, the company's long-term outlook is positive, and Wall Street seems to agree. Out of 50 analysts, 46 have rated the company's shares a strong buy or buy. Meanwhile, Amazon's average 12-month price target of $137.37 projects a 34% stock rise, making Amazon a no-brainer investment in 2023 and beyond.  ## 2. Alphabet  Last year's sell-off was particularly hard on Alphabet as many businesses slashed their budgets for advertising, the company's primary source of income. Then, the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 sent Alphabet's stock tumbling further, with the AI chatbot posing a threat to Google's majority market share in search engines.  However, the company appears to be back on a growth path. In March, inflation eased for the ninth month in a row, hitting its lowest level since May 2021. Inflation rose 5% last month, down from 6% in February and a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. The news is positive for many tech stocks, including Alphabet. As inflation eases, businesses will be keener to utilize the company's digital advertising services, offering steady revenue growth.   Moreover, Alphabet has responded to the release of ChatGPT and its integration into **Microsoft**'s search engine Bing by pivoting its own business toward AI development. The move has given Alphabet something it has needed for years -- a clear and definitive direction. With little effort, the company has held an over 80% market share in search engines for decades. However, increased competition has lit a fire under Alphabet to retain that market share and develop its rival to ChatGPT, which it calls Bard.     https://preview.redd.it/4ns4g49x9eua1.png?width=875&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a84e7f1f3e216f804bb4a39d53e5962879385519  The launch of Bard in February was discouraging, with the chatbot sharing inaccurate information at its debut and failing to instill confidence in investors. But Alphabet's dominant influence in search grants it some time to improve its own tech and Google remains a formidable opponent -- even for Microsoft's Bing. Over the long term, I wouldn't bet against the Google company taking the lead in generative AI search engines.  Like Amazon, many experts are bullish about Alphabet's stock, with 47 out of 52 analysts rating it a strong buy or buy.  As the home of potent brands such as Android, YouTube, and the many services under Google, Alphabet is a leading tech company with attractive long-term prospects. With a 12-month price target of $125, which is 14% higher than its current position, Alphabet's stock is a must-buy this year.,;,; 2023-04-17 07:16:43]

[Tesla ($TSLA) stock and six other tech titans are responsible for 86% of the S&amp;P 500 2023 performance.,;,;    Tesla($TSLA) stock **plunged nearly 10% last week on earnings**. That caught everyone's attention, but it was just the tip of the iceberg.  0 seconds of 14 secondsVolume 0%   With roughly one-third of the S&amp;P 500 companies **announcing quarterly earnings results this week**, there are none bigger than tech titans **Alphabet** ($**GOOGL**), **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**) and **Meta Platforms** ($META). These four Big Tech stocks alone account for 41% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 year-to-date gain, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.  Adding **Apple** ($**AAPL**), which reports next week, **Nvidia** ($**NVDA**) and **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) stock, Colas says these seven tech giants account for 86% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 gain, which was 7.7% through Monday's close. These seven Big Tech stocks have rallied far more than the S&amp;P 500 this year.  According to Colas, there have been three drivers of outperformance for these tech leaders. First, all seven were deeply oversold at the end of 2022 and received a "January Effect" bounce.  The January Effect is a seasonal increase in stock prices throughout the month of January. The increase in demand for stocks in January is often preceded by a decrease in prices during the month of December, in part due to tax-loss harvesting.     Second, many of these tech companies have been aggressively cutting costs, so earnings power should now be higher than last year. And, finally, interest rates have declined, supporting the valuation of high-multiple stocks, he added.  ## Alphabet, Microsoft Earnings Due  Google-owner Alphabet reports earnings after the closing bell Tuesday. Shares are just below a 106.69 buy point in a **cup with handle**, according to **IBD MarketSmith** chart analysis.  Alphabet earnings are expected to measure $1.08 a share on revenue of $68.8 billion.  Dow Jones software giant Microsoft slid almost 2% midday Tuesday, threatening to extend a losing streak to four sessions ahead of the company's earnings results late Tuesday. MSFT stock is rolling back toward a 276.86 buy point in a **flat base** following a March 17 breakout.  Wall Street expects Microsoft to earn $2.24 a share on revenue of $51.0 billion, per FactSet estimates.     ## Amazon, Meta Earnings Also On Deck  E-commerce giant Amazon continues to trace the right side of a **cup base**, but is seeing resistance around its long-term 200-day moving average.  With earnings due out late Thursday, Amazon is expected to earn 21 cents a share on sales of $124.5 billion.  Facebook parent Meta Platforms will report Wednesday after the stock market closes. Meta stock is out of buy range past a **197.26 buy point** in a flat base, but receding.  The social media giant is expected to earn $2.02 a share on revenue of $27.6 billion.  ## Apple Earnings Next Week  Apple shares reversed squarely lower midday Tuesday. Still, they remain solidly above a 157.48 buy point and at the top of the **5% buy range** that runs up to 165.35.  The Dow Jones tech giant reports its fiscal second-quarter results on May 4. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to earn $1.43 a share on sales of $92.9 billion.     ## Nvidia Holds Up; Tesla Stock Breaks Down  Graphics-chip maker Nvidia remains near its recent highs despite sharp losses midday Tuesday. Shares declined more than 2% in afternoon trade.  The **IBD Leaderboard stock** broke out past a 230.59 handle buy point after the **company's strong earnings on Feb. 23**.  Electric-vehicle giant Tesla stock continues to trade near its lowest level since Jan. 26. In recent weeks, shares triggered the **7%-8% loss rule** from a buy point at 200.76 in a cup with handle.

[What Walmart‚Äôs ($WMT) stock split means for the Dow Jones.,;,; Walmart recently announced a 3 for 1 stock split, a significant move considering its status as a major component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Since the Dow is a price-weighted index, this split will decrease Walmart‚Äôs weighting in the index, initiating a rebalance to accommodate the drop in price.  It's intriguing to note that the Dow has been trailing behind the S&amp;P 500 in performance YTD, increasing ~2.6% and ~5.4% respectively.   Potentially prompting the index to consider adding new stocks to compensate for the YTD underperformance.  The last time the Dow underwent a significant change was in August 2020. At that time, Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell were added, while Exxon, Pfizer, and RTX Corp were removed.  Unlike their usual practices, the Dow committee has delayed making changes for an extended period of time, reminiscent of the period from June 2009 to September 2012.  With the Dow undergoing rebalancing, I‚Äôm eyeing potential exits for IBM, Cisco, Intel, Verizon, and Walgreens Boots Alliance.

[The stock market boom fueled by artificial intelligence has increased the wealth of the world's richest man by more than $150 billion. Gates himself has increased his wealth by $24 billion this year thanks to his holdings in Microsoft stock!,;,; Artificial intelligence has been one of the decisive themes in the stock market in 2023, and it has also helped the rich become richer. People's interest in intelligent language tool ChatGPT has quickly spread throughout the market, with prominent investors rushing to buy stocks of companies they believe can drive the rise of artificial intelligence.  Bill Gates has stated that AI could bring about a radical reshuffling in the tech industry, potentially threatening Google's market dominance, while Microsoft is making swift moves in the AI field. He expects that eventually, tech giants will integrate into applications similar to personal assistants, communicating with people and providing recommendations, replacing applications like Amazon, Siri, or Outlook. However, he points out that more work needs to be done to make AI tools like ChatGPT more accurate and objective.  In his past investments, Bill Gates has tended to invest in stable industries such as technology, healthcare, and energy. He has a deep insight into emerging technologies and future trends and invests in these areas. He emphasizes the importance of holding stocks for the long term and leans towards companies that have long-term growth potential. He believes that excellent companies can consistently create value over the long term.      How do you perceive stocks related to artificial intelligence? ,;,; 2023-07-17 07:42:21]

Here are their current recommendations:  **Vonovia**: German real estate company that specializes in residential property management and development.

[Everything you need to know about GME's earnings today,;,; GameStop will be reporting earnings from the most recent quarter today, we're expecting a loss of $0.14 per share.  We all know what happened in 2021 with the short squeeze. In fact, there's a new movie called Dumb Money that's all about it. But this post isn't about that. It's about today's earnings and whether or not calls (or puts) are a good idea. The company has been losing money for years and needs a bullish catalyst to help it turnaround.  **Key Factors**  [GameStop in June fired its chief executive](https://fortune.com/2023/06/07/gamestop-fires-ceo-names-ryan-cohen-executive-chairman/), Matthew Furlong, an Amazon veteran who had been appointed [two years earlier](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-names-amazon-executives-as-its-new-ceo-cfo-11623270149?mod=article_inline&amp;mod=article_inline). The company in June also said its board had elected activist investor Ryan Cohen, the co-founder of online pet-supplies retailer Chewy, as executive chair.  The [press release](https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-election-ryan-cohen-executive-chairman) announcing that move offered little detail. But GameStop, in a filing, said Cohen‚Äôs leadership would ‚Äúfurther unlock long-term value creation for our stockholders.‚Äù The company said it appointed Mark Robinson as general manager and principal executive officer.  In July, GameStop said Chief Financial Officer Diana Saadeh-Jajeh would [resign on Aug. 11.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-says-its-cfo-is-resigning-b00cc9c1?mod=mw_quote_news&amp;mod=article_inline) Daniel Moore, it said then, would become interim principal financial officer.  Cohen‚Äôs influence over GameStop has grown since 2020. Under his guidance, the company [last year put a bigger focus on physical stores](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-stores-ryan-cohen-f67d3871) after stumbles in its e-commerce push.  ‚ÄúThe videogame industry grew in [the second quarter], but a continuing digital mix shift likely impacted GameStop traffic,‚Äù [Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter](https://www.wedbush.com/analysts/michael-pachter/) said in a research note not too long ago. Pachter, in this note, said that growth in hardware, or things like consoles, for companies like Nintendo and Sony, as well as a ‚Äúcompelling‚Äù lineup for new games and other software, indicated potential good news for GameStop‚Äôs results during the second quarter. But he pointed to ‚Äúunderwhelming‚Äù hardware sales from Microsoft and said GameStop ‚Äúappears to have lost market share in recent quarters,‚Äù adding that its collectibles business ‚Äî which includes items like toys and trading cards ‚Äî faces difficult comparisons. He also noted the threat from a broader migration toward digital, mobile and subscription gaming.  ‚ÄúThere were notable new game releases such as Activision‚Äôs *Diablo IV* and Nintendo‚Äôs *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom*, with the majority of sales likely occurring digitally,‚Äù Pachter said.  In Gamestop's [2022 annual report](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/fe325562-c087-4fad-809c-efd183364196), the company highlighted a plan to cut costs (especially in Europe), improve vendor relationships and penetrate higher margin markets like collectibles and toys.  Just as important as earnings is guidance, however the company has not provided this metric in recent quarters. Still, from my research I see that analysts believe that the company will report third-quarter revenue of $1.159 million ‚Äî implying a YOY decline of 2.34% ‚Äî and an adjusted EPS loss of 14 cents. For the full year of 2023, analysts expect $5.706 billion of revenue and an adjusted EPS loss of 26 cents.  This does suck for GME, unfortunately it's not looking very good for share holders. However, the popularity in DRS shares is rising. Retail shareholders have enthusiastically adopted the practice of using the Direct Registration System (DRS). For those who don't know, the DRS allows investors to hold their shares through the company's transfer agent, Computershare. It eliminates the need to entrust shares to a broker or to possess a physical stock certificate, as was customary in the past.  By contrast, when individuals allow brokers to hold their shares, they're kept under the brokerage's "street name," rather than the investor's name. Brokers may then loan these shares to short sellers, who require access to the stock of the companies they are betting against.  GameStop's DRS numbers are growing, last earning report, [they revealed that](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/gme/gamestop-stock-76-6-million-shares-registered-holders-with-gmes-transfer-agent) 76.6 million shares were held by registered owners through Computershare. This indicates that around 25% of GameStop's outstanding shares were in the transfer agent's custody as of June 1. It also represents an increase of approximately 600,000 shares from the previous quarter. GameStop is likely among the companies with the most outstanding shares registered with its transfer agent. Since October 2021, GameStop's management has considered this information "material" and has included it in the company's quarterly filings. However, this isn't indicative of a positive or negative earning report today. It just shows the "ape" mentality regarding GME.   For those who like to trade options, I'm going to get puts on GME. However, those who are holding shares, it's best to sell today before close. This is *not* financial advice tho.,;,; 2023-09-06 18:47:11]
[Interested in how you found your strategy,;,; Hey everyone, I'm thrilled to be in a position where I can invest $4k monthly at the age of 19. However, with this exciting opportunity comes the challenge of deciding where to allocate my funds and which investment strategy to pursue. Currently, l've evenly split my investments between an investment account and a high-yield savings account, both of which have grown to close to $20k. However, I can't help but feel that I might be missing out on potential returns by keeping too much in the high yield savings account and lacking a clear investment strategy for stocks. When I first started investing at 18, I focused on stocks that seemed promising and affordable. However, i've come to realize that this may not be the most effective strategy. Now that I'm taking investing Investing more seriously, I'm eager to explore new strategies. Recently, l've been experimenting with purchasing VOO, but aside from that, I'm feeling a bit lost on where to go next.

Google stock is close to a buy point while Facebook parent Meta is pulling back after a massive run.  By themselves, they have a big impact on the major indexes.

[The Buffett Indicator Model signals an overvalued stock market. Worrisome?,;,; The Buffett Indicator (aka, Buffett Index, or Buffett Ratio) is the ratio of the total United States stock market to GDP. As of July 31, 2023 the ratio is calculated as:  *Aggregate US Market Value: $48.97T*   *divided by*  *Annualized GDP: $26.91T*  ***= 182%***  The current ratio of 182% is approximately 51.35% (or about 1.7 standard deviations) above the historical trend line, suggesting that the stock market is Overvalued relative to GDP.  The last times the ratio was like this were in September 2000, August 2020 and April 2022. The question is whether the Buffett Indicator should really be seen as a warning signal or not, given the fact that the modern economy has seen a rise in technology companies and businesses with significant intangible assets, such as patents and intellectual property and these assets may not be adequately represented in the GDP, potentially skewing the results of the Buffett Indicator.

[What company would you invest in if it was public or if it wasn't owned by company you can't trust?,;,; For me it would be no doubt Riot Games.   They make games in many different genres.

Making popular games such as Valorant, Team Fight Tactics. Even diving in the mobile gaming space creating the popular Wild Rift. Every game they produce seems to be made of gold. They are working on many other projects even making their own series on Netflix which is currently rated a 9 by 220k people. Now to the sad part. This company is owned by Tencent.

[Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY?,;,; A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings:  https://preview.redd.it/evtbd2dnkgec1.png?width=654&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47c5c6d9f58e6997aad5330dba32ff543e2c8541  Data Sources:  * SPY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/spy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Schwab](https://www.schwab.wallst.com/schwab/Prospect/research/etfs/schwabETF/index.asp?type=holdings&amp;symbol=SPY)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/?guccounter=1)‚Äã‚Äã. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST)‚Äã * SFY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/sfy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Zacks.com](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SFY/holding)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SFY/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST)  **Key Observations:**  * Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. * Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. * Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.  It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.  I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:  1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. 2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&amp;P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. 3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. 4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. 5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. 6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.  It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.  **What are your thoughts?**,;,; 2024-01-24 21:46:21]

He's 25, and it's more of a buy weekly/bi-weekly and come back in 3 - 5 years.  Picks:  * VOO - Tracks the performance of the 500 biggest US companies. * VUG - Tracks U.S. large-cap growth companies. It provides investors with diversified exposure to stocks of companies that are expected to have higher-than-average growth rates. * AAPL - Apple  * TD - Always good to have at least one bank for diversification * AMZN - Amazon  I know VOO and VUG overlap, especially with AAPL and AMZN, but I want him to have 2 primary ETFs and 3 to 4 stocks. I was thinking of adding SHOP too. I did take out NVDA and TSLA.,;,; 2023-06-28 20:19:33]

[Shopify ($SHOP) delivers impressive earnings, enticing investors to consider buying the stock.,;,;    ## Shopify's Q1 earnings call contained a major surprise.  The e-commerce landscape is dominated by behemoths like **Amazon** and **Walmart**. However, there are a number of rising players that have made inroads. One of them is **Shopify** **(****SHOP** **0.15%)**. If you have ever clicked on an advertisement on Facebook or Instagram and subsequently made a purchase, chances are you've checked out using Shopify.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, Shopify boomed in popularity. It's no secret that the pandemic was a catalyst for online shopping and the creation of side hustles (monetizing a hobby). During this period, Shopify's offering was in high demand, and subsequently, the financial profile of the company seemingly changed overnight.  It should be noted that Shopify's infrastructure is designed for businesses of all sizes, and not just small or medium businesses (SMBs). For example, Tesla uses Shopify as does PepsiCo, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and Nestle.  Furthermore, large consulting firms like Deloitte and enterprises such as **IBM** have strategic agreements with the e-commerce company as systems-integrated partners.  Like many other businesses, Shopify's operating results have started to normalize in a post-pandemic world and shares are up roughly 70% this year as of the time of this article, although they still are down about 65% from all-time highs in November 2021. Let's dig into the company's first-quarter results and assess if it's trading at a reasonable valuation and deserves a look for your portfolio.     ## Shopify's Q1 at a Glance  During Shopify's fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call, management offered the following outlook for the first quarter of 2023:  * Revenue growth in the high-teen percentages year over year; * Gross margins to be slightly higher quarter over quarter.  Per the company's Q1 earnings release, Shopify's revenue grew by 25% (and 27% on a constant-currency basis) to $1.5 billion. And its gross margin was 47.5%, up from 46% in Q4.So it's safe to say that Shopify exceeded its own forecast.  Another metric to analyse is the company's operating expenses. For the quarter, Shopify's operating expenses totalled $910 million, up 24% year over year. That increase was mainly driven by salaries and wages, including those of the company's Deliver employees, a business that Shopify is now selling just a year after buying it.  While Shopify blew away its revenue forecast, investors should be keenly aware that the company's combined annual growth for the cost of goods sold and operating expenses outweighed its revenue growth. For this reason, Shopify reported an operating loss of $193 million, nearly double its operating loss in Q1 2022. Yet despite these operating losses, Shopify reported a net income of $68 million, or $0.05 in earnings per share (EPS).¬†   By contrast, Shopify reported a net loss of $1.5 billion ($1.17 EPS) for Q1 2022. This was due to a $1.6 billion net unrealized loss on equity and other investments.  Shopify owns stakes in other companies, and when these stocks experience volatility in either direction, it must factor those unrealized gains or losses relative to the cost basis for each investment into its bottom line. It should be noted that in Q1 2023, Shopify booked a net unrealized gain of $269 million, more than enough to overcome the operating loss. ¬†  Overall, these financial results look like a mixed bag to me. I am quite impressed by the revenue growth. However, Q1 clearly illustrated that the Deliver integration, and its associated costs, were a drag on the core business. After a year of rising costs and slow integration efforts, it's no wonder Shopify decided to pull the plug and divest these logistics assets to Flex port. While Shopify is also undergoing cost reductions in the form of layoffs, I question if a consistent path to profitability is viable.     ## Didn't see this coming  Although Shopify beat Wall Street's expectations, I think the *real* cause of its post-earnings stock surge was the surprise announcement that the company is selling its logistics assets to Flexport, a leader in that niche.  Remember, it was only last May that Shopify acquired the logistics and fulfillment company Deliverr. The thesis behind the deal was to layer Deliverr's merchant solutions on top of Shopify's fulfillment network (SFN) infrastructure. But over the last year, management has been updating investors about its integration efforts. Namely, Shopify's management made it clear that the extra costs associated with building out SFN will have a *dilutive* impact on the company's margin profile.¬†  While it may be uncomfortable to admit, Shopify's Q1 results show that it has overhead bloat, driven mainly by added headcount from Deliverr. The divestiture helps Shopify cut labor other non-core operating expenses related to its logistics business.¬†     ## Is the stock a buy?  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ejok5t214q0b1.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=07eb3d2aa3cc50571a3de7cb8c4eb82190d7c22e     In my opinion, there is more than meets the eye here. When it comes to logistics, Amazon is a juggernaut and it took decades to get there. Plain and simple, Shopify does not have the financial flexibility or the technical know-how to compete. On the surface, selling the logistics assets seems like a smart and responsible move for Shopify.¬†  After the earnings call, analysts at several Wall Street institutions, among them **Goldman Sachs**, **Citigroup**, **Morgan Stanley**, and Piper Sandler, revised their price targets for Shopify.  Citigroup is the most bullish with a price estimate of $65 per share, implying roughly 8% upside from a recent price of about $60. By contrast, Piper Sandler modeled an intrinsic value of $50 per share or 17% downside. Goldman and Morgan Stanley have price estimates of $59 and $54 per share, respectively. The common theme among the banks is that all have neutral or neutral-equivalent ratings.  Shopify is not yet consistently profitable, which makes traditional valuation metrics such as price-to-earnings or the price/earnings-to-growth ratio less useful. One metric that can help is price-to-sales (P/S). Shopify is currently trading at 13 times its trailing-12-month revenue. P/S ratios vary by industry. But a general rule of thumb is to compare P/S ratios among competitors in the same industry. Given that comparable companies such as Amazon and Walmart are much larger, mature businesses, it's not necessarily fair to judge Shopify's P/S ratio because it's still a growth company, which as a group tends to have high ratios.¬†¬†  I personally do not like stocks when momentum is pushing them up. As a long-term investor, I am not looking to buy on perceived good news and sell on an upswing to book a quick gain. The most prudent action for investors is likely to assess Q2 earnings and digest how the Flexport deal is going. While Shopify has built a credible operation, the company faces an uphill battle, particularly with Amazon. There is definitely money to be made in Shopify stock, but it's volatility and underlying business fundamentals are enough for me to look elsewhere, and based on the available metrics it doesn't seem to be trading at a reasonable level.,;,; 2023-05-19 05:36:43]

[What has made stock markets in the last 2 decades to be less fundamentally focused?,;,; So I‚Äôm 21, and it seems like the entire duration of my life, stock markets have ceased to be driven by fundamentals, and it seems to be driven by momentum, FOMO and occasionally straight fear. The market now seems to be filled with periods of irrational exuberance and steep downturns with little inbetween. Why? There is little time where buyers and sellers are in check and an efficient consensus has been reached on how much an asset should be priced.  It seemed back when investing and markets in general were logical, growth was maybe number 4 on the totem pole of impotence for an investor to consider. Growth is obviously important but these days it‚Äôs the *only* thing that‚Äôs important. Why?  What exactly changed to make the stock market a slower cycle, with lower highs and lower lows, to an extremely volatile, non fundamental driven machine? Bubbles have been around since the 17th century or earlier, but what event, explicitly has made them more common, when you‚Äôd expect the number of asset bubbles to decrease quadratically upon one‚Äôs lifetime?  Is it just that market participants are not humans anymore(99.9% of them)? Robots don‚Äôt care about fundamentals and they just want to squeeze every penny out of something? Technology? Artificially low interest rates? I just want to know what exactly caused this change in markets. If it‚Äôs just computers, why does Bloomberg and CNBC say ‚Äúinvestors don‚Äôt care about X stock market soars‚Äù instead of ‚Äúalgorithms don‚Äôt care‚Ä¶‚Äù? It implies normal people are the ones seriously engaging in asset inflation.  I understand that the market is in a Peroid of irrational exuberance, just like how in 2020 it was in a Peroid of unbound fear, unfortunately I turned 18 after the market already reached new highs.  Thank you for whatever answers you may provide, I understand this is a nuanced issue.  To me, and I‚Äôm not majoring in anything related to this, it seems with the technology it should be easy to value these things in a way that‚Äôs fair to both buyers and sellers. At the end of the day these are just stocks, not your first born they‚Äôre not invaluable. It‚Äôs a little confusing I guess to someone studying to be a structural engineer.,;,; 2023-06-15 19:43:06]

[Apple becomes first U.S. company to reach $3 trillion market cap,;,;    * **Apple hit a market cap of $3 trillion briefly during trading on Monday.** * **The milestone is mostly symbolic but it represents investor recognition of Apple‚Äôs success over the past few years as the company has reported several record-breaking quarters of big growth in all of its product lines.** * **Apple‚Äôs cash flow also makes the stock a safe haven during times of market uncertainty.**  Apple briefly hit a market cap of $3 trillion during intraday trading on Monday, before dropping back under the mark shortly afterwards. Apple broke the barrier when its share price hit $182.86.  Apple rose 2.5% on Monday to close at $182.01, just missing closing the trading day at the $3 trillion mark.   The milestone is mostly symbolic but it shows investors remain bullish on Apple stock and its ability to grow. At a market value of $3 trillion, Apple tripled its valuation in under four years. And analysts see plenty of room to run.  Apple showed annual growth across all of its product categories in its fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue up 29% year-over-year. While the iPhone is still the biggest sales driver, Apple‚Äôs services business grew 25.6% year-over-year and delivered more than $18 billion in revenue during the quarter.   In December, for example, Morgan Stanley‚Äôs Katy Huberty raised the firm‚Äôs price target on Apple from $164 to $200, and maintained the equivalent of a buy rating, arguing that new products like virtual reality and augmented reality headsets aren‚Äôt yet baked into the share price.  Huberty also said she expects Apple‚Äôs App Store revenue to outperform Morgan Stanley‚Äôs forecasts for the quarter and for Apple to ship 83 million units during the December quarter, 3 million more than anticipated.  Apple sold 27 million pairs of its newest AirPods model over the holidays, driving 20% year-over-year growth for Apple‚Äôs wearables business during the quarter, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TFI Asset Management Limited said in a Monday note.  Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote on Sunday that the mark is a ‚Äúwatershed moment‚Äù but has more room to grow, especially since Ives values Apple‚Äôs services business at $1.5 trillion.  Investors also turned to Apple as a safe haven during recent market uncertainty, thanks to its strong balance sheet and prodigious cash flow, which it uses to invest in new products, stock buybacks and to return capital to shareholders through dividends.  Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to hit a $1 trillion market cap during intraday trading on Aug. 2, 2018. It hit a $2 trillion valuation just over two years later on Aug. 19, 2020.  Apple‚Äôs peers aren‚Äôt far behind. Microsoft is worth about $2.5 trillion, Amazon has about a $1.75 market cap and Google‚Äôs market valuation is just shy of $2 trillion.  Apple stock rose 34% in 2021.,;,; 2023-06-14 09:30:13]

[Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&amp;P 500 gains,;,; = just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing =  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023  [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9)  &amp;#x200B;  The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&amp;P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.  &amp;#x200B;  It‚Äôs an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inflation battle, noted FactSet‚Äôs Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 top performing days for the S&amp;P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday‚Äôs close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%.  &amp;#x200B;  Through Dec. 22, the S&amp;P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&amp;P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.  &amp;#x200B;  Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&amp;P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  That didn‚Äôt mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.  &amp;#x200B;  Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.  &amp;#x200B;  Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.  &amp;#x200B;  The strategy ‚Äúindicates the Fed‚Äôs measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,‚Äù Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&amp;P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks‚Äô bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group‚Äôs announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.  &amp;#x200B;  SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a ‚Äúmini‚Äù banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.  &amp;#x200B;  Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks ‚Äî Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%,  and Meta Platforms Inc.  META, 0.56%.  &amp;#x200B;  See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?  &amp;#x200B;  Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high:  &amp;#x200B;  The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs overall return, he wrote, with the company‚Äôs success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.,;,; 2023-12-27 15:52:27]
[IonQ Pursues a Revolutionary Step in AI: Striving to Develop Quantum Machine Learning Models Matching Human Cognitive Abilities,;,; IonQ, a quantum computing company, is aiming to pioneer Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models that can rival the capabilities of human intelligence. The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.  &amp;#x200B;  In terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities. Their next major technical milestone is achieving 35 algorithmic qubits (AQ) which, beyond this point, will make it more cost-effective to run models on actual quantum machines than simulating them classically. IonQ also collaborates with leading tech companies like Amazon, Dell, Microsoft, and NVIDIA to integrate their quantum technology with the partners' AI and machine learning expertise.  &amp;#x200B;  Further, IonQ is venturing into Quantum Artificial Intelligence and has already published research on modeling human cognition. This field of study employs quantum computers to simulate human cognition, potentially offering powerful insights into artificial general intelligence (AGI).,;,; 2023-06-03 08:24:05]

[Is there any subscription that you find to be worth paying for?,;,; I am not looking for stock picks or anything like that. Rather, I am interested in well written analysis on different stocks that I might not be aware of (kind of like DD) or general useful data (flow data, unusual options flow data, etc). I have done a few 7 day free trials and they were actually decent and somewhat informative. The price was a bit high for the trials that I tried out so I cancelled but I think it can be worth it sometimes if the analysis is well researched or it brings something to my attention - maybe a new drug is going to release results soon for a disease for example but its not really known but has a big market.

[Total noob looking for a little help,;,; Hey all  So as the title states I'm a total newb to trading in general really. I do feel I have an alright understanding of how to evaluate a stock to some degree of success. However I'm having trouble using that evaluation to accurately predict how a stock is going to react. Obviously there is no exact science to this stuff but I just need to be a little more consistent.   So looking at two stocks this morning during pre-market. AMZN and DKNG, both beat fairly well on earnings. My initial thought process was okay both beat on earnings and both have gapped up a fair amount during extended hours trading, I would think they would continue the breakout maybe after a slight pullback at the open. However AMZN consolidated and eventually it gradually climbs to 143.63 then again gradually sells off throughout the day. Okay makes sense. DKNG however just dumps right off the open and continues to fall throughout the day quite sharply with a couple slight pullbacks, it falls all the way to about 30.38.  So I Googled around a bit trying to figure out why a stock that just posted good earnings would drop off like that. Most common answer I seemed to find was it's more about forward guidance than the actual current earnings. Okay that makes sense. So I went back and looked at both companies guidance for earnings next quarter on TradingView. Both are projected to post worse earnings next quarter than they just posted.   So based on that I would think both of them should take a bit of a dive no? This is where I'm confused. Why would they behave so differently? I'm still very much learning the "market psychology" so to speak and maybe that is where I'm going wrong? Genuinely trying to and interested in learning so any insight or advice anyone can offer would be much appreciated.  As a side note if there are any learning resources you found really helped you when starting out would you mind sharing? :)  Thanks in advance!,;,; 2023-08-05 01:19:49]
[Stock-picking dog beats AI in sniffing out winners,;,; "Artificial intelligence programmes are now capable of seducing lonely humans, writing Hollywood dialogue and even turning out passable imitations of Oasis songs.  One thing they cannot yet do, however, is pick a stock portfolio with any more success than a rescue dog can, if an experiment in Germany is anything to go by.  Freddy, an eight-year-old Maltese cross who selected shares by gravitating towards treats laid out on slips of paper, trounced a set of recommendations from ChatGPT, achieving nearly four times the returns delivered by the AI over the course of six weeks.  Since the mid-19th century financial theorists have debated whether skill and knowledge are really any better guide than the vagaries of chance when placing bets on the markets. In various tests schoolchildren, animals and darts carelessly flung at a wall have outperformed human experts.  In the 2000s the Chicago Sun-Times hired as its star investment columnist a capuchin monkey called Adam Monk, who chose stocks by circling items in the business pages with a red felt-tip pen. More often than not he beat leading financial analysts.  This time, however, the German magazine WirtschaftsWoche pitted Freddy against an AI in one of the first contests of its kind, with each given a notional war chest of ‚Ç¨19,000 to spend on shares in 15 companies.  While ChatGPT is not set up to issue specific investment suggestions, it volunteered to assemble a ‚Äúdiversified portfolio of stocks [in firms] that demonstrate solid accounts, have growing sales, remain profitable and have a high market capitalisation‚Äù.   Its relatively conservative picks, ranging from dominant tech corporations such as Apple and Amazon to well-known consumer-focused businesses such as McDonald‚Äôs and CocaCola, yielded a respectable but unspectacular 3.5 per cent.  Freddy, on the other hand, perhaps inured to the cut-throat caprices of life by his youth as a stray dog on the streets of Istanbul, bet heavily on energy, AI and technological hardware. While this Warren Wooffett‚Äôs forays into bitcoin and oil went a little sour, punts on Nvidia, a high-end chipmaker, and Uniper, a troubled German energy conglomerate, paid off handsomely.  His total return of 13.5 per cent outclassed not only the AI but also the majority of normal investment funds.  ‚ÄúHe did a great job,‚Äù Ali Masarwah, director of the Envestor fund platform, told the magazine. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather trust Freddy than the AI with my money.‚Äù,;,; 2023-07-11 08:00:21]

[The Rise of Data Centers: An Alternative to NVDA‚Äôs Dominance in the AI Market.,;,; Wall Street Awakens to New Opportunities Amidst Overvaluation Concerns and NVDA‚Äôs Vulnerabilities  In recent times, the technology landscape has been dominated by the impressive growth and innovation of companies like Nvidia (NVDA), which have become synonymous with artificial intelligence (AI) advancements. However, a new contender has emerged, challenging the notion that NVDA is the sole option for investors seeking exposure to the AI market. Data centers, once considered a supporting player, are now positioning themselves as formidable alternatives with the potential to not only rival but surpass the computing power of NVDA. This article explores the rise of data centers and the vulnerabilities of NVDA, shedding light on the implications they pose for investors amidst concerns of NVDA‚Äôs overvaluation on Wall Street.  The Alternative Powerhouses: Data centers have traditionally served as the backbone of cloud computing, storing vast amounts of information and providing processing capabilities to various industries. However, with the exponential growth of AI applications, data centers have evolved into powerhouses capable of supporting complex computational tasks and training neural networks. Unlike NVDA, which primarily focuses on semiconductors, data centers possess the infrastructure, scalability, and dedicated resources required to handle the intensive computing demands of AI algorithms. They are now ready to challenge NVDA‚Äôs dominance in terms of computing power and offer a more diverse investment opportunity in the semiconductor market.  Overvaluation Concerns and Market Perception: The buzz surrounding NVDA‚Äôs achievements has led to concerns of overvaluation as investors rush to invest in what was once considered the primary AI play. The stock‚Äôs valuation has skyrocketed, raising questions about its sustainability. However, market perceptions are shifting, driven by the emergence of data centers as a compelling alternative. Savvy investors are recognizing the potential benefits of diversifying their portfolios and exploring opportunities beyond NVDA, which could protect them from the risks associated with an overvalued stock.  The Shift in Market Dynamics: The financial landscape is dynamic and ever-evolving, with market sentiment and trends constantly shifting. The growing recognition of data centers as a powerful alternative to NVDA signals a potential turning point in the AI market. As the market becomes saturated with NVDA investments, the demand for alternative investment opportunities is expected to surge.  Blackstone‚Äôs Strategic Focus: Notably, Blackstone, a prominent player in the investment landscape, has already made a decisive move in favor of data centers. Recognizing the changing and highly competitive nature of the semiconductor sector, Blackstone has chosen to prioritize investments in data centers. This strategic shift underscores their confidence and foresight, as they find valuations more favorable and growth more prominent in the data center market.  Investing in Data Centers: A Viable Strategy? Given the increasing competitiveness of data centers, investors seeking exposure to the AI market may find it wise to explore this emerging sector. Data centers provide a robust and diversified approach, offering access to a range of companies harnessing AI capabilities. By investing in data centers, individuals can capitalize on the growing demand for AI-driven computing power while mitigating the risks associated with NVDA‚Äôs vulnerabilities and potential overvaluation.  Conclusion: The dominance of NVDA in the AI market is no longer assured, as data centers rise to prominence and challenge its position. While NVDA has undoubtedly been at the forefront of AI advancements, the emergence of data centers as a formidable alternative cannot be ignored. Investors are increasingly recognizing the value of diversifying their portfolios and exploring alternative opportunities beyond NVDA‚Äôs potential overvaluation. Wall Street is awakening to the vulnerabilities of NVDA and the immense potential of data centers, which are poised to reshape the investment landscape and provide a broader array of opportunities in the AI market. Blackstone‚Äôs strategic focus on data centers further solidifies their importance in the shifting technological landscape.,;,; 2023-07-17 15:59:44]

Conveniently, Microsoft released numbers as well this week so we can lump Azure into this. Amazon has not yet given us an update on AWS, but we should get that next week. For now, here's a breakdown of how the Cloud market stacks up.   [AWS vs Azure vs Google Cloud](https://preview.redd.it/ujdyz4xqakeb1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77900a753697eb52ba6a328f5a219b3a9a10b1d4)  It should be noted that Microsoft does not break Azure out from a whole lot of other tools, I've assumed it's around two-thirds of "Intelligent Cloud" today. It could easily be +/- $5B from that $58.9B figure, but there's no confirmation of that.   Over time, Google Cloud and Azure are closing the gap on AWS. It's worth noting that the size of the pie is growing considerably, so AWS is still growing at a good pace, just Azure and Google Cloud have been growing a lot better recently.   &amp;#x200B;  [AWS vs Google Cloud vs Azure over time](https://preview.redd.it/yqwy50b7bkeb1.png?width=1354&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5bf590948c039ac062ab41933ebb8a66bf8aa53a)  # YouTube vs Netflix  YouTube once again saw some decent advertising growth and it got me thinking... it's bigger than Netflix, right?

So, the next time Disney+ versus Max vs Netflix is brought up in a "King of Streaming" battle, just know that YouTube is sat quietly dominating in the background.   # Google Cloud's Profitable Year  Finally, Google Cloud is on track for a profitable year on an operating basis.

[Shopify Inc ($SHOP) stock has a big earnings release coming up. What should you expect?,;,; **Shopify** ($SHOP) stock has been one of the best-performing on the Toronto Stock Exchange since its initial public offering in 2015. Although the stock performed poorly over the last 12 months, losing 70% of its value at one point, it has, nevertheless, outperformed over its eight years as a public company.  The question at this point is, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù In a few short years, $SHOP went from a small startup to a major company doing over $4 billion per year in revenue. It has been a wild ride, and it‚Äôs only natural to wonder what‚Äôs next for Canada‚Äôs most successful new technology company.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/irs49j25gmua1.png?width=809&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f547b8d3ab78a249f02e1f80dd27e2594c093c56     ## Earnings coming up next month  The most obvious upcoming development for Shopify is its next earnings release. On May 4, Shopify will release its earnings for the first quarter of 2023 ‚Äî a release that will reveal important information like  * Revenue; * Profit; * Important operational information (e.g., new vendors); and * Guidance for the next quarter from Tobias L√ºtke and his executive team.  It will be a closely watched earnings release. Shopify‚Äôs previous release was mixed, showing revenue growing 26%, which was an improvement from the quarter before, but it also showed widening losses. Overall, it was not well received, and investors sold off $SHOP stock when it came out.  On the first day of trading after $SHOP release came out, the stock fell 16%, thanks to the earnings miss and weak guidance. In the weeks and months that followed, the stock gained back what it had lost and then some, thanks mainly do to improving sentiment toward tech stocks as a whole.  If Shopify‚Äôs next earnings release meet or exceeds estimates, then the company will have a chance to keep the momentum going.  ## What to expect  It‚Äôs never easy to predict what a company will achieve in a given quarter. However, we know that Shopify itself is expecting  * High-teens percentage revenue growth; * A slight improvement in gross margin (that is, gross profit divided by revenue); * Low single-digit growth in operating costs; * Capital expenditures continuing at last year‚Äôs level; and * Stock-based compensation continuing at last year‚Äôs level.  Given that $SHOP expects high-teens growth in sales combined with single-digit growth in expenses, we should expect the profit situation to improve. However, there are some factors that could complicate this.  For example, Shopify owns a portfolio of listed stocks. If they went down last quarter, they could cause $SHOP to swing back into negative earnings. Global-E Online, one stock that Shopify owns, has risen 32% this year, so is there is reason to think that it will help $SHOP earnings rather than harm them. Nevertheless, we can‚Äôt be 100% sure how the cookie will crumble.  ## Foolish takeaway  Having looked at the upcoming developments for Shopify, I think there is reason to believe the company will do well. It continues expecting strong growth, while also lowering its expense growth. It should do well as a business. The stock is another matter: it is rather expensive, trading at 10 times sales. That‚Äôs too high for a value investor like me, but other investors may have different experiences with $SHOP stock.,;,; 2023-04-18 10:51:15]
[Why US &amp; Global Market is suddenly green?,;,; Maybe don‚Äôt rejoice with more calls just yet.

Fed usually looks at Core Inflation but I believe market in general is thinking: you know what Fed can say with what‚Äôs happened at SVB, Signature, etc and fallout from that to be seen on CPI and Jobs report etc BS and overall inflation in the expected range we can take it slow for this month being prudent. Remember Fed likes to save not cause market events.   2) Market was baking in collapse of some more US regional banks and severe pressure on Credit Suisse (Swiss). Both fears have been allayed for time being. No bank run happened on Monday and none is probable today making market think the Fed and Treasury announcement has helped.   3) To those who would say why are we talking about US markets when thinking of Global Markets - well nothing changed Globally from Thursday last week yet we saw almost all Markets pricing in some major event. Any guesses ? SVB / Signature/ US market! Heck if anything markets other than US have been reporting positive events.   4) Where things would become interesting is as we approach 22 March. If Fed rate hike comes in at 50bps one part of the market will be fearful for more bank collapses in USA. If rate hike doesn‚Äôt come the Inflation camp is going to smell this as a threat to economic sustainability and merge that with ‚ÄúAll money is insured‚Äù rhetoric of US Govt creating a scenario with narrative being something like: More money printed - Insuring heavily discounted bonds to 100% is excess money printing in short term, inflation unchecked, Common Man affected, Consumption is going to take a toll in coming months, economy is going to be out of control of Fed, so all is doomed.  *Bonus: Where will the next red blip come from. Well could come from anywhere but I think with SVB and Signature getting out of play a lot of startups - starving for funding- will get the right of passage to raise a white flag. This will in my humble opinion cause a revenue shock for Commercial RE, Hosting Service Providers (think Shopify, AWS, Azure, Google, etc), and Digital/ SMM marketing services like Meta, Twitter, Snap, Google, Amazon, etc among other key big ticket vendors on startups list of expenses. *,;,; 2023-03-14 14:45:43]
[Nvidia Surpasses Berkshire By Market Value In the Decisive Moment of AI Era,;,; Just two days ago, Nvidia dropped a bomb on the AI industry, igniting an already-hot field. Meanwhile, the Fed just signaled the end of a rate-hiking cycle. Together, these factors propelled Nvidia's market value beyond that of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, cementing its position as the fifth-largest publicly traded company in the United States.  Overnight, Nvidia's stock rose 2.73% to $271.9, increasing its market value to $671.6 billion. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway's A-class shares fell 0.64%, decreasing its market value to $659.1 billion, allowing Nvidia to surpass it in market value.   Just five months ago, it would have been a laughing matter if someone had suggested that Nvidia would surpass Berkshire Hathaway in market value. However, market sentiment has changed, the rise of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence technologies has provided strong support for Nvidia. With the development of AI technology, the demand for computing power is increasing. Nvidia's one-stop-shop approach of providing both hardware and software ecosystem puts it in a leading position globally.  As a result, Nvidia's stock price has risen nearly 90% since the beginning of the year, and its increase is even higher at 136% if calculated from its low point in October last year. In comparison, Berkshire's stock price has fallen 3.4% and risen 13.4% during these two periods.  If the AI boom continues, it seems that there will be no stopping the rise in Nvidia's stock price. However, some experts point out that while Nvidia has excelled in the AI race, its high valuation could be a concern. Currently, its expected P/E ratio is over 60, a level it has only reached once in the past 10 years. This has left analysts who are both bullish on Nvidia's prospects and well-versed in the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market in a bit of a bind.  Analysts believe that Nvidia's business related to AIGC is almost entirely dependent on capital expenditures from global tech giants, especially Microsoft and Google. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri predicted in a report last week that AIGC could bring an additional $10-15 billion in GPU demand over the next one to two years.  Based on this, analysts currently predict that Nvidia's annual revenue will exceed $46 billion in three years, with an average annual growth rate of 20% - an astonishing rate for a chip manufacturer of Nvidia's size. However, tech giants' capital expenditures in the data center space are not evenly distributed, as evidenced by disappointing results in cloud services from companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google in their earnings reports for the quarter ended December last year, with warnings that growth rates will further slow down in the current quarter.  In addition, Nvidia may face increasingly fierce competition from AMD, which is launching its own data center GPU chips.  Last week, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore upgraded Nvidia's rating to a buy, even though he also pointed out that its valuation had risen to extremely high levels. He said that the development of AIGC is too big of a trend to be disrupted by tactical concerns; while it may be difficult to bet on Nvidia's stock at its current level, shorting the company also seems unwise.

[What to watch for Netflix Stock before Q1 2023 Earnings,;,; Netflix ($NFLX) is scheduled to report its Q1 2023 earnings on April 18, 2023. Here are some things to watch for in the earnings report:  * Subscriber growth:¬†Netflix is facing increasing competition from other streaming services, such as Disney+ and HBO Max. As a result, subscriber growth is expected to slow in Q1 2023. * Revenue:¬†Revenue is expected to grow in Q1 2023, but at a slower pace than in previous quarters. * Earnings per share:¬†Earnings per share are expected to grow in Q1 2023, but at a slower pace than revenue. * Content spending:¬†Netflix is spending more money on original content, which is driving up costs. Investors will be looking for signs that the company is able to generate enough revenue from its content to offset these costs. * International expansion:¬†Netflix is expanding its international business, but it is facing challenges in some markets. Investors will be looking for updates on the company's international expansion plans.  *Processing img kxt65av0bpua1...*  Bears  1. Netflix is a global streaming service with over 220 million subscribers. It has been the dominant player in the streaming market for years, but it is facing increasing competition from other streaming services, such as Disney+, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime Video. The streaming market is becoming increasingly crowded, with new services launching all the time. This is making it more difficult for Netflix to stand out from the competition and attract new subscribers. This increased competition will likely lead to higher marketing and content costs, which will limit the company's ability to expand its margins. 2. Rising costs:¬†Netflix is spending more money on original content, marketing, and technology. These costs are increasing as the company grows and expands its operations. 3. Slowing subscriber growth:¬†Netflix's subscriber growth has been slowing in recent quarters. This is likely due to a number of factors, including increased competition and rising costs.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ksbqie23bpua1.png?width=2080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc71b6525f094c98652c2af760b0adb861624899  Bulls  1. Netflix's internal recommendation software and large subscriber base give the company a competitive advantage when it comes to acquiring content. The company's recommendation software is able to accurately predict what content its subscribers will enjoy, which allows Netflix to make more informed decisions about which content to acquire. Additionally, Netflix's large subscriber base gives the company more leverage in negotiations with content providers. 2. Netflix has built a substantial content library over the years, which gives the company a competitive advantage over its rivals. The company's content library includes a wide variety of popular TV shows, movies, and documentaries. This content library is constantly being updated with new content, which helps to keep subscribers engaged. 3. Netflix is also expanding internationally, which opens up new markets for the company to add subscribers. The company has already established a presence in over 190 countries, and it plans to continue expanding its international reach in the future.,;,; 2023-04-18 20:18:55]
[SP500 Futures TA for 8/2/23,;,;  *I share my plan for educational purposes and discussion and it is not intended as trade recommendations or ideas.*  ***Recap***: In the plan for today I wrote that *‚Äúa sustained breakout above* ***4609-20*** *would signal that a new trend leg is developing‚Äù*. This level was tested but not taken out overnight and so what looked like a potential breakout at yesterday‚Äôs close again failed and kept the market in a tight range.¬†  In said in the plan that I 'm viewing **4596** support. In the premarket session, the market tested below this level and recovered it, and I got long just after the market opened today. I exited the majority of the trade at **4609**, the next resistance level from the plan, and the last contract was taken out at breakeven. For as tight a range as the market is in, I‚Äôm happy to get a win at all. The market proceeded to retest **4596** and even towards the other support level from yesterday‚Äôs educational section, but really didn‚Äôt go anywhere.  ***Balance/Trend***: The market has been in the balance area since July 18; I have defined this region as **4559-4609**, and added an additional level at **4620** to capture the drift we‚Äôve seen at the highs when the market has tried breaking above 4609. Since Friday, this has tightened further and there is no predominant recent trend. Core trends, ones that span weeks or months or more, are all still pointing up.¬†  ***Analysis***: Today‚Äôs action was more of what we‚Äôve come to expect in balanced markets and indeed is the reason why I always track the balance and trend in the section above. In yesterday‚Äôs newsletter, I highlighted the fact that the market continues to balance within the upper distribution of the Friday profile and today‚Äôs low keeps that bit of analysis relevant.  In the near term, I would watch for bulls to hold the market above **4589** (and **4582** at the lowest) to keep their near-term momentum . A failure here raises the odds that the market moves back to the balance area lows at **4559**. Whatever happens though, it‚Äôs clearly a choppy consolidation until some sort of trend resumes (above **4609-20** or below **4559**). With jobs figures due the rest of this week and Apple and Amazon reporting on Thursday, volatility could/should be just ahead.¬†  ***Plan***  * There are several support levels that I‚Äôm watching that are bunched together, as they often are in these environments: **4573**, **4579-82, 4589, 4596**. These were all covered in greater detail elsewhere, but given their proximity and the choppy conditions, trading these could be very difficult. As usual, I am following my guidelines to get confirmation and exit the trade at the next level * One potential support that I‚Äôm watching is at **4562**, a spot where the market previously saw strong buying. Ideally the market would test **4559** first and bounce from there for me to get long at this level * If the market were to lose the balance area lows, I would be hesitant to trade counter to that trend, though a spot to watch for a support trade would be at **4542-45** * Other potential support levels are **4529**, **4494-97**, **4479, 4472**, **4466** * Again, the market would really need to clear **4620** to convince me of a breakout, and even then I rarely chase them. My preference would be a breakout and retest, perhaps down to about **4616**,¬† to signal a long * There is potential resistance at **4636**, where I added a second aqua trendline to better reflect recent market action. The core level from that channel is at \~**4662** * The next spot for resistance is **4683** and comes from the yellow trend channel, which I recently added to connect the October ‚Äò22 and March ‚Äò23 lows  https://preview.redd.it/o7ver5pi3kfb1.png?width=1714&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ffe4133de72f78b6181ecb263e788b9e8feb3131,;,; 2023-08-01 20:12:42]
[Shopify Stock: Bear vs. Bull,;,;    * **Shopify was the right business at the right time during the pandemic.** * **The post-lockdown period has seen Shopify's business come under tremendous pressure.** * **Shopify returned to its money-losing ways this year, and forecasts more losses in the future.**   **Can this one-time market darling earn its way back into the good graces of investors?**  **Shopify** **(****SHOP** **-2.90%)** rallied hard during the pandemic as people forced out of work by stay-at-home rules raced to the internet to launch online businesses. Revenue more than tripled during the three-year period between 2019 and 2022, growing to $5.6 billion.  Yet after a period of profitability, the online e-commerce platform provider has returned to its money-losing ways, generating a net loss of almost $3.5 billion last year, and Shopify is forecasting more losses to come.  The business was hurt when a reopening economy started to mean a return to normalcy for many in the workplace, and Shopify's stock reflected the trend, losing 84% of its value over the course of the year ending last October. From that low point, though, the shares soared some 126% before partly reversing course after the latest results.  It seemed like Shopify stock was starting to rediscover its mojo. Can it last? Or will it collapse again under the weight of mounting losses? Let's weigh the bear and bull cases to find out.¬†  ## Everything is fine  Shopify is not the same company that went public seven years ago. It has expanded beyond the narrow confines of helping small businesses establish an internet presence and become a vertically integrated operation offering a suite of apps that can be plugged into a merchant's website for greater functionality.¬†   In addition, Shopify now offers customers point-of-sale capabilities, payments options, small business loans, and multichannel opportunities for businesses to sell on social media. It's also building out its own fulfillment and logistics network, and recently acquired Deliverr for $2.1 billion in a bid to create an end-to-end fulfillment ecosystem.    While Shopify hasn't forgotten its humble small- and medium-sized business beginnings, the platform now calls some of the biggest corporations its clients, including General Mills, Heineken, Kraft Heinz, **Mattel**, Black &amp; Decker, and ButcherBox.  Gross merchandise value jumped 12% in 2022 to $197 billion and was up 16% on a constant-currency basis as total revenue soared 21% from last year. Gross profit dollars also rose $2.8 billion, or an 11% increase compared to 2021.  Although Shopify trails well behind **Amazon**, it actually has the second-largest share of U.S. e-commerce retail sales. As online shopping continues to become the norm for millions of consumers, and Shopify makes easily accessible tools available for businesses of all sizes, there doesn't seem to be any impediment to the e-commerce platform provider growing further.¬†  [https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/02/20/shopify-stock-bear-vs-bull/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/02/20/shopify-stock-bear-vs-bull/),;,; 2023-02-21 06:33:26]
[Pre-market Most Active Stocks on 23 June. How's your trades Bullish or Bearish?,;,; ,;,; 2023-06-23 13:12:05]
[Worse case scenario: the perfect Bear cocktail,;,; After reading all the comments from my last post and doing some more thinking. I decided to entertain the idea of what would be the perfect Bear cocktail that could trigger a Stock Market destabilization. I'm not taking into account any type of positive news. I'm simply going the negative route, in a slow and systematic manner, without any huge trigger events.  What am I missing and at what dates that's important and could also add to this?  If you notice in the prior post list, three out of six times... rising interest rates were part of the cause that brought the market down at least 20%. Oil price shocks two out of 6. Then there¬¥s speculative investments at the dotcom bubble. Covid, overvaluation, trade tensions... Stagflation. So these have to be in the mix one way or another:     Cocktail Potential Ingredients:   1. Rising interest rates.   2. Oil price shocks.   3. Speculative tech investments.   4. Overvaluation.   5. Trade tensions.   6. Stagflation.   7. New round of Covid-19.   8. Housing or Commercial Real Estate Bubble.     So this is the speculative worse case scenario we could have without going as far as having a WWIII:     February 13, 2024: CPI report comes in hot. S&amp;P500 comes down 1.5%, some buy the tiny dip.   February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix.  February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases.  Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report.   February 21, 2024: Nvidia posts earnings, they actually do fine but investors realize that¬¥s gonna be the ceiling for now so the stock falls 15%. Other tech stocks get stained by the fear, bringing the S&amp;P500 2.5% lower. AI investment sentiments leans towards potentially speculative for now.  March 12, 2024: February¬¥s CPI report comes in hot again, causing Algorithmic trades to sell and bring down the S&amp;P500 another 2%.  March 19-20, 2024: FOMC Meeting gives subtext of potentially not bringing interest rates down yet. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterates emphasis on the central bank's commitment to combating inflation, even if it requires keeping interest rates high for an extended period. This brings down the market sentiment down and numbers another 1%.   April 5, 2024:  In a CNBC YouTube video report, experts delve into the complexities of the current commercial real estate (CRE) market. The rise of remote work led to a decreased demand for office spaces, the pandemic trained people to make purchases online, commercial real estate bubble starts to show symptoms of cracking up.   April 10, 2024: CPI report is on ambiguous. Not up, not down. Anything could happen at this point. Aprils report will define what the FED will do and the next 6 months of stock market activity. Market loses .5%  April 17, 2024: Tom Lee's bullish perspective has been challenged by the prior events and during an interview he mentions that this was the turmoil he had been expecting but sees the S&amp;P500 going back to 5,200 points by the end of the year. Currently at 4,600... 7.5% below all time highs.  May 1, 2024: FOMC Meeting leaves a bad taste in mouth. Jerome shifts narrative towards not lowering interests rates yet. Market falls another 2.5% on the bad sentiment.  May 15, 2024:  Situations in the Middle East, such as tensions in Gaza or Iran, could impact global oil supplies by affecting regional stability and energy infrastructure. Saudi Arabia, a key OPEC member, might alter its oil production strategy in response to shifts in global politics, economic pressures, or changes in energy demand. Actions perceived as irrational could stem from strategic decisions to protect national interests, influence oil prices, or respond to international events. S&amp;P500 falls 0.5%.  July 8, 2024: A new wave of Covid-19 actually breaks through the collective deceit of it being over because death rates rise significantly and word spreads out again from hospital staff that's it's getting real bad. Stock market reacts in a mixed manner. Amazon and tech companies go up a little, small caps enter another bad rout. S&amp;P500 falls 1%.  July 20, 2024: Numbers start to confirm a Stagflation situation actually taking place. A significant slowdown in economic growth, rising unemployment rates, declining consumer spending, and a contraction in manufacturing. Inflation pressures, coupled with tightening monetary policies aimed at controlling price levels, contribute to decreased economic activity. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions serve as catalysts, further straining global markets. The interconnectedness of these factors in precipitate a recessionary environment. S&amp;P500 falls .7%.  July 23, 2024: Nvidia reports and disappoints, falls another 8% in tandem with other tech companies.  July 25, 2024: Commercial Real Estate bubble pops and hits the news hard. S&amp;P500 falls 1.4% At 13.6% the all time highs from January 2024. Currently at 4,400 points.  August 14, 2024: After all the earnings reports it becomes increasingly clear: the FED won't lower rates and will keep them there for longer than expected; consumer spending is declining, companies keep firing people, the Bear narrative takes over. The S&amp;P500 falls to 4,010 points. 23.5% below all time highs. It stays around here for the next 6 months, falls further and gets better by the end of 2025.   ,;,; 2024-02-13 19:00:48]
[Investment plan for about 85 000$ USD over the coming year,;,; So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years.  I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030.  However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.  I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.  The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)  Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco **S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&amp;P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)  So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?  Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :),;,; 2023-07-17 13:28:09]
[Bed Bath &amp; Beyond files for bankruptcy after sales collapse dooms home retailer,;,; Bed Bath &amp; Beyond ($BBBY) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sunday after a years-long decline in sales doomed the home goods retailer.  In a statement on Sunday, the company said its Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and buybuy BABY stores will remain open "as the Company begins its efforts to effectuate the closure of its retail locations." Sixth Street will provide the company with $240 million in debtor-in-possession financing, which will allow the company to continue operations during its wind-down process.   Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had been exploring "strategic alternatives" for its business dating back to January. That plan spiraled, as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond‚Äôs first funding partner bailed after less than two months.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ms6mccu2prva1.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1fd738f6001e9505f5662ebea5bfeb889b981ec     In the most recent quarter, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond reported sales dropped 33% while adjusted losses totaled $225 million. Shares of the company have lost 98% over the last year; year-to-date, the stock was down 88% through Friday's close.  After peaking at $12.3 billion in 2017, sales at the retailer have collapsed in recent years, totaling just $7.9 billion in 2021, its lowest annual tally since 2009. Through the first three quarters of 2022, the company was on pace for sales that would have matched levels reported in the mid-2000s.  While private labels have become an increasing part of the growth story for Target , Macy‚Äôs, Walmart, and other large retailers, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond fell behind. The company's decline was only accelerated by the pandemic as shoppers switched to online retailers like Amazon and Wayfair.   From bath towels and hand soap to air fryers and board games, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond was once the go-to spot for suburban families and incoming college students to fill their homes.  But in recent years, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stores have been better known for discounts and empty shelves.  After losing a cumulative $1.4 billion from 2018-2021, the company lost more than a billion dollars through the first three quarters of 2022.  Last month, the company announced plans for a shareholder vote on a reverse stock split set for May 9 in an effort to shore up its liquidity and come into compliance with Nasdaq listing rules after its stock fell below $1 per share. The company noted in an SEC filing that boosting the stock price was its last hope at survival.  "A failure to obtain shareholder approval for the Reverse Split Proposal will likely force us to file for bankruptcy," the company said in the SEC filing.  Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had announced a funding deal with Hudson Bay Capital on February 7 to raise more than $1 billion over the next year. But provisions in that deal required Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's stock price to stay above certain levels.  As the stock dropped from above $5 per share in February to less than $1 per share in late March, Hudson Bay's funding deal ended.   The money from Hudson Bay, as well as Bed Bath &amp; Beyond‚Äôs new funding partner, B. Riley Securities, was meant to restock shelves, pay back vendors, and revive sales at stores that were still operating.  ‚ÄúHaving inventory and having the right inventory will help them," Goldman Sachs analyst Kate McShane told Yahoo Finance Live on April 6 after Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's latest round of funding.  ## The end of meme madness   Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stock closed at $0.29 ahead of the company's bankruptcy filing, down roughly $80 a share from its all-time high in December 2013. Investor Ryan Cohen, who catalyzed the market's interest in GameStop, took a 9.8% stake in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond in March 2022 and company shares soared. The company wrote in an SEC filing that a reverse-stock split could help make the stock "more attractive" to investors. In mid-August 2022, shares closed as high as $23. Cohen sold his entire stake in the company the same month.,;,; 2023-04-24 05:30:16]
[Top Tech stocks to consider: Unlocking high potential investments for Tech enthusiasts,;,; ## A combination of recent performance, future opportunities, and attractive valuations makes these stocks compelling right now.  Despite the recent sell-off of tech stocks, this sector is still a favourite among investors -- and for good reason. Technology companies are fun and exciting to learn about and follow, and many of their products are consumer-facing favourites of many investors.  In the current higher-interest-rate environment, the price paid for stocks matters more than it has in recent history. With that in mind, there are some stocks that are still trading for reasonable or cheap valuations that present attractive buying opportunities right now. Let's take a look at three of those stocks to see what makes them great buys.  ## PayPal  For many years, the story of **PayPal** **(PYPL** **1.43%)** was one of expansion, with revenue growth averaging around 17% each quarter. More recently, management decided to prioritize increasing the activity of its existing customers. The recent results show that this may have been a wise decision.  One example is how much more valuable each account has become to PayPal's bottom line. In the first quarter of 2023, active accounts remained relatively stable year over year, while transactions per active account have increased by 13%. This is proof that the focus on driving higher activity levels on existing accounts is paying off.  ## DigitalOcean  The leaders in cloud infrastructure are household names. **Amazon**¬†Web Services (AWS), **Alphabet**'s Google Cloud, and **Microsoft**'s Azure are the clear leaders in the space. However, smaller upstart **DigitalOcean** (**DOCN** **4.99%)** is not only holding its own, but it's also growing faster than its tech giant competitors.¬†  DigitalOcean caters to small and medium-sized businesses by offering affordable and transparent pricing as well as substantial customer support. This strategy has been paying off. In Q1 2023, DigitalOcean grew its revenue by 30% year over year, outpacing its competition. For comparison, AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure increased by 16%, 28%, and 27%, respectively.  DigitalOcean is also growing its largest customers even more rapidly than its revenue. Customers that spend more than $50 per month, called "builders and scalers," increased by 43% year over year. These customers now represent 86% of total revenue. This is an important metric to keep an eye on as it is an indicator of how DigitalOcean is able to continue to serve its customers as they grow and scale.  The company has only been on the public markets for a few years, but it's currently trading for valuation multiples below its historical average and not far from its all-time lows.  ## Endava  **Endava** (**DAVA** **2.53%)** may not be a household name for investors, but it should be. This IT consulting company has been putting up impressive numbers despite the fact that its stock is down 34% year to date and down 70% from its late 2021 high.  Third-quarter 2023 results, which represent the quarter ending in March, were impressive with revenue and earnings per share increasing by 20% year over year. Endava is also consistently cash flow positive, and it generated a 10% free cash flow margin for the quarter.¬†  Endava has been growing its roster of large customers impressively. The number of clients spending more than 1 million British pounds ($1.24 million) in revenue reached 155 in Q3, an increase of 31% year over year. The overall customer base is also becoming more diversified. Endava's top-10 clients represented 33% of total revenue in Q3, down from 35% in the year-ago quarter.  The stock took a hit after earnings, mostly due to the fact that the company lowered its fiscal 2023 guidance. However, management thinks that slowing revenue from the private equity part of its customer base is a temporary pause due to the fallout relating to the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March.  Endava trades for three times sales and 25 times earnings, both of which are near all-time lows. With strong results even in the face of some important customers' short-term challenges, the current valuation is compelling for this quickly growing business.,;,; 2023-05-30 10:29:38]
[Better Cathie Wood stock: Roku vs. Shopify,;,;    **Roku** and **Shopify** are two of Cathie Wood's favorite long-term holdings. The famed growth investor's flagship exchange-traded fund, the **Ark Innovation ETF**, holds Roku as its second-largest position (7.99% of its portfolio) and Shopify as its eighth-largest position (4.55%).  Both companies grew rapidly throughout the pandemic as consumers watched more streaming videos on Roku's devices and did more online shopping through Shopify-powered storefronts. But they both faced tough post-pandemic slowdowns as those tailwinds dissipated, and rising interest rates exacerbated that pressure by driving investors away from higher-growth stocks.   That's why in 2022, Roku's stock plunged 82%, Shopify's stock fell 75%, and the Ark Innovation ETF shed 67% of its value. But since the beginning of 2023, shares of Roku and Shopify have both soared more than 70% as the Ark Innovation ETF rallied 36%. Does that rebound indicate it's finally safe to buy either stock again?   #  Roku's post-pandemic slowdown isn't over yet  Roku's revenue rose 58% in 2020 and 55% in 2021, but grew just 13% to $3.1 billion in 2022 as its platform and device businesses faced near-term challenges. Its higher-margin platform business, which sells ads across its Roku OS and free Roku Channel, struggled as the macro headwinds forced companies to rein in their ad spending. Its lower-margin device business grappled with supply chain constraints, high component prices, and stiff competition from other streaming device makers.    Roku's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) turned negative with a loss of $84 million in 2022, compared to a profit of $465 million in 2021, as its platform gross margins shrank and its device gross margins remained negative throughout the entire year. That pressure on its device business will likely worsen because it's absorbing its higher supply chain costs instead of passing them onto its consumers. It also recently launched its own first-party Roku TVs, which it will likely need to sell at paper-thin margins or even losses to remain competitive.    On the bright side, Roku's audience continues to expand. It ended the first quarter of 2023 with 71.6 million active accounts, representing 17% growth from a year earlier, and its streaming hours continue to rise sequentially and year over year. Unfortunately, the softness of its advertising business is still making it hard to grow its average revenue per user (ARPU), which declined 5% year over year in the first quarter.  For 2023, analysts expect Roku's revenue to rise 5% to $3.3 billion, but they expect its adjusted EBITDA loss to widen to $269 million. But in 2024 they expect its revenue growth to accelerate again as its adjusted EBITDA turns positive.   #  Shopify's post-pandemic growth is stabilizing   Shopify's self-service e-commerce tools enable merchants to launch their own online storefronts, process payments fulfilll orders, and manage their own marketing campaigns. That flexibility makes it a popular choice for sellers who don't want to join a crowded third-party marketplace like **Amazon**. It also became an essential tool for both merchants and customers when brick-and-mortar stores closed down during the pandemic.    Shopify's revenue rose 86% in 2020 and another 57% in 2021. Its adjusted net income jumped 1,332% in 2020 and grew 66% in 2021. But in 2022, its revenue only grew 21% as its adjusted net income plunged 94%. Its top-line growth cooled off as the pandemic passed, but it continued to ramp up its spending to expand its lower-margin Shop Pay payments platform and logistics network. Its acquisitions of 6 River Systems and Deliver, which were both aimed at strengthening its logistics capabilities, exacerbated that pressure on its operating margins.    Shopify's slowing growth and plummeting profits rattled the bulls, but the company has recently made some drastic changes. During its first-quarter earnings report, management told investors that Shopify would sell its entire logistics division to Flexport for a 13% stake in the private company. It also said it would lay off about a fifth of its workforce to stabilize its profits.¬†  As a result, analysts expect Shopify's revenue to rise 20% in 2023 as its adjusted EPS grows a whopping 700%.   #  The valuations and verdict  Roku trades at three times this year's sales, while Shopify trades at 13 times this year's sales. Roku is trading at a lower valuation because it hasn't convinced the market its business model is sustainable, but investors are still paying a premium for the long-term growth potential of Shopify's e-commerce services.  I wouldn't rush to buy either of these stocks right now. But if I had to choose one over the other, I'd stick with Shopify because it's growing faster, making bolder decisions, and its business model seems more disruptive.,;,; 2023-06-14 07:39:16]

[Don't miss out on the rebound: Grab these super stocks on the dip,;,;    ## 1. Confluent's largest customer cohort continues to outperform  Data streaming is a technology rapidly growing in importance for businesses because consumers are increasingly demanding more live experiences from their digital products and services. **Confluent** **(****CFLT****)** is a leader in the industry, and some of the largest companies in the world are flocking to its platform.  https://preview.redd.it/1d47wfra1c1b1.png?width=879&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18d11ba93beb4cb1dc036b0c617549b74d19a8d2     Cloud computing allows businesses to operate online, and every interaction within their digital ecosystem creates data. The ability to use that information instantly is a game changer for the customer experience; a retailer, for example, can manage inventory in real time so products never go out of stock. And an online sports betting platform can offer live markets during a game because data streaming allows them to calculate odds, feed them to the users, and accept bets -- all within seconds.  The technology has implications for almost every industry, and International Data Corp. predicts 90% of the world's 1,000 largest companies will be using it by 2025.   In the first quarter of 2023, Confluent generated $174.3 million in revenue, up 38% year over year and well above its $168 million forecast. But there was an even more impressive figure: The number of businesses spending $1 million or more on Confluent's platform surged 53% -- more than three times faster than the company's customer base grew overall.     ## 2. DigitalOcean continues to outgrow its trillion-dollar competitors  **DigitalOcean** **(****DOCN** **-2.30%)** is a provider of cloud computing services that allow its customers to store data, host websites, and even develop software. It has one significant point of difference from its major competitors like **Amazon**¬†Web Services (AWS) and **Microsoft**¬†Azure: DigitalOcean targets small to medium-sized businesses with under 500 employees.  https://preview.redd.it/j5ogu8pz1c1b1.png?width=877&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9d5ea9ad7f757754226d5a6593c27779b6bc798   It's a lucrative segment of the cloud market because DigitalOcean can develop a relationship with businesses in their start-up phase and then reap the financial rewards when they begin to scale up. The company offers personalized service, cheap pricing, and a simple cloud platform with one-click deployment tools designed to suit its target customers. Other cloud providers are more focused on large enterprise customers, so they don't typically offer a competing value proposition for small businesses.¬†    As of Q1, DigitalOcean had 146,500 customers spending more than $50 per month. That includes 15,000 "scalers," which are its top spenders, each contributing an average of $1,962 per month to DigitalOcean's revenue. Speaking of which, the company generated $165.1 million in revenue during the quarter, marking an increase of 30% year over year. That was a faster growth rate for the period than AWS¬†(16%), Microsoft Azure (27%), and **Alphabet**'s Google Cloud (28%) delivered!  &amp;#x200B;  ## 3. Redfin stock has soared 149% in 2023  **Redfin**'s **(****RDFN** **-4.18%)** got off to a strong start in 2023, with the stock price up 149% so far this year. But it's still down 88% from its all-time high. The real estate technology company struggled over the last 18 months because the U.S. Federal Reserve embarked on the most aggressive campaign to hike interest rates in its history to fight soaring inflation. That's directly impacting demand for housing because consumers can't afford to borrow as much money, leading to a slowdown in Redfin's business.  https://preview.redd.it/f9q0wwkd2c1b1.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09c39ca2be669cca3c9cb6df40d69816a7367bc1  Redfin employs 1,876 lead agents covering 98% of the U.S. housing market (geographically), allowing the company to operate at a level of scale that smaller independent realtors can't match. As a result, it charges listing fees as low as 1%, undercutting the more common rate of 2.5% and creating a win-win for Redfin and its sellers.  The company is so popular that it represented 0.78% of the nearly 2 million houses sold in America during the first quarter of 2023. That might not sound like a big number, but there are 3 million registered agents across the country, so Redfin is punching well above its weight.  Due to the absence of direct buying, Redfin's revenue crashed 45% in Q1 compared to the same quarter last year (as expected). But Redfin is now a much leaner, healthier business, and it expects to deliver positive non-GAAP earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) this year. That's primarily why investors have sent Redfin stock soaring in 2023, and it might just be getting warmed up.,;,; 2023-05-22 07:24:34]

InnerScope and HearingAssist are doing their part by raising public awareness for a call to action on early detection of hearing loss by first promoting access to FREE Hearing Screenings and early treatment of hearing loss, with easy access to HearingAssist's Affordable OTC Hearing Aids, now available nationwide at 1500+ Walmart Vision Centers and on [Walmart.com](https://Walmart.com).  &amp;#x200B;  Find out what you are hearing and what you are not!  &amp;#x200B;  Click Here: HearingAssist FREE Online Quick Hearing Check  &amp;#x200B;  Today, 48 million Americans have some degree of hearing loss, and half of those with hearing loss are younger than age 65. Hearing Loss is the third most common health problem among older adults in the U.S. Currently, tens of millions of Americans with untreated hearing loss (those with hearing loss who do not wear hearing aids) experience a decreased quality of life. Untreated hearing loss can lead to sadness, isolation, depression, anxiety, paranoia, cognitive decline, and poor social relationships.  &amp;#x200B;  A new study published in JAMA this January shows that hearing loss increases the risk of dementia. However, the study also found that wearing hearing aids to treat hearing loss lowers the risks of dementia in older adults. Despite numerous studies showing the increased risk of health problems associated with untreated hearing loss, including accelerated brain atrophy or shrinkage, the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) reports that of the 28.8 million Americans (age 20-69) who could benefit from wearing hearing aids, fewer than 16% have ever used them, mostly due to the lack of access to affordable hearing aids.  &amp;#x200B;  "World Hearing Day is a great opportunity to bring much-needed awareness to the general public about hearing loss and the poorer quality of life if left untreated," said Matthew Moore, President and CEO of InnerScope Hearing Technologies. "The most common treatment for hearing loss is hearing aids. Yet, the lack of awareness of the increased risks of mental health problems associated with untreated hearing loss, and the lack of accessibility to affordable hearing aids, caused millions of people to live with the health consequences of untreated hearing loss. We have always believed that greater access to more affordable hearing aids could improve the lives of those with untreated self-perceived mild to moderate hearing loss.

[The Bad Economics Of The Audio Streaming Industry (Spotify Example),;,; Hey everyone, before I share with you my thoughts on Spotify, I thought it might be a good idea to share a famous quote from Warren Buffett, which I think applies to the audio streaming market: *'When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact'.*  This posts breaks down:  * Overview of Spotify * Economics of the Audio Streaming Business * Why I think its bad economics for investors  # Spotify Overview:   Spotify is one of the world‚Äôs most popular audio streaming subscription service giving access to over 100 million tracks and 5 million podcasts to millions of members. Spotify is the leader in the audio streaming market with a market share of 30.5% and Spotify has been growing their premium subscribers every year with no signs of slowing down.  *Premium Subscribers (In Millions)*  |**2015**|**2016**|**2017**|**2018**|**2019**|**2020**|**2021**|**2022**|**2023 (2Qs)**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |92|154|244|341|445|567|675|770|*430\**|  In 2022, the global audio streaming market was around $34 billion. The audio streaming market is expected to grow to over $100 billion by 2030 according to research and markets. Despite Spotify's growth and the growth of the industry at large, the economics of Spotify and other businesses in this market doesn't appear to be looking good at all and in my opinion I don't see signs of improvement. I will explain the economics of the industry a little below but I will first present revenue and profitability in years 2015 &amp; 2022:  *Revenue (In Millions)*  |**2015**|**2022**| |:-|:-| |$1,940|$11,727|  *Profitability (In Millions)*  |**2015**|**2022**| |:-|:-| |($235)|($689)|  Although I only present these two years, operating losses for this company has been consistent in all years between this period. Someone has to cover the cost of the money losing operations of Spotify and it looks as if shareholders has been footing the bill. Shares outstanding has been increasing.  Shares outstanding:  |**2015**|**2022**| |:-|:-| |141,946,000|195,846,362|  I believe Spotify can continue to grow revenue but I think the path to profitability is no where near in sight. Looking more closely into the economics of the audio streaming business, it appears that Spotify **doesn't have a moat** and I don't think any competitor can gain an advantage in this industry.  # Economics of the Audio Streaming Business   There are certain rules in this industry that prevent any company from gaining any real advantage from another. The audio streaming business is subject to a ‚Äòmost favored nation clause‚Äô, which sounds complicated but it essentially means that audio streaming providers such as Spotify is in some ways restricted from negotiating exclusive deals with artists. Let‚Äôs say Spotify has agreed to a deal with a music publisher at $10,000, and this deal contains a most favoured nation clause, if another publisher comes in and agrees to a $15,000 deal with Spotify, then Spotify will have to pay the same amount to first publisher. For example, let‚Äôs say Spotify signed an agreement that gives it permission to stream **The Weeknd** ***(which is the most listened artist on Spotify)*** on its platform. And this agreement contains a MFN clause. The way this works is that Spotify will need to pay royalties to the Universal Music Group, which is the Weeknd‚Äôs publisher, every time a song is played on its platform. The Royalty rates are set by the Copyright Royalty Board which establishes the minimum rate a streaming service has to pay their artists. If Spotify signs a new agreement with **Rihanna,** and Spotify pays Rihanna's publisher (Sony/ATV) a higher amount to stream her songs on the platform, then Spotify will have to pay the difference to the Weekend Publisher because of the clause agreement. This applies to other audio streaming services such as Apple Music, Youtube Music, etc.  # Why this is bad economics for Spotify investors    **Reason 1:** Since it is in the best interests of music artists to go after those MFN agreements; this really prevents any audio streaming service from signing exclusive deals with music artists that prevent from being streamed on other platforms. It is also the goal of a music artist to promote their music as far and as wide as possible and be to paid the maximum amount, and to do that, any major artist, or any artist in general will also have similar agreements with other streaming platforms, giving none of these platforms any competitive advantage. ***This is very different from video streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, who has their own production studio and exclusive rights to TV shows and movies.***  **Reason 2:** As someone who likes listening to music, it really doesn‚Äôt bother me what platform I use, as long I can listen to the music I like. So I really struggle to find any competitive advantage Spotify has and because of that, I‚Äôm not really sure if Spotify can maintain its position in the market without spending an excessive amount. And from what we have already seen, Spotify is already struggling to keep its costs down so achieving a sustainable level of profits in the future is very hard to predict.  **Reason 3:** Competition. Since the audio streaming market is huge and is expected to grow, this will attract new competitors into the market. Without a competitive advantage (other than a well-known brand - not very durable) Spotify will likely need to increase their costs further in the future to maintain and protect its market share of 30.5%. If more competitors enter the market, then Spotify will need to increase marketing costs to attract new consumers, this expense may increase by a lot. Since Spotify is a technology company, research and development costs will need to continually increase, since old and new competitors will be investing to improve their audio streaming service so they take market share from Spotify. Another problem is pricing. Let‚Äôs imagine a new competitor enters the market and sells their streaming service at a lower price than Spotify. Spotify will then need to reduce its subscription costs to prevent their members from cancelling their membership and signing up with a competitor.  Those are my thoughts on Spotify and the economics of the audio streaming business. As a consumer and a lover of music, we gain the benefit of competition. However, I think the consumer benefit will continue to come at the expense of shareholders. Of course, I could be wrong. Please share your thoughts on Spotify and whether you agree or disagree with my review, I welcome any discussion :)  Hope everyone is enjoying their day.,;,; 2023-11-02 13:05:22]
[An Open Letter to the CEO and directors of Cloudflare,;,;    To Mr. Matthew Prince, and Directors of Cloudflare,  My name is Ming Wong, and I am the CEO of Zetalon Ltd., a company that has been a committed investor and free user of Cloudflare's services. I am penning this open letter to express my concerns and provide suggestions that, I believe, could contribute to the financial performance and longevity of Cloudflare.  Despite the company's remarkable growth in customer base and service offerings since its initial public offering in 2019, the financial reports from 2019 to the present indicate a continuous operation at a loss, with a reported loss of $190.1M in 2022. This persistent inability to turn a profit raises serious concerns about the company's long-term sustainability and its value creation for shareholders.  I understand that Cloudflare's strategy has been to build customer loyalty and support small websites to grow into large, paid websites. This is a commendable approach, and it has indeed resulted in a significant increase in Cloudflare's customer base. However, it is also clear that this strategy has not been successful in turning the company's impressive growth into profitability.  Cloudflare's growth and market presence are indeed impressive. The company boasts over 4 million customers, including 17% of Fortune 500 companies. It generated $431.06 million in revenue in 2020, a 5.08x increase since 2016. There are 7.59 million active websites using Cloudflare, and the company has 119,206 paying customers. These paying customers produced 88.84% of the revenue, indicating a significant reliance on a relatively small portion of the user base.  Despite this impressive market share, Cloudflare has fewer high-traffic websites compared to competitors like Akamai, Amazon CloudFront, and Fastly. This is a clear indication that the company's current strategy is not fully capitalizing on its potential.  Importantly, Cloudflare provides its services at a more affordable rate than many of its competitors, including BelugaCDN, Amazon Web Services, Stack Path, Microsoft Azure, and Google. This competitive pricing gives Cloudflare an edge in attracting customers, particularly small and medium enterprises looking for cost-effective solutions. While this strategy contributes to Cloudflare's expansive customer base, it further underlines the necessity of increasing revenue streams beyond just customer subscriptions.  However, the current financial performance poses potential risks to the shareholders. Continuous operation at a loss can diminish shareholder value over time, which could eventually lead to shareholder dissatisfaction and the potential for capital flight. Shareholder value should not be an afterthought; rather, it is a primary goal that aligns with the company's growth and success.  To address this and enhance profitability, I propose a strategic shift in Cloudflare's approach to its free services. Here are the specific changes I propose:  Limit Free Plan Features: Disallow features like Async JavaScript Loading with Rocket Loader and Multi-User Administrative Access and Read-only User Access in the free plan. Also, limit the number of free custom hostnames from 100 to 50. These changes will encourage multi-employee companies to upgrade to a paid plan.  Introduce Ads on the "Checking your browser before accessing" Page: By forcing this page to be shown on all free websites, it can serve as an effective platform for displaying ads, providing an additional revenue stream. This change could also serve as a stepping stone for Cloudflare to develop its own ad network, further diversifying its revenue streams.  Introduce a $20 per Year Plan: Replace the current free plan with a $20 per year plan. This nominal fee is affordable for most users and can generate significant revenue given Cloudflare's large user base.  Although these changes may entail risks such as potential customer dissatisfaction and a possible initial decrease in the user base, it is important to emphasize the long-term benefits. Implementing these changes could not only result in increased revenue but also lead to a diversified business model less reliant on customer subscriptions alone. This diversification could reduce risk in the long term and lead to a more robust, resilient business. Moreover, the profitability from these strategic shifts could significantly increase shareholder value over time, securing the company's longevity and growth prospects.  Here are some rough estimates:  If 25% of the 7.48 million free websites move to the $20 per year plan, that's 1.87 million websites. At $20 per website per year, the potential revenue increase would be $37.4 million per year.  Assuming 25% of websites stop using Cloudflare, the remaining free plan users would be 3.24 million websites. Assuming the average daily traffic of the websites is 100, that's 324 million page views per day. Over a year, that's approximately 118.26 billion page views. With a $3 CPM, the average CPM of Google Display Network ads, the potential ad revenue would be approximately $354.780 million per year.  So, the total potential revenue increase from both the $20 per year plan and the ads would be approximately $392.18 million per year. This revenue increase not only covers the $193.4 million loss reported in 2022 but also potentially results in a significant profit.  I understand and appreciate the reasoning behind Cloudflare's commitment to a free service, and I am cognizant of the factors that make it such an invaluable asset. I'd like to address each of these points:  Data: Cloudflare's ability to gather a wide array of data from its free service users, thereby enhancing protection for paid users, is indeed commendable. My proposition for limiting features on the free plan and the introduction of a $20 per year plan should not compromise this ability. A lower-tiered paid plan may even encourage more users to sign up, potentially offering a larger data set.  Customer Referrals: I recognize that customer referrals, particularly from satisfied users of the free service, play a pivotal role in attracting larger customers. I believe that a $20 per year plan would continue to offer tremendous value, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction and continuing to drive referrals.  Employee Referrals: I acknowledge the importance of the free plan in attracting potential employees. I propose that, with careful communication and strategic rollout, the changes will be accepted and will continue to attract top talent to Cloudflare.  QA: Offering new features to free customers for testing is indeed a unique and valuable approach. The changes I propose should not interfere with this. On the contrary, a more diverse range of customers due to a $20 plan may provide even more varied feedback and testing.  Bandwidth Chicken &amp; Egg: I understand the role of free customers in achieving the scale necessary for competitive pricing and regional peering. By introducing a reasonably priced $20 per year plan, I believe that we can maintain, if not increase, the diversity and scale of our customer base.  Looking ahead, I believe that Cloudflare holds substantial growth opportunities, which, if tapped into strategically, could enhance long-term benefits for both the company and its shareholders. Specifically, I would like to highlight three potential areas of expansion:  Ad Networks: By introducing ads on the "Checking your browser before accessing" page, Cloudflare could diversify its revenue streams and lay the foundation for establishing its own ad network. Ad networks have been profitable ventures for many tech companies, and with Cloudflare's broad user base, there is significant potential for high returns.  Web Hosting Services: Cloudflare's existing infrastructure and network capacity make it an ideal candidate to offer web hosting services. This could attract a new customer segment that's looking for a one-stop-shop for their website needs, generating additional revenue while enhancing the company's value proposition.  Virtual Private Servers (VPS): The growing trend towards remote work and online businesses increases the demand for reliable and affordable VPS. By offering VPS services, Cloudflare could capitalize on this trend and further strengthen its market position.  By expanding into these areas, Cloudflare would not only diversify its offerings but also create synergies with its existing services. For instance, customers using Cloudflare's web hosting or VPS services could be more likely to use other Cloudflare services, creating a more integrated and stickier customer base.  Moreover, these new revenue streams could greatly enhance the long-term financial performance of the company. While the initial investment might be substantial, the potential for increased and diversified revenue could outweigh the costs in the long term, driving profitability, and thereby enhancing shareholder value.  While I believe that the changes, I propose carry significant potential for profit and growth, I am aware that they also present certain risks. Therefore, I find it essential to acknowledge and consider these risks in your decision-making process.  Customer Backlash: Changes to the free plan could lead to a backlash from current free users. However, it's important to note that even with these changes, Cloudflare's services are still very competitively priced. Therefore, despite changes to the free plan, Cloudflare will continue to provide excellent value for its users. Nevertheless, careful communication about these changes and potentially introducing transitional measures could help manage this risk effectively.  Competitive Dynamics: A change in Cloudflare's pricing structure could potentially alter competitive dynamics in the market, possibly inciting competitive responses from other CDN and cloud service providers.  Ad Network Viability: While the potential revenue from ads is significant, building an ad network also involves challenges. Besides the technical challenges, it may also take time to attract advertisers and achieve profitable scale.  Diversification Risks: While diversifying into web hosting services and VPS may seem attractive, it's important to consider that Cloudflare would be competing in a new market with its own competitive dynamics and established players. Moreover, the investment required to establish a presence in these markets could be substantial.  As with any strategic decisions, it's crucial to balance the potential rewards with the inherent risks. While the strategies I propose carry risks, I believe that with careful planning and execution, these risks can be effectively managed. Moreover, the potential long-term benefits in terms of revenue growth, profitability, and shareholder value are significant.  I am confident in Cloudflare's potential for growth and profitability. However, it is crucial that the management team takes decisive action to address the current profitability issues. The proposed strategies are not just about improving the financial performance of the company, but also about fulfilling the company's responsibilities to its shareholders.  Thank you for taking the time to consider my concerns and proposals. I firmly believe that these strategic shifts would significantly enhance Cloudflare's profitability and shareholder value. I urge the board to conduct a thorough review of the proposed strategies and consider implementing them for the long-term success of the company.  I look forward to your response and to seeing Cloudflare seize these growth opportunities, ensuring a prosperous future for all stakeholders.  Best regards,  Ming Wong  CEO, Zetalon Ltd.

[Alibaba Group: Navigating with ‚Äú1+6+N‚Äù into Digital Era,;,;    https://preview.redd.it/1p62nwkzja6c1.png?width=1654&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d94fa024f7a9261c2f3fb268d80ecf370bad28c  ### Key Takeaways:  * Alibaba Group is focusing on AI-driven technology and a global commerce network as key priorities for the next decade. * Recent restructuring introduces a ‚Äú1+6+N‚Äù governance model, fostering agility and innovation. * Alibaba is intensively investing in core businesses, distinguishing them from non-core segments. * The company remains committed to shareholder returns, with significant share repurchases + dividend payment in fiscal year 2024. * Alibaba‚Äôs cloud computing platform is the third largest globally, emphasizing AI and cloud convergence.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/bvl0d1lxja6c1.png?width=1772&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f84060657a39d2381daa8efec8dd562ed5145d58  ### Company Overview:  Founded in 1999, Alibaba Group Holding Limited began with a mission to empower small businesses through digital innovation. Today, it stands as a global leader in e-commerce, cloud computing, digital media, and other technological innovations. The company‚Äôs foundation lies in addressing customer needs and fostering an ecosystem where all participants create and share value. Known for its massive online marketplaces, Alibaba has expanded its reach into various sectors, positioning itself as a key player in the digital economy.  ### Alibaba‚Äôs Strategic Shift: Embracing AI and Global Commerce  Alibaba Group, under the leadership of CEO Yongming ‚ÄòEddie‚Äô Wu, is at a pivotal juncture, redefining its strategic direction to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving digital landscape. The company‚Äôs recent earnings call highlighted significant shifts in its operational and strategic focus, emphasizing the importance of AI-driven technology and a global commerce network as its primary growth drivers for the next decade.  The company is undergoing a transformation, focusing on establishing a nimble and fast decision-making governance structure. This shift is crucial as Alibaba contends with rapidly developing technologies and changing market expectations. The corporate governance reforms initiated this year aim to enhance the company‚Äôs entrepreneurial mindset and improve its decision-making systems.  Alibaba is also conducting a strategic review of its existing businesses, distinguishing between core and non-core segments. After 24 years, Alibaba is evolving from a single company into a new governance model of ‚Äú1+6+N‚Äù in which major business groups and various companies have independent operations.  ‚Äú1‚Äù represents Alibaba Group‚Äôs holding company, ‚Äú6‚Äù refers to six major business groups ‚Äì Cloud Intelligence Group, Taobao and Tmall Group, Local Services Group, Alibaba International Digital Commerce (AIDC) Group, Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited, and Digital Media and Entertainment Group, and ‚ÄúN‚Äù refers to various businesses such as Alibaba Health, Sun Art Retail, and Freshippo.  The company is intensively investing in its core businesses, pursuing R&amp;D, and enhancing user experiences to ensure long-term vitality and competitiveness. This approach is expected to maximize synergy across business groups, striking a balance between independence and cooperation.  In terms of financial performance, Alibaba remains committed to delivering shareholder value. During fiscal year 2023, the company repurchased approximately US$10.9 billion of its shares, representing a significant portion of its free cash flow. This move underscores Alibaba‚Äôs confidence in its financial health and long-term prospects.  Moreover, Alibaba‚Äôs cloud computing platform, the third largest globally, is set to play a pivotal role in the company‚Äôs future. The convergence of AI and cloud computing is identified as a key impetus for future development, signaling Alibaba‚Äôs commitment to technological innovation and transformation.  In summary, Alibaba Group is strategically positioning itself to navigate the challenges and opportunities of the new digital era. By focusing on AI-driven technologies, global commerce, and a reinvigorated corporate structure, the company is poised to unlock new growth avenues and reinforce its market leadership.  ### Recent Financials:  Alibaba‚Äôs diverse business model, spanning from China commerce to international commerce and digital media, has enabled it to maintain financial stability. Despite global economic fluctuations, Alibaba generated substantial free cash flow, evidencing its robust financial health. The company‚Äôs strategic investments in new technologies and talent, coupled with a significant share repurchase program, reflect its commitment to long-term value creation and shareholder returns.  Alibaba‚Äôs financial performance over the past few years has been noteworthy. The company has experienced a 5-year CAGR free cash flow growth of 12% and a FCF margin of 22%. Additionally, its 5-year CAGR revenue growth over the same period was about 28%. Despite the market‚Äôs negative sentiment, Alibaba‚Äôs net debt stands at an impressive -$51.48 billion, with a market capitalization of $183 billion. The fiscal year 2023 has shown improvement across all business segments, with notable growth in international commerce and steady performance in local services, digital media, and cloud services. Alibaba‚Äôs ability to maintain profitability and generate substantial cash flow, despite challenging market conditions, and political concerns speaks to its financial resilience and operational efficiency.  ### Financial Bullet Points:  * Revenue: RMB 224.79 billion (2023-09-30), **up** 8.5% YoY. * Gross Profit: RMB 85.13 billion (2023-09-30), 12.06% **increase** YoY. * Net Income: RMB 27.85 billion (2023-09-30), **significantly up** from a previous year‚Äôs loss. * Gross Margin: 37.87% (2023-09-30), an **increase** from 36.67% the previous year. * FCF Margin: 21.90% (2023-09-30), an **increase** from 16.89% the previous year.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/hhoymiovja6c1.png?width=1193&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0528b5afd12d68f769ef77bbe4758222378b7456  ### Business Model &amp; Competitors Analysis:  Alibaba‚Äôs business model is diverse, spanning e-commerce, cloud computing, digital media, and entertainment. Its major e-commerce platforms, Taobao and Tmall, are the cornerstone of its success, offering a wide range of products and services. Alibaba Cloud, the digital backbone of the company, provides cloud services and solutions, supporting businesses globally.  In terms of competition, Alibaba faces challenges from domestic players like Tencent and JD.com, as well as international giants like Amazon and Google, especially in cloud computing and digital services.  ### SWOT Analysis:  * **Strengths**: Strong market presence, diverse business portfolio, robust cloud computing services. * **Weaknesses**: Regulatory and political challenges, dependence on the Chinese market. * **Opportunities**: Expansion in international markets, advancements in AI and technology. * **Threats**: Intense competition, geopolitical tensions, and changing market dynamics.  ### Investment Outlook:  Alibaba‚Äôs current market valuation appears significantly undervalued, especially when considering its robust financials and market position. Analysis using discounted cash flow models suggests even with very low assumptions, that Alibaba‚Äôs fair value is more than double its current stock price. This undervaluation presents a substantial opportunity for investors. The company‚Äôs financial health, combined with its potential for growth and recovery, makes it a compelling choice for those looking to invest in a company with a strong foundation and promising future prospects. Despite the recent political challenges and market volatility, Alibaba‚Äôs fundamentals and strategic positioning hint at a significant upside potential in the coming years.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/rmo8zycuja6c1.png?width=898&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f9b835225efb9ff88b56622b163b5f8aca439b6  Loop Capital holds a perspective that Alibaba‚Äôs valuation does not factor in its international commerce, local services, logistics, digital media, and Ant Group segments. Despite this, they have set a price target of $115 for Alibaba, indicating a potential 65% upside. They also observe that the core e-commerce business of Alibaba is currently valued at 7 times earnings, which they consider to be a subdued valuation. Under more typical market conditions, Loop Capital suggests that a more appropriate multiple for this segment would be around 15 times earnings.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/00itg8asja6c1.jpg?width=692&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e4b8aa0cace10e185be1d460452f8a071d6ed1ea  ### Concluding Remarks:  Alibaba Group is at a transformative phase, strategically positioning itself for the future. With a strong financial foundation, a focus on AI and technology, and a commitment to core business segments, Alibaba is well-equipped to navigate the challenges and seize the opportunities of the digital era.   ,;,; 2023-12-14 16:59:55]
[Earnings wave, Credit Suisse ($CSGN) outflows, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond ($BBBY) bankruptcy‚Äîwhat's moving markets?,;,; U.S. futures point lower as investors look ahead to a wave of massive corporate earnings this week. Credit Suisse suffers significant first quarter outflows, underlining the challenges surrounding its shotgun marriage with rival UBS, while NBCUniversal's CEO resigns and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond files for bankruptcy.  **1. Futures drop as earnings season kicks into full gear**  High-profile corporate names, including some of the world's biggest technology groups, will unveil their latest results this week as concerns persist over a possible slowdown in the U.S. economy.  Companies faced a tumultuous quarter highlighted by stubbornly elevated (but easing) inflation, widespread tech sector layoffs, and the banking crisis.  Google-parent Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN), and Facebook-owned Meta Platforms, Inc. ($META) are all slated to report, along with chip-making giant Intel ($INTC). Consumer goods firm Mondelez International, Inc. ($MDLZ), oil major ExxonMobil Corp. ($XOM), payments processor Mastercard Inc. ($MA), drinks maker Coca-Cola Company ($KO) and drugmaker Eli Lilly and Company ($LLY) are also among the hundreds of businesses due to release their earnings in the coming days.  Last week, JPMorgan ($JPM) chief Jamie Dimon flagged looming economic "storm clouds" on the horizon, adding that the banking industry's recent issues have only exacerbated these fears. However, these worries were somewhat tempered by separate data on Friday which showed that business activity in the U.S. touched an 11-month high in April.  **2.** **Credit Suisse's 'alarming' results**  Credit Suisse ($CSGN) saw CHF 61.2 billion in asset outflows in the first quarter in what is likely to be the final earnings report from the Swiss lender after its merger with rival UBS Group AG ($UBSG).  The bank called the outflows "significant," adding that they have moderated but not yet reversed.  It said that withdrawals of cash deposits and non-renewal of maturing time deposits were most acute in the days preceding and following the announcement of the tie-up last month. Swiss officials brokered the deal to bolster confidence in the country's banking system in the wake of turmoil across the global financial services sector sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.  Customer deposits also declined by CHF 67B in the opening three months of its 2023 fiscal year.  The results, which analysts at KBW called "alarming," set the stage for quarterly figures from UBS due out tomorrow, with investors keen to find out more about how it plans to fold Credit Suisse into its operations.  "UBS undoubtedly faces a major (and urgent) task in deeply restructuring its former competitor," analysts at Vontobel said in a note on Monday.  **3. NBCUniversal CEO to step down**  NBCUniversal chief Jeff Shell will leave following an investigation reportedly led by an outside counsel into a complaint over inappropriate behavior, the media giant's parent Comcast Corp. ($CMCSA) announced in a note to staff.  In a statement, Shell said he had had an "inappropriate relationship" with a female employee. The woman is believed to be a long-time journalist for the company, according to multiple media reports.  "Today is my last day as CEO of NBCUniversal," Shell said on Sunday. The executive, who is married, added that he deeply regretted the relationship.  Shell's departure comes as a precarious time for NBCUniversal. He had been leading a charge to refocus on the firm's operations as it faced increased competition from streaming rivals.  Senior leaders who had been working under Shell will now report to Comcast president Mike Cavanagh, the note said.  **4. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond files for bankruptcy**  U.S. home goods retailer Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. ($BBBY) has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a New Jersey court after it failed to secure funds needed to continue as a going concern.  The embattled business had attempted to stay afloat through a complex sale of preferred stock and warrants that aimed to raise $1B. However, that deal was scrapped last month, leading the company to announce a last-ditch effort to garner $300 million from investors.  But neither this fundraising drive nor a series of store closures have proven to be enough. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is now expected to use the bankruptcy proceedings to give it time to conduct a liquidation of some or most of its assets. Individual shareholders will likely be wiped out in the process.  Should a bidder for the business come forward, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond said it would pursue a sale and move away from liquidation.  The retail chain, which was once a hugely popular staple of suburban American life, had previously tried to overhaul its operations to combat flagging demand for its privately branded products. This push ultimately proved unfruitful with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond posting a loss of about $393M and a 33% fall in sales in the quarter ended on November 26.  **5. Oil slips amid broader economic fears**  Oil prices dropped, extending their recent decline into this week, as traders eyed a darkening outlook for global demand.  Concerns remain that rising interest rates will lead to a broader economic slowdown, particularly in the U.S. economy, the world's biggest consumer of crude.  By 04:17 EST (08:17 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.51% lower at $77.47 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell by 0.56% to $81.00 per barrel.  Last week, crude markets slumped to their first weekly loss in five, after data showed that the U.S. implied gasoline demand dropped by 3.9% compared to the same period last year.,;,; 2023-04-25 09:35:25]

InnerScope reported consolidated net revenues of $15,284,327, with a net profit of $5,575,892 and a positive EBITA (Earnings Before Taxes) of 36% for the 2022 Full-Year.  &amp;#x200B;  InnerScope's annual financial report has been filed with the OTC Markets and is available to view at:  [https://www.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/363918/content](https://www.otcmarkets.com/otcapi/company/financial-report/363918/content)  &amp;#x200B;  Full-Year 2022 Financial Result Highlights  &amp;#x200B;  Consolidated Net Revenues of $15,284,327 were largely driven by wholesale distribution agreements from InnerScope's acquisitions of Hearing Assist II Inc. ("HearingAssist") and iHear Medical Inc. ("iHEAR") in late 2021. HearingAssist was Walmart's largest supplier of hearing aids online and in selected stores, and iHEAR has a team of electrical and biomedical engineers, hearing aid-related patents, and wholesale partners.  &amp;#x200B;  Gross Profit of $9,079,335 is from an increase in gross margin with suppliers from a substantially increased number of hearing aids sold, which resulted in providing better technology at a lower price.  &amp;#x200B;  Profit from Operations of $909,135 is from a substantial increase in the number of hearing aids sold.  &amp;#x200B;  Net Profit of $5,575,892 is primarily from the gain on debt extinguishment and derivative liability.  &amp;#x200B;  Positive EBITA of 36%  &amp;#x200B;  "This profitable year-end 2022 shows we are on the right path continuing to scale and support our growth, especially now with our success with numerous major retailers requesting to sell our products," said Matthew Moore, CEO of InnerScope Hearing Technologies."

The FDA ruling created a new emerging OTC hearing aid market that was a game changer for InnerScope. As a result of the FDA ruling, InnerScope has pivoted from a direct-to-consumer hearing aid company with its business-to-consumer ("B2C") sales model to primarily a business-to-business ("B2B") sales model. InnerScope's pivot to the B2B model has resulted in major growth in developing a wholesale distribution network of major retailers, pharmacy chains, and healthcare service companies (i.e., Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen).  Moreover, InnerScope's B2B sales model allows more focus and resources for retailer marketing and training retailers on delivering a positive buying experience for InnerScope's OTC Hearing Aids at the store level to their customers. In addition, InnerScope provides the retailer's customers with expert help from its internal Hearing Care Professional Customer Service Call Center.  &amp;#x200B;  In the first quarter of 2023, InnerScope continues its B2B growth trajectory by adding another major retailer with the announcement of its HearingAssist Brand on [Target.com](https://Target.com).  InnerScope has also delivered 2000+ Pharmacy Counter Placards with Product Brochures to Cardinal Health to be distributed to its pharmacy network. Additionally, InnerScope has deployed 17 of its newly designed second-generation automated point-of-sale self-administrated Hearing Screening Kiosks to pharmacies, and 98 more are scheduled to be delivered in the next two weeks.  &amp;#x200B;  Currently, InnerScope is shipping products and free-standing product displays to 1700+ locations for one of its major retailers.  &amp;#x200B;  SEC Audit Update  &amp;#x200B;  InnerScope, as previously announced, retained the audit services of CPA firm Kreit &amp; Chiu CPA LLP ("KC Auditors") to perform independent audits of the financials. The KC Auditors are expected to finish the 2021 and 2022 annual financials in Q2 2023. Once the audits 2021 and 2022 annual financial audits are completed, InnerScope intends to file a Form-10 to be upgraded from OTC Alternative Reporting to SEC Reporting status after 60 days from the date of filing.  &amp;#x200B;  As a result of the 2021 annual financial audit, adjustments to the revenue recognition, derivative income, and derivative liability were made, which resulted in a change in net income for 2021 from a Net Loss of $55,213,992 that was previously reported to a Net Income of $3,366. This positive change totaled $55,217,358, partly due to InnerScope's acquisition of HearingAssist and iHEAR that same year.  &amp;#x200B;  About InnerScope Hearing Technologies, Inc. (OTC PINK: INND):  &amp;#x200B;  InnerScope Hearing Technologies Inc. is a manufacturer and distributor of OTC Hearing Aids, Hearing Aid Accessories &amp; Hearing Health-Related Products ("Hearing Products") dedicated to addressing the global demand for affordable hearing solutions. InnerScope's, with its B2B business distribution model offering affordable OTC Hearing Products through major retailers, pharmacy chains, and healthcare service companies, breaks through the barriers that prevent access to effective and affordable hearing solutions.  &amp;#x200B;  In September 2021, InnerScope acquired iHear Medical Inc., a Direct-to-Consumer ("DTC") cloud-based hearing solution provider, which provided access to over 40 patents and an R&amp;D facility, and a team of engineers. In addition, InnerScope, in November 2021, also acquired HearingAssist, an established leader since 2008 in the DTC hearing aid market with a customer base of over 400,000.

[Dell research and valuation,;,; # Executive Summary:  Dell has stable long-term prospects. They are a mature company. If they can tame their balance sheet, they would likely significantly increase their share price through returns to shareholders.  Another possibility is that they try to become private again because Michael Dell only took the company public to finance an acquisition. They are currently trading at a significant margin of safety between 11% (no growth) and 44% (10% growth).  # Introduction:  Dell provides businesses with IT solutions, ranging from traditional infrastructure, cloud infrastructure, hardware, and software. They also provide consultant-like solutions such as management and migratory support. They also have consumer-oriented businesses that offer off the shelf and custom to order PC‚Äôs. About half of their revenue is generated in the Americas. They have made a number of large acquisitions, notably EMC (cloud infrastructure/solutions), SecureWorks (IT security), and Virtuestream(Cloud ops). They have operations in 180 countries.  The business is organized into two operating segments, Infrastructure Solutions Group, and Client Solutions Group.  |Group|Client Solutions Group|Infrastructure Solutions Group| |:-|:-|:-| |Common functions|Branded hardware, peripherals, third party software support/deployment/configuration, warranties, customer service, financing, build to order.|Cloud Support, Cloud Services(Cloud Ops), Digital transformation&amp; related services, Multi Cloud integration, Cloud native workload solutions.| |General Description|This includes their PC segment and legacy build to order hardware solutions.¬†Through agreements, they also provide services related to third party software, mostly with integral software on their branded devices.|Offer cloud services, and support businesses adopting cloud services, retain them as customers after, provides reliable recurring revenue.¬†Competes with AWS/Azure Enterprise services as well as infrastructure support providers, oriented towards large enterprise.|  # History:  Dell was founded by Michael Dell in 1984. They produce cell phones, computers, other hardware, and software, but used to do ‚Äúbuild to order‚Äù enterprise infrastructure, which was especially popular in the internet bubble. Its two divisions are Dell client solutions group (CSG), and Dell infrastructure solutions group (EMC). Dell acquired EMC in 2015 for $67 billion, diversifying into the enterprise software and store industry. They bought Alienware in 2006. The company has traditionally been involved in the enterprise hardware business, specifically developing custom infrastructure. They have a focus on high performance PC‚Äôs and custom PC‚Äôs. If anything can be taken from their corporate history, it is that the company is not afraid to take dramatic actions to save its skin.  By the late 2000‚Äôs the company could not turn profits in the ‚Äúmake to order‚Äù business. They decided to shift towards off the shelf consumer and enterprise solutions. They were taken private in 2013 and went public again in 2018. VMWare was owned by EMC, and thus came under the control of Dell. Dell has decided to spin off VMWare, and there is a pending acquisition by Broadcom. The VMWare spinoff was completed in 2021. Michael Dell has been chairman since 1984, and apart from 2004-2007, has been CEO of the company. Kevin Rollins was CEO between 2004-2007, but Michael Dell decided to replace him after 5 quarters of disappointing results.  ## Understanding Dell‚Äôs business segments:  Dell is organized into two segments. They are the Client Solutions Group and the Infrastructure Solutions Group.  ISG brought in $34 billion last year with $3.7 billion operating income. It accounts for 34% of their business. If we assume that this is mostly attributed to the EMC purchase, we can draw conclusions about the rational of the purchase by looking at current operating results. The return on investment is underwhelming but considering that Dell is in a mature stage of growth, it is positive that such a large investment will, at this rate, pay off in less than 20 years. At the current rate, it appears dell is looking at a long-term horizon of 18-20 years where EMC will have to prove its worth. It is hard to tell, but it is likely that Dell only went public for the second time to aid in the EMC acquisition.  |Year|Operating Income|ROI| |:-|:-|:-| |2020|$4.0B|6%| |2021|$3.7B|5.5%| |2022|$3.7B|5.5%|  ISG accounts for $14.7 billion of goodwill, a substantial amount obtained from the EMC purchase. In the MRQ, ISG brought in more operating income than CSG despite its significantly lower revenue, an attestation to the profitability Dell enjoys from the still lucrative enterprise solutions business.  They have been able to gradually increase revenue from servers and networking due to improvements in the configurations and technology available to customers.  In the server vendor industry, Dell is a significant player, second only to HPE in market share held by a single company. They have the largest market share in OEM storage systems. Dependence on cloud in the modern business drives growth in this segment. ISG capitalizes on hybrid cloud integrations, as well as public cloud support through hardware and software directly for CSP‚Äôs. This is a fast growing and profitable industry, and Dell‚Äôs positions as an infrastructure provider creates a barrier to exit for existing clients who integrate their infrastructure with Dell.  CSG brought in the majority of revenue at $61 billion, however it cannot attain the same level of profitability, netting $4.3 billion, still a substantial profit margin. They have $4.2 billion in goodwill. Dell ships the third most PC‚Äôs out of all vendors and has been able to keep their market share steady over the past decade. They are consistently able to raise prices in CSG, however they are subject to upstream price pressures, which would see margins significantly decrease in cool economic environments.  In CSG, there is significant competition among many market participants who are deeply entrenched in the industry. No single company has anything close to a majority. CSG is heavily exposed to international markets, especially Taiwan and China, however they have no supply chain exposure to Russia and Ukraine, and Russian/Ukrainian operations account for less than 1% of revenue.  # Segment industry comparison:  The industry average for PC vendors is an 18% average profit margin, well above the 7% Dell has in CSG, which is indicative of the price it pays for scale. They would have trouble improving this value to industry standards without relinquishing their 16.5% market share for a much smaller share, a clear indication of the competitiveness of this industry.  The industry average for cloud/cloud infrastructure providers is less than two percent. This number is slightly misleading, because seasoned providers like Dell, Azure, HPE, and Amazon are grouped together with Startup cloud companies. Among larger, more seasoned cloud infrastructure providers, average profit margins are closer to 14%. ISG‚Äôs profit margin is 11%.  # Financial performance:  The financial data only goes back to 2015, however we can look at the figures for Dell EMC from which the financial history for ISG can be inferred.  Dell EMC‚Äôs revenue only decreased 5.7% in 2009 but increased by 13.3% in 2010. Their revenue decreased 39% between 2000 and 2002. An implosion similar to the internet bubble would likely produce similar results over the short term, but this should be taken as a floor for shrinkage unless there is some five-sigma event that wreaks havoc in the industry. Profit decreased almost 60% in the same period. If the company has a shaky balance sheet, midterm decreases of 50% can threaten their existence. Given how the company has weathered previous economic downturns and depending on the widespread tech exposure to the economic trends, the company could see losses between 6%-40% in a recession but would not be threatened on the basis of their liquidity in CSG.  Revenue has been exceptional in the past two years. The revenue CAGR is about 12%. Net income was negative before 2019 but has been slightly positive since then.  The company has been teetering around zero equity. As of March second, 2023 (most recent financials), they had liabilities exceeding assets by about $3.03 billion, which is down from minus $1.5 billion the year before. They have a significant cash position of $8.6 billion. Their debt structure is very manageable and spread out over the next 20 years. They have an average of $1 billion a year due except for $4.5 billion due in 2026. 24% of their assets are goodwill, which is not unreasonable for the cash flow it can expect from enterprise clients in the future. If they can control their balance sheet, it would be viable for them to buy back shares. Michael Dell does not like relinquishing control of his company, so this may become reality in the future and he could take the company private.  The quarterly and annual results for 2022 indicate there are hard times to come. They averaged a 2.4% profit margin. Operating cash flows decreased over 60% YoY. Despite this, there has been solid growth in operating cash flows in the past decade due to favorable business conditions, and real growth in a mature client base. The operating cash flows will return when economic conditions ease. Capex has increased with opex, which is mostly attributable to the ISG segment maintenance and expansion.  # Valuation:  In projecting the FCF, we should have two sections, one for the next three years resembling the most recent downturn in financial results, and then for the remainder, returning to more normal financial conditions. We will go with a long-term growth rate equal to their growth in a zero rate environment (12.25%) minus the long term target rate of 2%, discounted by the company cost of capital (10%) plus a long term average risk free rate of 5%. Time horizon of 10 years. With this DCF, we arrive at an **intrinsic value of $38.89 billion**. They have a strong ability to generate cash, and do not have prohibitively high capex. Even with no growth, as long as they can hold their cash flows and keep interest and capex down, they would still be valued at $30 billion. However, there could be significant impairments on the company‚Äôs ability to generate cash and raise debt if they cannot get their balance sheet under control.,;,; 2023-03-13 01:34:55]
