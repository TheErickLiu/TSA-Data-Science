[Nvidia is now a national security risk.,;,; With a market cap of 1.7 T nvidia has put itself in an unusual position. It has about 50 buildings world wide and outsourced it manufacturing. TSMC and the Chinese produce the physical chips.  Thing is, if something was to happen to a manufacturing plant, natural or terroristic because the supply chain and how little redundant manufacturing they have. Any hiccup would cause a catastrophic downward spiral. They don't need more cash and that's what an insurance payout would give.  They need a rock solid supply chain.  The real problem is to many institutions, 401k, and life savings are heavily propped up by nvidia. This makes it a national security threat.  A sell off of this magnitude or even correction is going to devastate our economy.  I personally believe they need to rethink and move their manufacturing to the USA. Their margins are high enough to cover the labor cost, and it is in the instrest of the USA for them to do so.   I personally sold my nvida positions and calling it a day. Option spreads are ridiculous, and I feel like after listening to jpowl I want to buy puts on US economy. I do still hold position in amd and tsm...but yea...

[Do you believe in Nvidia in the long term?,;,; So Nvidia +7% today because Morgan Stanley thinks Nvidia is their top pick.  Rating: Overweight   Price Target: $500 ($437 today)  I agree with Morgan Stanley that I don't see demand will drop anytime soon considering all the AI startups are booming and some of them are actually useful (i.e. Midjourney).  But I also feel that Nvidia has gone up too much in 2023 for a trillion dollar company.  Nvidia earnings are coming up on Aug 23, what are your thoughts?  FYI, the following are some of the quotes from Morgan Stanley's notes:  * "Nvidia remains our Top Pick, with a backdrop of the massive shift in spending towards AI, and a fairly exceptional supply demand imbalance that should persist for the next several quarters.‚Äù * Demand is High       * ‚ÄúWe expect NVDA‚Äôs Data Center business to drive much of the growth over the next 5 years, as enthusiasm for generative AI has created a strong environment for AI/ML hardware solutions‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäNVDA‚Äôs being one of the most important.

[Everyone says NVIDIA is overrated,;,;   The thing is, why would one sell NVIDIA? The company is currently growing at an unprecedented rate and simply dominates the AI market. I believe NVIDIA has been a successful investment in the past because its stock has consistently risen. So, why shouldn't it continue? Every minor dip attracts buyers, and everyone thinks the stock will keep rising, given its historical performance. There's really no reason to sell the stock, either because you believe in the company‚ÄîI certainly do, given that they produce the world's best graphics cards and now lead in AI chips‚Äîor because you want to capitalize on the strong AI boom, which NVIDIA is benefiting from immensely.  Hence, it's challenging to argue that the stock is overvalued. NVIDIA has undergone five stock splits in the past due to consistently high prices, and history might repeat itself. There's no reason why it shouldn't reach the $1,000 mark or even surpass it. If the quarterly reports continue to be fantastic, I'm convinced the stock will hold its ground. The only thing that could weaken the market is if something world-changing happens, such as a chip shortage or political sanctions, whatever it may be.  Or can you tell me why there's constantly talk about the stock being overvalued? Granted, the current price has surged due to the AI boom, everyone is buying into NVIDIA according to various reports. But who says the price isn't justified? And even if it is, I don't expect a significant correction unless the earnings calls turn out poorly, which is not believed to be the case so far.,;,; 2024-02-03 22:48:34]

You need nvidia to make your AI model.   You need nvidia to run your AI model.  You need nvidia to run someone else‚Äôs AI model.   Literally any time you see a company mention generative AI, which is gonna be every single company, they‚Äôre basically announcing to the world they are giving nvidia money.   There is not a single nvidia AI chip available right now. They are all accounted for next two years.   This is based on current perception.  There‚Äôs something very important in AI that you need to remember and that is how when models get larger, they have demonstrated learning abilities that the developers did not specifically teach.  The potential for winner take all outcome is ENORMOUS with AI. FANG is fighting for their lives right now. It is not just google.  If you are concerned about china ban, know that china is only 20% of nvidia revenue, and there is no way China won‚Äôt try to smuggle this earth changing tech at higher prices. /s Those future chips are already sold.  If you are concerned about insider sales, remember that Moderna insiders also sold all the way up, many too early.  Just like moderna, nvidia boldly gambled on an unproven technology and the world is primed.   But nvidia is not moderna. There is no demand cliff coming.

[Nvidia $25 billion buyback 'a head-scratcher' for some shareholders.,;,; Nvidia's move to repurchase $25 billion in stock after the company's price more than tripled this year caught some investors off guard. Following the company's quarterly revenue projection, which was fuelled by an artificial-intelligence boom, shares reached a record high on Thursday. Nvidia stock rose more than 6% on Thursday, but then fell back to close the day barely changed. However, Nvidia's stock repurchase announcement, the fifth-largest among U.S.-based businesses this year, startled some investors.   Companies usually repurchase stock to return capital to owners, which can help a company's price by lowering supply and raising demand, as well as increase earnings per share. However, Nvidia's stock has increased by over 220% in 2023, leaving investors wondering what is driving the company's decision.   For some investors, a "undervalued" Nvidia may be a difficult statement to swallow. As of Wednesday, Nvidia shares were trading at 45 times ahead 12-month profit forecasts, compared to approximately 19 times for the S\&amp;amp;P 500. Tom Plumb, CEO and lead portfolio manager at Plumb Funds, which has Nvidia as one of its major holdings, believes the company may be limited in how it can deploy its resources after its deal to buy chip designer Arm Holdings Ltd fell through last year owing to regulatory worries.   Last year, Nvidia spent roughly 27% of its revenue on research and development, in line with competing chip firms. A request for comment was not immediately returned by the corporation. Nvidia stated in its second-quarter results announcement that its board of directors approved $25 billion in additional share repurchases "without expiration," and that the firm intends to continue repurchases this fiscal year.   Despite the astonishing monetary figure, Nvidia's buyback represented only 2.1% of its over $1.2 trillion market value as of Wednesday, or a buyback yield of 2.1%. Tech businesses prefer to use cash for buybacks rather than dividends since they may be obligated to pay a dividend every quarter, limiting their freedom to capitalize on growth possibilities.,;,; 2023-08-25 11:31:17]

[NVIDIA will cross 2,000$,;,; NVIDIA is going to cross 2,000$  Listen up regards, today lord Sam 7 trillion Altman of OpenAI released an AI model to send YouTube creators out of business. (Link : https://openai.com/sora) Ok, YouTubers will soon run out of Tendies, how does this mean NVIDIA will reach 2000$ you ask?   Well to see the connection you need to understand a bit of AI. There are 2 big models that currently exist: Transformers and Diffusion. The thing about transformers is that they operate on tokens. For language a bunch of letters together form a token. ‚Äúab‚Äù can be 1 token, ‚Äúcan‚Äù another token and so on. Basically they do not think in terms of single alphabets but actually think in terms of tokens. So OpenAI took 100 million Microsoft bucks, 1 billion+ NVIDIA GPU‚Äôs and created ChatGPT that started this AI bull run.   Then came the question how to apply this technique to images. Naively each image generates far more tokens than a thousand word essay and so understanding an image seems extremely inefficient. Transformers will not work, smooth brained critics said. Then Sam Altman pulled the infinite money Microsoft glitch and OpenAI trained a massively large transformer on an ungodly number of GPUs and showed we could perfectly understand images with GPT-4.   ‚ÄúWell ok maybe images work, but this will never work for videos, that would require an insane amount of compute‚Äù, smooth brained critics said. It turns out these critics just lacked imagination since Sam Altman proceeded to ask for 7 trillion dollars, more than the GDP of every country except US and China to throw more compute at AI. So when OpenAI says they will just brute force AI, throw trillions of compute at it and achieve AGI you better believe them. They have now come out with a transformer based Video Diffusion model. They never mentioned how big this model is, but it is probably bigger than GPT-4 . GPT-5 which is rumored to be able to understand and answer questions on video, is probably one order of magnitude bigger than GPT-4 and might cost 1 billion + to train. This means the market is still significantly underestimating the demand for NVIDIA chips and NVIDIAs price target should be 2000$ + in coming future.  TLDR; OpenAI‚Äôs foray into video using transformers shows there is far more compute they can use to generate even better AI‚Äôs. They will probably buy 10X the compute they already bought, from NVIDIA in the coming years in their quest to build AI. NVIDIA will skyrocket as a result.,;,; 2024-02-15 22:12:18]

[üöÄüöÄ GETY + NVIDIA = MOON! Why Getty Images is the Next Tendie Factory üöÄüöÄ,;,; What's up you degenerate apes? ü¶ç Listen up, because I've got a hot take that could be your ticket to Tendie Town. I'm talking about Getty Images (GETY), the company that's been hoarding every photo you've ever seen like a dragon sitting on a pile of gold. üêâüí∞  ### Why Getty?  1. **Monopoly Money**: These guys practically have a monopoly on stock photos. You need a pic of a sad businessman staring at a sandwich? Getty's got you. A happy family eating salad? Getty. They've got it all, and they're charging through the nose for it. 2. **Diversification**: They're not just about photos anymore. They've got videos, music, and even digital art. It's like they're building the Infinity Gauntlet of digital media. 3. **Subscription Model**: They've got a subscription service that's stickier than the floor at a movie theater. Once companies get in, they can't get out. Recurring revenue, baby! 4. **NVIDIA Partnership**: Hold onto your butts, because Getty just announced a partnership with NVIDIA to release a generative AI program. As we all know, NVIDIA is a WSB darling, and this partnership could send both stocks to the moon! üåï  ### The Numbers üìà  I can't give you real-time numbers because I'm not a wizard, but let's just say their revenue has been growing like a weed, and they're more profitable than a casino in Vegas.  ### The Play üé≤  * **Long Calls**: If you're a true WSB degenerate, you're already thinking about YOLOing some long calls. Just remember, options are risky, and you could lose it all. * **Stock**: If you're a boomer or just risk-averse, buying the stock outright isn't a bad play either. * **Short Puts**: If you're bullish but want to collect some premium, consider selling some puts. Just make sure you're ready to own the stock if it dips.  ### Risks üìâ  1. **Regulation**: If governments start cracking down on copyright laws or something, Getty could take a hit. 2. **Competition**: There's always a risk that some startup could come in and disrupt the market. But let's be real, Getty is the 800-pound gorilla in the room. 3. **Market Conditions**: We're in a volatile market, so anything could happen. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.  Alright, you smooth-brained animals, that's my DD. Do your own research, and let's ride this rocket to the moon! üöÄüöÄ  **Disclaimer**: This is not financial advice. I'm just a random internet person. Always do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.,;,; 2023-09-29 16:25:02]
[Nvidia chases $30 billion custom chip market with new unit,;,; Nvidia NVDA  is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for  cloud computing firms and others, including advanced artificial  intelligence processors, according to nine sources familiar with the  company's plans.  The dominant global designer and  supplier of AI chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market  for custom AI chips and to protect itself from the growing number of  companies interested in finding alternatives to its products.  The  Santa Clara, California-based company currently controls about 80% of  the market for high-end AI chips, a position that has sent its market  value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than  tripled in 2023.  Its customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOG and Meta Platforms META, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of Nvidia chips to compete in the rapidly emerging generative AI sector.  Nvidia's  H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor  for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started  to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps  reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time  to design.  Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in  helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to  rival firms such as Broadcom AVGO and Marvell Technology MRVL, according to the sources who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  "If  you're really trying to optimize on things like power, or optimize on  cost for your application, you can't afford to go drop an H100 or A100  in there," Greg Reichow, general partner at venture capital firm Eclipse  Ventures said in an interview. "You want to have the exact right  mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need."  Nvidia does not disclose H100 prices, which are higher than for the  prior-generation A100, but each chip can sell from $16,000 to $100,000  depending on the volume purchased and other factors. Meta has said it  plans to bring its total stock to 350,000 H100s this year.  Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon .com AMZN,  Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for  them, according to two sources familiar with the meetings. Beyond data  center chips, the company has pursued telecom, automotive and video game  customers.  In 2022, Nvidia said it would let  third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking  technology with their own chips. The company has said nothing about the  program since, and Reuters is reporting its wider ambitions for the  first time.  A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company's 2022 announcement.  Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices AMD  and Marvell executive, heads Nvidia's custom unit and her team's goal  is to make its technology available for customers in cloud, 5G wireless,  video games and automotives, according to a LinkedIn profile. Those  mentions were scrubbed and her title was changed after Reuters sought  comment from Nvidia.  Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment.  $30 BILLION MARKET  According  to estimates from research firm 650 Group‚Äôs Alan Weckel, the data  center custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year,  and double that in 2025.  The broader custom chip market  was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023, which amounts to roughly 5% of  annual global chip sales, according to Needham analyst Charles Shi.  Currently, custom silicon design for data centers is dominated by Broadcom and Marvell.  In  a typical arrangement, a design partner such as Nvidia would offer  intellectual property and technology, but leave the chip fabrication,  packaging and additional steps to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  2330 or another contract chip manufacturer.  Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales.  "With  Broadcom's custom silicon business touching $10 billion, and Marvell‚Äôs  around $2 billion, this is a real threat," said Dylan Patel, founder of  the silicon research group SemiAnalysis. "It's a real big negative -  there's more competition entering the fray."  BEYOND AI  Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson 61QS  for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics  processing unit (GPU) technology, according to two sources familiar with  the talks.  650 Group's Weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year.  Ericsson declined to comment.  Nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video game markets, according to sources and public social media postings.  Weckel  expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6  billion to $8 billion range at 20% a year, and the $7 billion to $8  billion video game custom chip market could increase with the  next-generation consoles from Xbox and Sony 6857.  Nintendo‚Äôs  current Switch handheld console already includes an Nvidia chip, the  Tegra X1. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is  likely to include a Nvidia custom design, according to one source.  Nintendo declined to comment.  &amp;#x200B;  \- Reuters,;,; 2024-02-09 13:25:56]

[Nvidia stock breaks out, flashing bullish sign, with earnings due ‚Äî Is it a buy?,;,; Nvidia ($NVDA), a data center and gaming behemoth, remains hot. The chipmaker is often regarded as one of the greatest beneficiaries of the AI revolution. Is Nvidia stock a buy after breaking over a critical level on Monday, with earnings anticipated later this week?  Nvidia is scheduled to disclose its fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, following a quarter of stellar performance and outsized AI-driven guidance. Analysts at KeyBanc, HSBC, and Baird have boosted their price targets on Nvidia stock, joining over ten other Wall Street firms in doing so in the last week. Wall Street is looking to Nvidia's guidance for 2023 and 2024 to determine the underlying demand and growth direction of AI spending. Nvidia revealed its next-generation AI super processor, the GH200, in August, with the goal of targeting the expanding generative AI sector.  https://preview.redd.it/29fls97fqmjb1.png?width=802&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65dbb63bb7176bbd921f465bb6bed48b1708cd41  Despite the stock market's "in correction" position, Nvidia has outperformed growth equities in general. On August 21, the relative strength line reached a new high, and Nvidia joined the renowned IBD Leaderboard in February due to an earnings gap-up. Nvidia stock has risen more than 221% year to far, reaching a 52-week high on July 14. Nvidia receives an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of a maximum of 99, putting it in the top 4% of all companies in terms of technical and fundamental indicators. Investors should prioritize stocks with Comp Ratings of 90 or above.  Nvidia, situated in Santa Clara, California, has issued a bullish, AI-fueled sales projection for the first quarter, earning $1.09 per share on sales of $7.19 billion. Despite a 20% year-on-year reduction in profitability and a 13% drop in revenue, the company's results exceeded Wall Street's forecasts. Sales of data centers increased 14% to $4.28 billion, while sales of gaming chips decreased 38% to $2.24 billion. Analysts now predict that Nvidia's earnings will increase 148% this year, while sales will increase 65%. Nvidia's history includes developing graphics processing units (GPUs) to improve the realism of video games, extending into AI chips used in supercomputers, data centers, and medication discovery, and working on "supercomputers" that combine its own CPUs and GPUs. Nvidia chips are also employed in cryptocurrency mining and self-driving electric vehicles. The fabless category is ranked 21st out of 197 industry groups, with competitors such as QCOM, Broadcom, and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR).  ## Is Nvidia Stock A Buy?  Because of brisk chip sales for data centers and artificial intelligence, Nvidia's earnings are likely to more than double this fiscal year. The business is moving into automated electric vehicles and cloud gaming, and the adoption of the metaverse and cryptocurrencies might increase demand for Nvidia chips even further. However, macroeconomic uncertainty and the potential of a worldwide recession continue to exist. Nvidia stock has nearly tripled by 2023, but the AI chip leader's earnings later this week, as well as overall market conditions, should be taken into account before making any fresh investments.

[Nvidia Earnings Strategy: Hedging for All Outcomes,;,; Yesterday was the final Friday before NVDA's earnings report.  Honestly, I don't even want to speculate about how it'll turn out. What I do know is that, [regardless of the outcome](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/15t11yg/red_pill_and_blue_pill_which_one_do_you_choose/), I'll have an edge against both those betting on the continuation of the AI rally and those anticipating a bubble burst.  I've set up a win-win strategy. I bought 8 09/15 Calls at $475 and sold a few 08/25 Calls for a certain price.  If NVDA does climb post-report, which I find doubtful, I'll profit from the calls I've purchased. Of course, I've hedged against the opposite scenario, which I believe is more likely ‚Äì NVDA dropping below $400. For that, I've secured 2 ratio-spreads (1:3) from $375 to $300.  All in all, I ended up with a credit of $4376 on an allocated $50k for this strategy. Normally, I'd allocate around $30k, but I made an exception for NVDA.  https://preview.redd.it/eq8fpzzl83jb1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=af41986fb63abdf0131b42a294c1e51a5d3e7083,;,; 2023-08-19 15:48:05]

[Chinese military, universities still buying Nvidia chips despite U.S. ban - report,;,; Chinese military entities, public universities and research institutes over the past year have bought Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) semiconductors that the U.S. banned from exporting to China, Reuters reported citing tender documents.  Chips that were purchased include Nvidia's (NVDA) A100, H100, A800 and H800 chips, whose exports to China were banned by the U.S.  The buyers include the state-run Harbin Institute of Technology and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, both of which allegedly have military ties.  Other buyers include Tsinghua University, a laboratory run by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, as well as an unnamed People's Liberation Army entity.  While the tenders show that most of the chips are being used for AI, the number of chips bought so far are too small to build an AI large language model from scratch.  The suppliers mentioned in the tenders do not include Nvidia (NVDA) or retailers approved by the company. "If we learn that a customer has made an unlawful resale to third parties, we'll take immediate and appropriate action," an Nvidia (NVDA) spokesperson said.  The sales shed light on Washington's challenges in cutting off China's access to high-end chips that can advance AI development amid national security concerns. The U.S. is working to close all loopholes in chip export controls, with plans to add more restrictions as needed yet China are still managing to buy Nvidia chips through third parties and countries regardless of the restrictions added and being in place.   üöÄüöÄüöÄ $NVDA TO $700 END OF MONTH üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ   This is my comment below since some people are misunderstanding  &gt; Though it‚Äôs not Nvidia doing it, not the company, it‚Äôs the people who are buying and reselling from countries which are not USA.

[Is Nvidia Overvalued? AVGO Boasts 62% Higher Net Income than NVDA, Yet with a 65% Lower Market Cap?,;,; In the rapidly evolving world of technology, NVIDIA has emerged as a leading player in the semiconductor industry. Known for its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the company has garnered significant attention from investors. However, in the current economic environment, there are growing concerns that NVIDIA‚Äôs stock may be overvalued. This article delves into various factors, including economic indicators, company fundamentals and comparable examples , to provide a comprehensive analysis of why NVIDIA‚Äôs stock valuation may be inflated.   As a cyclical stock, the global economy plays a crucial role in determining the performance and valuation of a company like NVIDIA. Considering economic indicators such as GDP growth rates showing signs of moderation, reflecting a potential slowdown in overall economic activity. Additionally, inflationary pressures and interest rate adjustments have introduced uncertainties into the market. These factors can impact investor sentiment and the valuation of companies, including NVIDIA.  To evaluate NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation, we need to examine its fundamental aspects. The company‚Äôs financial profile reveals key information:  Examining NVIDIA‚Äôs quarterly income statement reveals a mix of sales growth and decline over the past five quarters. The most recent quarter, ending on April 30, 2023, saw a substantial increase in sales with a growth rate of 18.86%. However, the preceding quarters experienced more varied results, including modest growth, a decline, and a significant drop in sales.  These fluctuations in sales growth suggest that NVIDIA‚Äôs revenue stream may not be consistently expanding. Such volatility can impact the company‚Äôs overall valuation, especially when combined with the high P/E ratio of 219.84 mentioned earlier. Investors should be cautious when evaluating the stock‚Äôs current valuation, considering the mixed performance shown in the income statement.  	1.	Market Capitalization: NVIDIA‚Äôs market cap stands at a staggering $1.04 trillion, highlighting its prominence in the market. However, a high market cap alone does not guarantee that a stock is fairly valued. 	2.	Earnings Per Share (EPS): NVIDIA‚Äôs EPS for the most recent fiscal year was reported at $1.92. While this figure appears solid, a deeper analysis is necessary to assess its significance in relation to the stock‚Äôs valuation. 	3.	Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: The P/E ratio for NVIDIA is an eye-opening 219.84, indicating a substantial premium investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. A high P/E ratio could suggest overvaluation if not adequately supported by other factors.  To assess NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation further, it is prudent to compare the company‚Äôs financial indicators to those of its competitors within the semiconductor sector, namely AMD, Micron, and AVGO.  AMD, with an EPS of 0.24 and a market capitalization of $183.44 billion, exhibits a notably lower valuation compared to NVIDIA. However, the semiconductor industry‚Äôs current fame and widespread recognition may contribute to inflated valuations across the sector.  Micron‚Äôs negative EPS of -2.68 and market capitalization of $69.12 billion indicate weaker financial performance when compared to NVIDIA and AMD. As a result, Micron may not serve as an accurate benchmark for evaluating NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation.  AVGO, another prominent player in the semiconductor sector, boasts a healthy EPS of 31.64 and a P/E ratio of 27.41. With a market capitalization of $357.98 billion, AVGO appears to be favorably valued relative to its earnings, further highlighting the need for careful evaluation within the semiconductor sector.  Comparing AVGO‚Äôs Annual Income Statement with NVDA‚Äôs provides valuable insights into the financial performance of both companies:  AVGO Annual Income Statement:  	‚Ä¢	2022 Sales/Revenue: $33,203 million 	‚Ä¢	2022 Net Income: $11,495 million  NVDA Annual Income Statement:  	‚Ä¢	2023 Sales/Revenue: $26,974 million 	‚Ä¢	2023 Net Income: $4,368 million  Looking at the revenue figures, AVGO has consistently shown higher sales/revenue over the past five years. In 2022, AVGO reported sales of $33,203 million, while NVDA reported sales of $26,974 million.  In terms of net income, AVGO has also demonstrated strong performance. In 2022, AVGO reported a net income of $11,495 million, indicating robust profitability. On the other hand, NVDA reported a net income of $4,368 million in 2023, which is notably lower than AVGO‚Äôs net income.  These figures suggest that AVGO has consistently outperformed NVDA in terms of both revenue and net income. The higher revenue and stronger profitability of AVGO further reinforce the argument that NVIDIA may be overvalued when compared to AVGO.  Taking into account the prevailing economic challenges and the potential impact on the semiconductor sector, there are indications that NVIDIA‚Äôs current valuation may be inflated. The semiconductor industry, including NVIDIA, has gained significant attention due to its critical role in emerging technologies and the ongoing digital revolution. However, widespread recognition and market enthusiasm can contribute to elevated valuations.  Given the factors discussed above, including the mixed sales growth, high P/E ratio, and comparisons to industry peers, there is a compelling case to suggest that NVIDIA‚Äôs stock may experience a sharp price decline in the near future. The current economic environment, with signs of a slowdown in overall economic activity and uncertainties surrounding inflation and interest rates, adds further weight to this analysis.  While the company‚Äôs prominence in the semiconductor industry is undeniable, the potential for overvaluation cannot be overlooked. The market cap of $1.04 trillion alone does not guarantee fair valuation, and the EPS and P/E ratio indicate a premium investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.  While the stock has enjoyed significant attention and growth, there are indications that it is overvalued. In conclusion, it is crucial for investors to assess NVIDIA‚Äôs stock valuation critically, taking into account the economic landscape, company fundamentals, and industry trends.,;,; 2023-07-02 15:43:59]

[Ultimate Nvidia DD (The Best),;,; First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens.      It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark.   No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space.  First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently?  You could say it‚Äôs because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood.   It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT.  AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks.  How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype?   Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it‚Äôs not just any Product. It‚Äôs a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.   An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.  This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).  This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.  They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.  How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else.  Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:  \- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees  \- Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)  \- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)  \- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers  The Analogy:  ‚ÄûPrivate customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).  TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.  The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.  At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.  Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.  Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.  What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.  Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.‚Äú        \----  NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.  Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that‚Äôs their moat. This tells me that the person doesn‚Äôt know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.  NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They ‚Äûonly‚Äú design them.  Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It‚Äôs TSMC.   TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.  So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big ‚ÄûChip Design Company‚Äú. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult ‚Äúmoat‚Äù part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.  There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.  So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.   Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?   This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.  Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.  AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.  Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they‚Äôre building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.  According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.  Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!  Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:  ‚ÄûHowever, in 2010, **Apple** made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple‚Äôs GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.  Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple‚Äôs commitment to developing its own graphics technology.‚Äú ([Does Apple use Nvidia?

Line 2 is the slope which shows the rate that it falls from the top. Copy this slope and apply it to today for line 3. The point where it intersects line 1 is when it stops going down. Draw horizontal line 4 from here and you can see the price is close to 320. Draw vertical line 5 and note that time is close to end of 2023.  The reason it goes down is because all the AI and quantum computers and everything that you can think of is already priced in.

Nvidia publicly released a technology demo called "Chat with RTX." The software is free to download and allows consumers to use open-source AI large-language models ‚Äî including Mistral or Meta Platforms' Llama 2 ‚Äî to interface with their files and documents.  &amp;#x200B;  After a user points "Chat with RTX" to a folder on their computer with .txt, .pdf, and Microsoft Word documents, they can ask the chatbot questions about any information contained in the files.  &amp;#x200B;  "Since Chat with RTX runs locally on Windows RTX PCs and workstations, the provided results are fast ‚Äî and the user's data stays on the device, " Nvidia said. "Rather than relying on cloud-based LLM services, Chat with RTX lets users process sensitive data on a local PC without the need to share it with a third party or have an internet connection."  &amp;#x200B;  Barron's tested "Chat with RTX" over the last few days on an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU.

[Why I Believe Nvidia Will Continue To Grow For The Remainder of 2024,;,; The Santa Clara, California-based company controls about 80% of high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock market value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023.  As of February 13, 2024 Nvidia has a P/E ratio of 95.24 which may seem high and it totally is understandable. Company seems overweight, compared to competitors such as Intel who have or P/E ratio of 107.63 or AMD 326.41. Compared to competitors they are not as over valued.   Lets compare Nvidia with other companies around its market cap. Amazon has a P/E ratio of 58.16. The difference between Amazon and Nvidia is Nvidia is bound for more growth in the near future with the boom of AI which they control the AI chip market by a crazy 80%. What about their financials, last quarter Nvidia had 18.12 Total Revenue with a net income of 9.24 billion. Amazon had 143.08 billion with net income of 9.88 billion. Nvidia has a huge profit margin of 51.01% compared to Amazon's measly  6.9%. No doubt Amazon is trying to create a bigger net profit margin but so would Nvidia.   Recently Canada had signed a letter of intent to engage in business with Nvidia. Recent CEO Huang discussed that not only is Canada prioritizing AI infrastructure but also Japan, France, South Korea, Malaysia, Italy and Britain. This tells us that countries want to buy these chips from producers around the world which Nvidia are currently leading. Only problem is supply chain issues.  With this kind of demand meeting supply is dificult. Hopefully Nvidia is able to capitalize this and meet this enormous demand with increased prices to maximize revenue.  Nvidia is setting foot in creating energy efficient computing for AI. They are making custom chips for clients such as Meta, Amazon, etc... To become more efficient in specific needs for each clients. This opens up multiple new paths for increased revenue. Not just that Nvidia is creating Gpu's for the consumers which compute the power for AI, of course enough power to game and design.  \---**Major current buyers:**  * **Cloud giants:**    * **Meta:** A major spender, reportedly purchasing billions of dollars worth of H100 chips for their Metaverse ambitions and AI development.    * **Microsoft:** Another big investor, aiming to power cloud services and its Azure AI platform with Nvidia's tech.    * **Amazon:** Utilizing Nvidia chips for their AWS cloud services and internal AI endeavors.    * **Google:** While Google develops its own AI chips, they also leverage Nvidia's technology for specific applications. * **Tech companies:**    * **Baidu:** China's tech giant is reportedly a significant buyer, using Nvidia chips for AI research and development.    * **Tencent:** Another Chinese tech player heavily invested in AI, likely utilizing Nvidia's chips for various projects.    * **Alibaba:** Their spending details are less transparent, but they're likely in the mix due to their extensive AI efforts.    * **Dell:** As a major PC and server manufacturer, they incorporate Nvidia GPUs in their offerings, contributing to Nvidia's sales.  \---**Potential future buyers:**  * **Other cloud providers:** Companies like IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud could increasingly turn to Nvidia chips for their AI offerings. * **Startups and smaller companies:** As AI gains traction in various industries, adoption of Nvidia's technology by smaller players is expected to grow. * **Governments:** For projects in areas like national security, healthcare, and research, governments could become significant buyers.  \---**Global reach, with limitations:**  * Nvidia does aim for widespread sales, reaching numerous countries across the globe. They have customers in various regions, including North America, Europe, Asia, and more.  \---**Export controls and restrictions:**  * However, Nvidia needs to adhere to export control regulations set by the US government, where they're headquartered. These regulations might restrict sales to specific countries or for certain uses.  **Examples of restrictions:**  * In October 2023, the US implemented restrictions on selling their most advanced AI chips to China, aiming to prevent their use for military or other sensitive applications. * Similar restrictions might apply to other countries in the future, depending on evolving policies. * Such restrictions can reduce sales but they weren't selling much to China either way. Now they sell chips with slightly less computing power.  **Upcoming potential announcements (based on rumors and speculations):**  * **GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs:** While not officially confirmed, new consumer graphics cards are expected sometime in 2024 or 2025, likely offering further performance boosts for gamers. * **Next-gen DRIVE autonomous vehicle platform:** Nvidia's self-driving technology is constantly evolving, and the next iteration of the DRIVE platform might bring significant advancements. * **New AI chips:** Beyond the recently released H100, Nvidia is likely working on even more powerful and specialized AI chips for various applications.  With the H200 coming second quarter of 2024.  The biggest worries are geopolitical tensions and export restrictions. Do what you will with this info regards.

[Story Time - Nvidia, CoreWeave, Magnetard Capital and the Next Bubble to Pop,;,; Gather round for some Big Short, Margin Call level shit...  The goal of this post isn't to accuse any financial firm or Nvidia of breaking any laws because we all know our existing laws let the big dogs do whatever the fuck they want with zero consequences. It's to start figuring out whether we're really on the precipice of the next AI revolution (probably not given how a cone can stop a Cruise car from moving and Elon's FSD ran a red light on stream), or the next mania induced bubble.  &amp;#x200B;  * 2001 .com bubble * 2008 MBS bubble * 2017 crypto bubble * 2021 SPAC/NFT trash bubble * 2023 AI AI AI AI AI AI AI AI bubble????

They're known within wall street as one of the more deplorable hedge funds to exist. And it makes some sense, as the founder and CEO of Magnetard Capital, Alec Litowitz, comes from a hedge fund we all know and love, Ken Griffin‚Äôs Citadel LLC.  * [The Magnetar Trade: How One Hedge Fund Helped Keep the Bubble Going](https://www.propublica.org/article/all-the-magnetar-trade-how-one-hedge-fund-helped-keep-the-housing-bubble) * [A Fund Behind Astronomical Losses](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120027155742887331)  Fine, but what does this have to do with Nvidia and CoreWeave?  &amp;#x200B;  CoreWeave was originally called **Hudson Ridge Asset Management** and founded in 2012 by three former natural gas futures traders (Enron vibes anyone?) turned crypto bros who renamed their company **The Atlantic Crypto Corporation** in 2017 to capitalize on the burgeoning retail crypto bubble.  After riding that fad into the ground, they pivoted from ETH mining and renamed themselves **CoreWeave** on October 28 2021.  Two weeks after CoreWeave was founded, **Magnetard Capital** invests $50 million into CoreWeave despite the two week old company having no patents, products, or anything of substance. That same day, **Nvidia** announces CoreWeave is now an Nvidia Elite Partner for Compute. Strange.  Nov 2022 - **ChatGPT** becomes the new fad everyone can‚Äôt stop talking about, especially your creepy bald uncle who wants to know if "the AI" can write erotic novellas, hypothetically of course...  Dec 2022 - **CoreWeave** secures another $100 million from **Magnetard Capital.** Again, CoreWeave has no products, patents, or services.  April 2023 - **CoreWeave** gets another $221 million led by **Magnetard Capital** and Nvidia as a secondary investor.  May 2023 - **CoreWeave** secures $200 million in a series B extension, bringing the total **Magnetard Capital** has invested in CoreWeave to nearly half a billion dollars.

[AMD is disrupting Nvidia,;,;    $AMD is set up to take a lot of market share from $NVDA for 2 reasons:  1.Much of of $NVDA ¬¥s moat stems from CUDA, which enables developers to interact with $NVDA GPUs seamlessly when coding.  However, Pytorch has become the dominant framework for deep learning (AI) and now, $AMD GPUs work out of the box on Pytorch.  This opens the veil for $AMD to disrupt $NVDA ¬¥s software moat and levels the playing field.  2. $NVDA ¬¥s chips are monolithic, while $AMD ¬¥s chips are chiplet based. Chiplets have enabled $AMD to disrupt $INTC by yielding high performing but cheap chips.  This is because when you make a chip out of chiplets, if one of the components goes wrong you don¬¥t have to throw the entire thing away. Hence, yields are much higher than in monolithic architectures.  I believe the same is going to happen on the GPU side.  Chiplets have lower margins and so pivoting to this would hurt $NVDA ¬¥s financials: a clear case of the Innovator¬¥s Dilemma. $NVDA has a fantastic business and will hardly find the incentives to disrupt itself moving towards chiplets.  In combination, a democratization of deep learning development tools with $AMD coming into the GPU space with its chiplet capabilities bodes well for $AMD to grow its market share.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/4k603wwf5f7c1.png?width=680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76ea5583a4a30dcca6291eee0c39e3d6147aef0a,;,; 2023-12-20 09:30:12]

[Why it's not so easy for AMD to catch up with Nvidia.,;,;  Over the past few decades, Nvidia has been doing the same with its GPUs as Tesla has been doing with its cars: fostering a retro-compatible architecture, enabled by **software**.  Nvidia‚Äôs CUDA (a software which enables developers to seamlessly interact with Nvidia GPUs) is effectively a network which ties together all of these seemingly disparate hardware units.  Every iteration of the software accrues to an ever larger installed base, which creates an **ecosystem** that draws talent towards it. The more people that use Nvidia GPUs, the more valuable **each** GPU becomes.  Additionally, Nvidia continues to improve its software at breakneck speed. This quarter it released TensorRT-LLM, which allegedly ‚Äòwithout anybody touching anything, improves the performance \[of a GPU\] by a factor of **two**.‚Äô  During the quarter, Nvidia also announced the launch of the latest member of the Hooper family, the **H200**. It increases inference speed by a factor of **two**, with respect to the H100.  Thus, the combination of hardware and software has enabled Nvidia to increase the performance of its GPUs by a factor of **4** in a year. This would‚Äôt be possible without the software.  Additionally, Pandas (the world‚Äôs most popular data science framework) is now accelerated by Nvidia CUDA without a single line of code, thanks to the recently launched **cuDF Pandas**.  Further, in my AMD deep dive, I explain the concept of Gen 4 datacenters and how they are a requirement to bring AI to the world at scale. By becoming an indispensable part of these datacenters at the **networking** level, semiconductor companies can gain an **additional moat**.  Gen 4 are essentially **stateful**, meaning that they hold data about their state at all times and can use it to train AI models, so the datacenter gains **autonomy**.  For a datacenter to be stateful, it has to move data around the place **very efficiently**.  Nvidia‚Äôs acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 enabled it to onboard **two key technologies**:  1. **The BlueField** **DPU:** a data processing unit (DPU) is a specialized processor designed to offload networking, storage, and security tasks from general-purpose CPUs, that enables datacenters to **hold** information about themselves. 2. **Infiniband**: a high-performance networking technology that provides ultra-low latency, high bandwidth, and scalable **connectivity for data centers**. It is a key enabler for high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI), and other demanding workloads that require **fast and efficient data transfer**.  While AMD is pursuing a similar roadmap with the acquisition of Pensando, I see no particular progress made on this front.  On the other hand, Nvidia‚Äôs networking business now exceeds a $10 billion annualized revenue run rate, ‚Äòdriven by exceptional demand for InfiniBand, which grew **fivefold** year-on-year.‚Äô,;,; 2023-12-24 10:42:19]

[Nvidia surpasses Amazon in market value.,;,; Good morning, everyone.  So, here's the scoop: Nvidia, the tech giant, recently surpassed Amazon in terms of market value. They reached a staggering peak of $1.82 trillion, while Amazon trailed slightly behind at $1.81 trillion. This sudden surge in Nvidia's value is mainly attributed to its remarkable performance in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).  Now, let's break it down a bit further. Nvidia's dominance in the AI sector has been gaining traction for a while now. Their innovative technologies and solutions have been making waves, capturing the attention of investors and industry experts alike. This recent milestone, though brief, serves as a clear indication of Nvidia's growing prominence in the technology market.  In essence, Nvidia's rise to the top spot, even if temporary, showcases their significant impact and potential in shaping the future of AI and technology as a whole. Keep an eye on Nvidia; they're definitely ones to watch!,;,; 2024-02-13 16:00:46]
[My thoughts about Nvidia,;,; All the recent reviews of Nvidia are saying the exact same thing - the AI/ML market is booming, we need better processors to work this hype and run the protocols, and Nvidia has the best architecture to counter this.   True!   The AI market is rising so fast and so high I don't think it's even possible to measure it anymore. Some say 15B, some say 25B is say BS. It's in the trillions. So many companies are running AI modules today with multi billion dollars valuation, they all relay on AI to keep them from bankruptcy. That's far higher than investment bankers are estimating the market to be.  But!!!!  I don't belive it will stay there for too long since there's one technology that threatens Nvidia dominance and it's already there - QUANTUM COMPUTING. Investment bankers knows shit about this futuristic technology and as soon as it breaks out to the market, one quantum computer installed in an azure data center will overcome a full Nvidia data center filled with the best GPUs they can produce.   There's no much room for Nvidia to expand above $1T valuation, but if quantum computing are launched and provide half of what they promised, Nvidia can drop to AMD levels or worse due to expansion expenses and crash.   That's why I'm out.  Not shorting the stock, but sold all my holdings.,;,; 2023-08-15 07:30:36]

[Embracing Nvidia's Momentum: A Bright Future Ahead,;,;    In a recent report, UBS shed light on Nvidia's impressive strides forward, highlighting a significant reduction in lead times to just 3-4 months. This remarkable improvement signifies a robust enhancement in Nvidia's operational efficiency and underscores the company's agility in meeting market demands.  Notably, Nvidia's lead times have seen a drastic reduction from as much as 36-52 weeks to a mere 3-4 months. Such a substantial improvement speaks volumes about Nvidia's commitment to enhancing customer satisfaction and streamlining its supply chain processes.  What does this mean for investors?   It's a testament to Nvidia's resilience and adaptability in a dynamic market environment. With shorter lead times, customers can expect faster delivery of GPUs for AI compute, positioning Nvidia as a reliable and responsive partner in the tech ecosystem.  Nvidia's stellar performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, raking in $14.5 billion in data center hardware revenue, is a testament to the company's unwavering dominance in the AI and high-performance computing sectors. The surge in demand for Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs underscores the market's confidence in Nvidia's cutting-edge technology.  Moreover, Nvidia's expansion of production capacity not only accelerates the pace of lead time reduction but also fuels current revenue growth and earnings. This positive momentum sets the stage for another outstanding performance in the upcoming quarters, potentially culminating in yet another impressive earnings beat.  &amp;#x200B;  [Seeking Alpha](https://preview.redd.it/hfga67n5pric1.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19a02011e99d6cceec2c7c4c787b5c9c3653608c)  &amp;#x200B;  Despite concerns about the eventual plateauing of sequential growth, it's essential to recognize that Nvidia's influence in the AI landscape remains unparalleled. The inevitable decrease in lead times doesn't spell doom for Nvidia; rather, it signifies a natural evolution in the company's growth trajectory.  Looking ahead, Nvidia's commitment to innovation and its robust ecosystem of partners position it for sustained success in the long term. While the market may anticipate challenges on the horizon, Nvidia's track record of outperforming expectations instills confidence in its ability to navigate any headwinds.

[Nvidia + CUDA, the new 3Dfx + Glide,;,; Back in the days, when 3D rendering was taking off, 3Dfx was the leading manufacturer of 3D accelerated GPUs. They had a proprietary rendering standard called Glide, which only worked with 3Dfx cards. It was designed for games and worked well, so game developers had an incentive to use it, which boosted the sales of 3Dfx cards in return.  But it didn't take long for accelerated 3D to become too important outside of gaming, and companies producing 3D software didn't want their products to be only compatible with 3Dfx GPUs. So they adopted new open standards, mainly Direct3D by Microsoft, and Glide was ditched entirely. GPUs that were Direct3D compatible suddenly had an advantage and 3Dfx had now fierce competition.  In 1999 Nvidia released the first GPU that was fully Direct3D compliant. It exploded, and 3Dfx was later bought by Nvidia.  Why is this important? Because it's happening again. AI developers use tools that were built around Nvidia's proprietary AI standard called CUDA. Nvidia is riding a temporary wave where they can sell their hardware because of the wide use of its proprietary standard, not because TSMC produces some magic silicon for them.  History repeats itself, and like the rise of 3D, it won't take long for AI to become too important in general to be dependent on one hardware supplier with his proprietary standard. Open standards exist and are already being pushed, and AI software companies will make sure that their products won't have to be sold bundled with an Nvidia GPU to run properly.,;,; 2023-08-24 12:55:37]
[Be aware - NVIDIA is not the only Tensorcore supplier,;,; Poorly covered in the press. Yes NVIDIA is selling a lot of high margin AI product as Cloud datacenters scale to handle the demand. Be aware they are being positioned as the only option. They are not and in fact have solutions that do not benchmark at the top.   Also be aware that the network infrastructure for AI to AI interconnect is different than historical DC networking.  To address this Google (creator of the modern Tensorcore) created a new networking paradigm - Apollo.   Facebook is working on similar and Tesla (every car is machine learning)  implemented their own (superior) Tensorcore array called DOJO.   Apple is investing deeply into AI and more of the M processor die space will have Tensorcores. AMD and Intel of course are in also in play.  I state this because the hypster press would have you believe NVIDIA has a lock. Not at all. They did not invent it BUT are doing a great job of holding their installed base with it.   The barrier to entry is LOW.  PCI interfaces, memory structures and Tensorcores are all pedestrian readily available tech. NOBODY has a monopoly on it. No moat.  Several other players are also making purpose built AI clusters that scale well beyond anything NVIDIA can even do.   Watch for acquisitions.

[Capitalizing on unparalleled market dominance: Nvidia explosive profits driven by strategic AI investments and technological Advancements.,;,; According to Raymond James analyst, Nvidia's Tender Core GPU is selling for up to 1000% profit. They can't keep them on the shelves because the actual cost of production is $3320.00. Furthermore, according to analysts, Nvidia is making tremendous sums of money and does not appear to be slowing down anytime soon because there is no competition in sight. So these are the most current analyst remarks, and the comment about quarterly earnings is that they expect two things. First, they predict tremendous quarterly earnings and revenues, and second, they expect the stock price to rise. This makes sense given that there were seven price target increases last week ahead of the quarterly earnings report on August 23rd. Again, the Barclay analyst said it best. Nvidia's business model has effectively monopolized the market. I'd have to agree. I recently saw an Nvidia special on how they secretly spent extensively in AI while others assumed they were concentrating on gaming technologies and were completely taken off guard. This went on for a few years before AI took control of the market. You now see why they control 90% of the global market.  Jensen is a highly cautious CEO when it comes to earnings projections. Since Nvidia went public, this has always been the case. I am somewhat confident about this week's earnings report and extremely confident about future earnings given the strong tailwinds of AI, gaming, data center improvements, and the EV automobile revolution. This is my overall experience as a long-term investment in this company. ,;,; 2023-08-21 10:54:11]

OK, maybe for gaming / consumer, but not for LLMs / AI  which is where the money is going to right now. * Yes, everyone including the big cloud hyperscalers (think Amazon, Microsoft, Google) are trying to build or invest in hardware that will replace NVidia, but that will take a few years.

The only way these guys can build that thing - That AGI/ASI/GAI reality - Is through Nvidia.  These guys believe and have tested that if you throw MORE compute at the problem it actually GAINS function. More compute equals more consciousness. That's what these people believe and they're attempting it.  Here, let me show you what I mean. What the graph below shows is that over time the amount of data and parameters that are being used to train an AI model. I implore you to watch this video as it is a great easy to understand educational video into what the hell is going on with all of this AI stuff. It's a little technical but very informative and there are varying opinions. I pulled out the very best part in relation to Nvidia here. [AI: Grappling with a New Kind of Intelligence](https://youtu.be/EGDG3hgPNp8?si=L71CUbmqho3jhKEh&amp;t=3768)  https://preview.redd.it/vk5twc041hic1.png?width=1318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3d2bdf42cf25e1c04e940b2f61d0219871f2334  It's SO RIDICULOUS that you wouldn't be able to continue to see the beginning so they have to use a log plot chart. And as you see we are heading into Trillions of parameters. For reference GPT-4 was trained on roughly 200 billion parameters.  https://preview.redd.it/6cq17n5i1hic1.png?width=1327&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=830334aa7cdaddfa10d7f6512d10025f136076ed  It is estimated GPT-5 will be trained with 2-5 trillion parameters.  Sam Altman was dead ass serious when he is inquiring about obtaining $7 trillion for chip development. They believe that with enough compute they can create GOD.  So what's the response from Google, Meta and others. Well, they're forming "AI ""Alliances""". Along with that they are going to and buying from the largest AI arms dealer on earth; Nvidia.  Nvidia is a common day AI Industrial Complex War machine.  **Sovereign AI with AI Foundries**  It's not just companies that are looking to compete it's also entire Nation States. Remember, when Italy banned GPT. Well, it turns out, countries don't want the United States building and implementing their AI into other country's culture and way of life.  So as of today, you have a battle of not just corporate America but entire countries looking to buy the bullets, tanks and missiles needed for this AI fight. Nvidia sells the absolute best bullets, the best guns, the best ammo one needs to attempt to create their own AI epicenters.  And it's so important that it is a national security risk to not just us the United States but to be a nation and not have the capability of AI.  Remember the leak about Q\* and a certain encryption being undone. You don't think heads of State where listening to that. Whether it was true or not it is now an imperative that you get with AI or get left behind. That goes just as much for a nation as it does for you as an individual.  When asked about the risk of losing out sales to China on Nvidia's last earnings call Jensen Huang clearly stated he was not worried about it because literally nations are coming online to build AI foundries.  **Nvidia's Numbers and The Power Of Compounding**  The power of compounding and why I think there share price is where it is today and has so much more room to grow. Let me ask you a question but first let me say that AWS's annual revenues are at \~$80/Y Billion. How long do you think with Nvidia's revenues of \~$18/Q Billion to reach or eclipse AWS at a 250% growth rate?  15 years? 10 Years? 5 years? Answer: 1.19 years. Ok let's not be ridiculous perhaps it's 200% instead.  5 years? Nope. 1.35 years.  Let's say they have a bad quarter and Italy doesn't pay up. 150%  5 years right? Nope. 1.62 years.  Come on they can't keep this up. 100%.  has to be 5 years this time. Nope. 2.15 years.  100% growth/2.15 years to 250% growth/1.19 years to reach 80 billion in annual revenues.  They're growth last year was 281%.  So wait, I wasn't being fair. I used $80 billion for AWS while their revenues last year where $88 Billion and Nvidia's last years 4 quarters where \~$33 Billion.  Here are those growth numbers it would take Nvidia to reach $88 billion.  At 279% =  0.73 years  At 250% = 0.78 years  At 200% = 0.89 years  at 100% = 1.41 years  Folks. That's JUST the data center. They are poised to surpass AWS, Azure and Google Cloud in about .73 to 1.5 years. Yes, you heard that right, your daddy's cloud company is about to be overtaken by your son's gaming GPU company.

[Hunt for ‚Äònext Nvidia‚Äô draws options traders to Arm‚Äôs soaring stock,;,;  NEW YORK, Feb 12 (Reuters) - The craze for artificial intelligence stocks sent options traders piling into bets on Arm Holdings on Monday, with many positioning for more gains in the shares after they almost doubled in price in less than a week. Arm Holdings' shares are up 80% since Wednesday, after the company forecast better-than-expected quarterly results powered by demand for its technology to design chips for artificial intelligence features.  The jump in the stock price has ignited trading in the chip designer's options, with volume soaring to about 490,000 contracts a day over the last three sessions. That is more than 10 times the options' average daily trading volume in the month prior to the earnings report, according to Trade Alert data. The exploding options volume pointed to investors hunting for the 'next NVIDIA,' said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group, noting that the surge in bullish options activity was likely helping boost the stock.  Chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA.O) at the center of the artificial intelligence frenzy, has risen about 220% over the last year, making it the best performing S&amp;P 500 stock for that period. On Monday, 600,000 Arm contracts changed hands by 2:15 p.m. (1915 GMT), with the day's volume projected to hit a record 816,000 contracts, data showed. With Arm shares up 20% at $137.72 on Monday, call options on the shares rising above $185 by Friday were the most actively traded Arm contracts. Call options convey the right to buy shares at a set price in the future, while puts offer the right to sell shares.  Arm's share price rise has made for massive gains for recent bullish options bets. For instance a trader who had bought about 5,000 of ARM January 2026 calls for about $12.2 million on Feb. 7, saw the value of those contracts jump to about $42 million, based on their last trading price, on Monday. Despite those gains, the trader appeared to be holding on to those call options, a bullish sign for the stock, Murphy said.  ARM puts were also busy on Monday, possibly pointing to some investors looking to lock in some of the stocks' recent gains, he said. Arm's technology is not directly used in the AI work, but companies like Nvidia are choosing it for central processing units that complement their AI-specific chips.,;,; 2024-02-12 22:58:22]

[Nvidia Stock Gains, but the AI Hype Is Shifting Elsewhere ‚Äî Barron's,;,; Nvidia was edging up Friday but the chip maker's rally has been leveling out slightly as other stocks related to artificial intelligence take the spotlight.  Nvidia shares were rising 0.4% to $699.45 in premarket trading.  Nvidia stock closed down 0.7% at $696.41 on Thursday, after breaking through the $700 barrier and setting a new record high the previous day.  Nvidia's rally has left it outpacing Wall Street targets, with analysts having an average target price on the stock of $687.70, according to FactSet. That appears to have prompted investors to focus on other stocks poised to benefit from investment in AI.  Chip designer Arm Holdings and power-management device maker Monolithic Power Systems both surged on Thursday after their respective earnings, which were boosted by spending on AI. Both are now notably more expensive than Nvidia on a forward price-to-earnings basis but investors looked eager to spread their AI bets across the market.  Among other chip makers on Friday, Advanced Micro Devices was down 0.1% and Intel was up 0.4%.  Nvidia shares have risen 27% over the last month. The S&amp;P 500 has risen 4.5% over the same period and the Nasdaq Composite has gained 5.5%.

[Trading Nvidia earnings next week: Analysts say ‚ÄòAI gold rush‚Äô should boost outlook,;,; NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) price target was raised at Oppenheimer and Susquehanna ahead of its earnings release after the close on Wednesday, May 24.  Oppenheimer analysts raised the firm's price target on the stock to $350 from $300, maintaining an Outperform rating. They told investors they see upside to the company's print and outlook.  "DC expected up through the year as cloud vendors scale-out AI infrastructure. ChatGPT has sparked a sense of urgency some are calling "AI's iPhone moment". AI models continue to grow and proliferate. NVDA's full stack hardware/software platform remains the cornerstone to an expanding AI ecosystem," they wrote. "DC, high-performance gaming, and auto are a triple play for sustained growth."  Susquehanna analysts raised the price target on Positive-rated NVDA to $350 from $310 per share. The analysts said the AI arms race should drive a constructive DC outlook.  "Overall, we expect better results/guidance, driven largely by the ongoing AI gold rush and subsequent DC GPU demand," they said. "We are expecting great things from DC, with Gaming continuing its recovery."  Elsewhere, Deutsche Bank analysts, who have a Hold rating and $220 price target on NVDA, said they expect a solid report and guidance.  There is "room for upside vs. the Street in both as the ever-growing list of potential applications for AI has driven strong demand for NVDA's leading AI compute processors," they added.  "We expect the AI-enthusiasm to carry the day and likely continue to provide a strong safety net for the share price despite its somewhat amazing +107% appreciation YTD."

[Nvidia blowout earnings ripple across tech, highlighting winners and questions.,;,; Nvidia earnings have been a significant milestone for the tech industry, with a 101% increase in revenue to $13.51 billion. The company has become a bellwether for the AI boom, with an ecosystem where a win for Nvidia can come in tandem with wins for some additional companies. The Magnificent Seven, including big tech companies like Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft, as well as banks and financial institutions that invested directly, are expected to benefit from Nvidia's rise.  Amazon and Microsoft are particularly key due to their existing cloud partnerships with Nvidia, while Meta has an existing consumer-focused partnership with the chipmaker. Snowflake and VMware also emerged as winners, both of which have relatively new enterprise partnerships. Alphabet's shares rose as much as 3% after Nvidia's report, and Nvidia and Google Cloud announced a partnership emphasizing AI hardware in March.  Despite the AI hype, Nvidia's earnings show some key resilience. Competitors such as Qualcomm, Intel, and AMD saw their shares in the red on Thursday, with AMD experiencing the steepest decline. However, there is still room for all in the current market, as competition is fierce and they have different strengths and weaknesses.  Critical infrastructure for the AI boom is also shifting, with companies having to revamp their existing systems over time to meet the demand for AI. Data centers, at the center of operations for most tech companies, are in flux as the demand for Nvidia chips is re-forming how data centers will operate and grow. As AI pushes data center buildings to be larger and denser than ever before, companies must adapt to meet the growing demand for AI. ,;,; 2023-08-25 10:32:17]

[TSMC's Advanced Packaging Struggles: Nvidia Devours Capacity, AMD Joins the Chase,;,; Key points from the news:  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;TSMC, the leading semiconductor foundry, is set to significantly expand its chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) advanced packaging capacity by the end of 2024. According to DigiTimes, TSMC plans to increase its CoWoS capacity from 8,000 wafers per month to 11,000 wafers per month by the end of this year and aims to reach around 20,000 wafers per month by the end of 2024. However, even with this expansion, it is anticipated that Nvidia will consume approximately half of the capacity available at that time. AMD is also reportedly seeking additional CoWoS capacity for next year.   &gt;   &gt;The growing demand for technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), and high-performance computing (HPC) is driving the adoption of complex multi-chiplet designs, exemplified by products like AMD's Instinct MI300 and Nvidia's H100. Nvidia, in particular, is considered the primary beneficiary of the increasing demand for AI-focused compute GPUs and currently controls over 90% of compute GPU shipments for new deployments. Consequently, TSMC is facing challenges in meeting the demand for its CoWoS advanced packaging solutions.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Presently, TSMC has the capacity to process approximately 8,000 CoWoS wafers per month, with Nvidia and AMD utilizing about 70% to 80% of this capacity. Following them, Broadcom represents the third-largest user, accounting for around 10% of the available CoWoS wafer processing capacity. The remaining capacity is divided among 20 other fabless chip designers.   &gt;   &gt;Expanding CoWoS capacity requires specialized production tools, and their lead times typically range from three to six months. Hence, TSMC's ability to rapidly increase its CoWoS capacity is constrained.,;,; 2023-06-13 18:09:14]

[Will Nvidia Follow in Infineon's Footsteps? What Happened to NVDA's European Analog After the Report,;,; Drawing a parallel between Infineon Technologies and Nvidia isn't entirely appropriate. Infineon primarily focuses on semiconductor solutions for the automotive sector, industrial uses, and energy-saving technologies. On the other hand, Nvidia is renowned for its GPUs, high-performance computing, and contributions to artificial intelligence and deep learning.  Still, if Infineon does venture into integrating artificial intelligence chips within its products, the lines distinguishing them could fade.  Currently, their revenue and net profit are in the same ballpark, and there was a time, roughly 8-10 years ago, when Infineon had a slight edge.  Yet, examining their market capitalization paints a different picture, one that sparks curiosity. Infineon released its earnings on August 3, and they were impressive. For Nvidia to match in terms of EPS, they'd need to report over $4.8.

[JPMorgan Analyst Cautions Investors: Potential AI Industry Trends May Impact NVIDIA Share Price,;,; Date: August 3, 2023  In a comprehensive analysis of the ever-evolving AI industry, financial powerhouse JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has issued a warning to investors regarding the potential impact on NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ: NVDA) share price. NVIDIA, renowned for its groundbreaking innovations in graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI technology, may face headwinds due to emerging trends in the AI sector, according to the report released today.  JPMorgan's expert analysts have highlighted a few key factors that could potentially affect NVIDIA's performance in the coming months. One of the primary concerns raised is the intensified competition within the AI chip market. As the demand for AI-powered solutions surges across various industries, rival semiconductor companies have been intensifying their efforts to secure a larger share of the burgeoning market. This competition could potentially impact NVIDIA's market share and profitability.  Moreover, the report underscores the significance of AI advancements in alternative technologies, such as neuromorphic computing and quantum computing, which could potentially disrupt traditional GPU-based AI processing. While NVIDIA has made significant strides in AI research and development, the emergence of alternative computing paradigms may pose challenges and uncertainties for the company's future prospects.  Additionally, the AI industry is heavily reliant on data, and concerns over data privacy and security have been growing.

[Unleashing the Hybrid Cloud AI Revolution: Nvidia's DGX, IBM's Ansible, and the Perfect Storm,;,; Not financial advice!  Nvidia's recent product announcements may provide valuable clues about the future of AI and which companies are best positioned for the value AI will unlock. I'm not personally interested in buying  NVDA at current prices, as its price seems to be close to at least somewhat re-rated to market expectations.  We're early in the game here de-gens and there might be other opportunities worth exploring that are flying under the radar.  It' this regard‚Äôs opinion that reading between the lines of Nvidia's new product roadmap, can uncover potential AI benefits that haven't yet been fully reflected in the stock prices of other companies.  So‚Ä¶ Nvidia has dropped a big one with its new DGX AI platform. If you're into the tech scene, you know Nvidia is a man amongst boys in the AI space. This DGX thing? It's a beast. Imagine a supercharged AI playground, but it's not just playing around - it's working, and working damn hard.  It's gonna be huge for our cloud bros - Amazon's AWS, Microsoft's Azure, Google Cloud, IBM, all of 'em. They'll be drooling all over this DGX platform. Why? It's like an AI power-up. Whoever taps into this beast will have their AI game leveled up big time.  But here's where the fun starts. This DGX tech isn't just good for any cloud - it's perfect for the hybrid cloud approach. That's where you mix up your on-premises servers (that's tech talk for the old-school, actual physical stuff) with public cloud services. This hybrid stuff is a big deal for AI because it gives you flexibility, security, and the raw horsepower you need to run high-powered AI applications. And guess who's the hybrid cloud champ? It's our old friend IBM, who's been pushing the hybrid cloud way harder than anyone else.  And how does IBM do it? Enter Ansible. This thing is like the magic wand for setting up and managing hybrid cloud stuff. It's a massive hit with the tech geeks because it's like a cheat code for making complex stuff simple. Ansible lets you stand up new hybrid cloud AI products and services like you're flipping pancakes.  Now, Ansible's part of IBM's tool kit, thanks to their acquisition of Red Hat a while back. IBM + Ansible + hybrid cloud is like the dream team for leveraging Nvidia's DGX platform. While all the cloud providers are gonna want a piece of the DGX pie, IBM is sitting pretty with their hybrid cloud focus and their Ansible magic.  Bottom line: Nvidia's DGX platform is throwing down the gauntlet in the AI game, and it's shouting "hybrid cloud or bust!" IBM's sitting in the sweet spot with Ansible and their hybrid cloud game.  IBM‚Äôs share value has been mostly stagnant over the past few months.  No AI respect!  No AI respect here at all I tell ya!

[NVDA pullback imminent,;,; ,;,; 2024-02-05 14:25:29]
[NVDA NVDA NVDA Earnings TODAY!,;,; Guys, it's finally time. NVIDIA's earnings report is today - after hours. I'm sitting here waiting on what they have to say regarding their new AI developments. Despite the recent shakeups in AI leadership and the U.S. government's tightened chip export rules, NVIDIA seems unfazed, hitting a new all time high.  The hot topic for NVIDIA's management this earnings call will be their strategies to overcome supply constraints and cater to the soaring demand. The analysts are fixed on an expected revenue of $16.2 billion for the October quarter, with adjusted EPS hitting $3.37. The anticipation ramps up for the current quarter, with revenue estimates at a whopping $18.0 billion.  NVIDIA's shares have been on a bullish ride, up 2.3% at $504.20 on Monday. This surge aligns with Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar's optimistic stance, who reaffirms a **$620 price target** on NVIDIA shares, spotlighting the robust demand from U.S. cloud and data center clients. The key challenge, according to Kumar, is the supply of GPUs, which are literally the lifeblood of NVIDIA's dominance in the AI chip market.  Their GPUs, crucial for parallel computations needed in AI model training, are at the forefront of the AI revolution. The high-end H100, launched earlier this year, quickly turned into a sought-after resource, thanks to the burgeoning interest in generative AI. The announcement of the H200 Tensor Core GPU, expected in Q2 2024, is already stirring talks of a new wave of demand.  NVIDIA's pace in releasing chips is also noteworthy. Moving from a two-year to a one-year product cycle for AI chips, NVIDIA is set to unleash more high-end AI products in 2024 and 2025. This strategy could be a game-changer in maintaining their market dominance.  In the backdrop of NVIDIA's stock hitting a record high of $504.09 per share, the upcoming earnings report is more than just numbers. It's a snapshot of NVIDIA's stronghold in the 2023 AI narrative. Here's a quick look at what Wall Street expects versus last year's performance:  - Revenue: $16.1 billion expected, a significant leap from $5.93 billion in Q3 last year. - Adjusted EPS: $3.36 expected, up from $0.58 in Q3 last year. - Data center revenue: $12.82 billion expected, a major jump from $3.83 billion in Q3 last year. - Gaming revenue: Expected to hit $2.7 billion, up from $1.57 billion.  Amidst these projections, the fourth quarter revenue guidance is critical, with expectations set at $17.8 billion. NVIDIA has been shattering expectations, and Wall Street is eager to see if this trend continues.  However, not all is smooth sailing. The stock experienced a hiccup post-August report as valuation concerns and China's chip restrictions posed challenges. NVIDIA's SEC filing indicates minimal near-term impact from these restrictions, and analysts like Stifel's Ruben Roy expect similar reassurances in the earnings call.  NVIDIA's role as a market momentum driver is undeniable. As a member of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, including Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla, NVIDIA has helped propel the collective gains of these giants by over 70% this year.  Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel's advice to investors: brace for "post-NVDA volatility," as the stock's performance post-earnings could set the tone for the market. In essence, it's NVIDIA's world, and we're just trading in it.  So there you have it, guys. It's not just them playing the AI game, they're literally in control of it. Due to the high strike price, NVDA calls are a little too expensive for an "earning" play. So I'm gonna suggest a call spread. Let's just *assume* it goes up 5%. What type of call spread would we need for max profit? I'd grab a NVDA 11/24 500c for 1830 and sell the 525c for 905. This basically means you can grab the spread for $925. If it were to go up 5%, that means potentially 170% profit.   With previous earnings, it's moved way more than 5% on average, so this should be an okay bet. Although still expensive. Keep in mind, like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too.,;,; 2023-11-21 19:43:39]

[What's your prediction for NVDA in the next few months?,;,; *(Last post was deleted probably due to profanity in the title)*  **Fellow regards, what's your prediction for NVDA for the next few months?** Personally I will benefit from it going down because I bought some $605 puts expiring in April.  Bear thesis:  * Nancy  might have already sold her calls, but we will only hear about it after 30 days when she files that form. * Companies with similar cap typically have a revenue of hundreds billions, while NVDA's revenue of last quarter is only 18 billions. * Currently price level already priced in a great earnings. Anything short of a GOAT earning could result in a selloff. * A few tech companies beat earnings this week but still the stock tanked. * r/wallstreetbets's general sentiment is bullish on the stock, which means it's time to inverse.

[160k NVDA put YOLO,;,; Hey regards,  I lost big time on PYPL play. I lost 10k on NVDA earnings. I'm generally a bear because in falling market you make gains much quicker than in bull runs. No one is ever panic buying as much as people tend to panic sell. I know that I was right, I was just early. Now I'm back. Call it copium and delusional regardery if you want. I do believe NVDA is a good company with good future ahead and I wish I owned it long term before the hype, don't get me wrong. But the hype is too much and unsustainable continuously. I believe NVDA will be doing good long-term and might even get to the $800-1000 territory eventually. But I'm betting my all-time gains from trading and then some on the fact that it will tank one more time in terms of a correction, reversing to the mean and becoming "normal" after which it will steadily go up as it's fundamentally a good stock. When the bears will have that one last attempt to beat it down, that's when I won't be as stupid as I was with PayPal, I will cease my chance and I will cash out.  Beware this is my get lambo or get slaughtered like a lamb kind of a deal and I'm fully aware of it. There's nothing in between. If I lose, I'll be rotting in my day job the same way.

I'm risking amount that might make me much poorer but not ruined, so never risk what you can't lose to the point where there's no other solution than buying calls for $ROPE.

[Shorting NVDA at 740 is literally free money at this point,;,; **Why**  The expectation is that they greatly exceed earnings - so even if they do, the pop won't be anything insane, maybe 6-8% or so. That's probably what's going to happen.  However. If they even slightly falter, then it's going to crater 10-15% at a minimum - I see 650 as a reasonable spot to exit honestly.  I'm just seeing all of the little slots on SoFi that dozens and dozens of people are buying in and it feels like they're lambs being brought to slaughter. Double top, majority of investors only in it for the momentum (which has been waning the last few days), Google's chips, so many reasons for it to fall and for it to fall \_now\_.  I'm a software engineer at an AI startup and yeah I see the insane costs/demand for these but it's a \_hardware\_ company and not software that can scale infinitely at no marginal cost. Now that I think about it, I really think I should've invested in it when I first saw that side of things but now I'm just doing it out of spite. Or that the one other big short I did was COIN from 180 =&gt; 150 and this feels the same sentiment-wise. idk either way works  **Positions**  * (-20) NVDA @ 705 - 134% of that account, started on 02-06 * 200 NVD @ 8.95 fifteen minutes ago * Other more reasonable choices  **Afterword**  Well in the time I wrote this it fell from 740 to 727 so never mind I guess, it's slightly less profitable of a trade but the point still stands (which is left as an exercise for the reader)  **Edit**  [This account](https://preview.redd.it/5spcopmb3lic1.png?width=1904&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6420b7f09a517d74c6dde2846422073376fd5ca)  **Edit 2**  * Closed NVD @ 9.27  **Edit 3**  * Y'all - It is just money guys and here's the thing: I don't lose when it is worth more than my account (cause it already is). I lose when the *losses* are worth more than my account. Just going to hold through earnings, any losses are offset by the money market interest anyways  **Edit 4**  * NVD is 1.5x inverse NVDA. I did not close the NVDA lol     **Edit 5**  * My oh my the bullish comments have slowed down! What happened?!?  * Anyways those were kind of proving my point. The price reflected something like 99% chance of maintaining zero competition and continuing the insane growth for like a decade. That's true that's what it looks like now, and I feel like the underlying facts are going to change soon for its valuation. The price reflected something like a 99% chance of absolutely demolishing earnings and didn't leave a lot of upside for if they even do.  * Also, I felt like that was the reverse sort of effect happening - only people buying at that level were shorts capitalizing and it's kind of like how we hit a super-bottom in 2022 from margin calls. Shorts have already \*been\* getting wrecked which is why it was a better entry at 740 than say 500. * I can't even drink yet so stop trying to flex your buys from when I was in middle school lol,;,; 2024-02-14 16:05:38]

[NVDA will fall on Monday to 700 because,;,; 1. We are facing resistance at 720 which signals a retracing with the decreasing volume. This has historically always been followed by a fall of 1-3%  2. Anytime the stock has soared 15-20$ it is followed by a sideways movement in the market followed by a drop. Since institutional investors are aware we know this, they will sell off a day early on Monday instead of Tuesday  3. There‚Äôs no more catalysts coming up. Today‚Äôs boom was brought on by the announcement of their custom chip segment which is now already priced in. They cannot have any more surprises ahead of earnings without risking a boost in price beyond analyst forecasts which causes their price to crater  4. Institutional investors saw my last post listing a decrease in price and bought in droves to drive out what they perceive as the majority of WSB investors. Since the OG meme stock they have been scared of us and actively use the sentiment in our posts to bet against us. It had over 500k impressions meaning it was definitely on their radar  5. Basic game theory: earnings will be nowhere close to the expectations of the guidance given by NVDA, and institutional investors know this. As such the usual approach where buying options 2 weeks ahead of earnings to capitalize on volatility is moot. It‚Äôs a race against time to see which big player sells first while they try to maximize their gains. Once one player sells, it will trigger a cascading effect causing the price to drop fast. We could see 690‚Äôs  6. I bought calls expiring 2/16 at $690  7. I want to double down on institutional investors being aware of this post. They will sell off/trade side ways to go against the trending posts in this sub  Edit: my original post had 800k impressions   Edit 2: after market is flat instead of gapping up which usually happens after a run up like this.

[NVDA will drop into the 670‚Äôs tomorrow because,;,; 1. No more catalysts from other companies to artificially boost interest. With volume decreasing day over day and price falling, a reversal is likely given the failed push past $700  2. Competition from ARM has actually had a negative impact on NVIDIA‚Äôs stock today as investors flocked to alternatives, while ARM continued to rise. The original boost on Thursday was far more likely attributed to Morgan Stanley increasing their price target $750  3. Every Thursday of this year if the stock went sideways/decreased into the end of the day, the stock would drop $15-20 the next day (save for catalysts from other corps - which aren‚Äôt coming). Similar pattern can be seen on any chart where NVDA has declined or traded flat the previous day   4. Institutional investors are not going to be buying anymore stock knowing a sharp correction is imminent 2 weeks out. They will be far more inclined to lock profit in and sell as the price dips and corrects before buying back in the 70-80‚Äôs.  4.5. NVDA‚Äôs previous guidance is going to screw them at earnings as the market has expectations beyond anything they themselves broadcasted, which will lead to a correction down to the mid 600‚Äôs  5.

[Bullish on NVDA after Intel Guidance,;,; As many of you know the Intel guidance dropped and it‚Äôs had an impact on NVDA and AMD respectively. The issue here is that intels drop in demand is for specifically for ‚Äúchips used in the traditional server and personal computer markets‚Äù. https://www.reuters.com/technology/chipmaker-intel-forecasts-quarterly-revenue-below-estimates-2024-01-25/  That is to say nothing to do with the AI chips that NVDA and AMD are building on their inventory which the hype is blasting off of.   In a separate statement the CEO goes on to say that they expect ‚Äú$2 billion worth of orders for its AI chips and expects better sales later in the year‚Äù.  Who gives a damn if their laptop and server business is dying? The future is AI. The drop we‚Äôre seeing in aftermarket for both NVDA and AMD is unrelated to what they are producing compared to Intel.  With NVDA expecting 20 billion in revenue it‚Äôs absurd to correlate the dying performance of one company with the stellar sales of another.  https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nvidia-stock-nvda-what-to-expect-in-2024#  Now I understand the market is irrational and there will most likely be a dip on open but it really don‚Äôt make any sense to me. The loss in revenue from Intel is correlated with the absurd growth Nvidia has been having.   With a 1.1 trillion valuation the computing power and software to boot, I think if anything a decline in intel should be a sign of the absurd market dominance NVDA has.  https://techhq.com/2023/12/can-intel-ai-chips-take-the-fight-to-amd-and-nvidia/#:~:text=In%20this%20tech%20maelstrom%2C%20Nvidia,as%20per%20industry%20analysts'%20projections.,;,; 2024-01-26 02:10:42]

So where‚Äôs the new money coming from for these high priced NVDA AI chips?    3) The jury is out regarding the direction of AI.  Bing hasn‚Äôt made a dent with ChatGBT with regard to stealing market share from Google.  New horizons are not well defined.   4) NVDA still relies on revenue for conventional gaming chips for PC‚Äôs and crypto mining.  Both these areas are fading.  5) There is still competition out there for the AI chip market.  I like AMD with their APU (accelerated processing unit) chips combining both CPU and GPU in one.

[To all the NVDA bears‚Ä¶ why?,;,; I‚Äôm trying to reasonably understand the bear case for NVDA. Considering pretty much every Wall Street Analyst only makes bull cases for Nvidia, there aren‚Äôt any reputable sources I can read for the bear case.  The bull case seems clear: the rapidly growing demand for semiconductors with AI/ML-capabilities to use in Data Centers (DC). Pretty much every large tech company is buying up land for DCs, such as in Northern Virginia, and are releasing plans to buy tons of NVDA chips for their new DCs and to upgrade their old DCs. Congress is also choosing NVDA as their favorite chip-maker, forbidding them from selling premier chips to China, presumably to use NVDA for defense-related cyber operations, creating a future for significant government demand. Gen-AI was the catalyst, but machine learning and government cyberops is the demand. Concerning its price, anyone can tell you how NVDA is still cheap relative to other chip-makers by forward p/e.  So far, the posts here that warn of an ‚Äúimminent NVDA crash‚Äù are all pseudo-investing‚Ä¶ not one discusses flaws in their business strategy. The argument range from ‚Äúan unrelated tech company had a similar rise 20 years ago, and their stock fell after the Internet bubble burst,‚Äù ‚Äúit rose so quickly, so it must be overvalued,‚Äù to ‚ÄúI‚Äôve shorted it, so it just has to fall or else I‚Äôm screwed.‚Äù,;,; 2024-02-18 22:41:34]

[I‚Äôm back from bank crisis with 80k loss. Now, this time‚Äôs different. $NVDA,;,; NVDA may hold promise for the future, but its current Price to Earnings (PE) and Price to Sales (PS) ratios are less than impressive. Earnings appear stagnant, with PC gaming in decline. The majority of their profit is derived from data services, rather than Al.  Moreover, we're grappling with the debt ceiling limit. When analyzing patterns from past 'blood weeks', history shows NVDA experienced a 30% drop during such events. The economic outlook is not favorable and there's a downward trend, as evidenced by the overvaluation of PPD. Despite being hyped and exceeding $100 due to strong buying pressure for a significant period, it now faces a 40% reduction.  Add to that the ongoing uncertainty around the China trade war, and you have a multitude of reasons contributing to a potential decrease in the stock's value.  Disclosure: I hold over 17k short positions in NVDA. My investment track record is far from flawless - I lost approximately 80k last March and, to date, Fidelity has yet to retrieve my funds.

With earnings in about a month and a half, we more than likely will see either a small double top and/or retest before slowly seeing it drift off into a short-term bearish habitat. From there, it will be in the hands of Jensen Huang to showcase the performance of his company on May 24th.

AI is the internet plus the ability to reason and analyze anything you give it in fractions of a second. A new unequivocal boomstick to whomever wants to use it.  The true winners will be those startups in fields such as robotics, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, space-aeronautics, aviation, protein synthesis, new materials and so, so much more who will use AI in new and exciting ways.  Boston dynamics, set to boom. Self-driving robotaxis, set to boom. Flying taxis, set to boom. Job replacement/automation for legacy industry jobs white collar, set to boom. Personal AI agents for your individual workloads, booming. Healthcare change as we know it (doctors won't like this but too bad), set to boom.  The amount of industry that is set to shift and mutate and emerge from AI in the next 3 - 5 years will be astonishing.  I can tell you, standing on principal, that OpenAI's next release will be so game changing that nobody will deny where AI is heading. There is not a rock you can hide under to be so oblivious as to not see where this is going.  The reason why I bring up the next iteration of ChatGPT, GPT5, is because they are initiators of this phenomenon. Other, such as Google (and others) are furiously trying to catch up but as of today the 'MOAT' may be upon us.  The reason to believe that one may catch up (or try like hell to) is from the amount of compute power from GPU's it takes to train an ungodly amount of data. Trillions of data points. Billions (soon to be Trillions) of parameters all simulating that of the synaptic neuron connections in which the human brain functions that in turn gives us the spark of life and consciousness. Make no mistake, these guys are living out a present day Manhattan project.  These people are trying to build consciousness agency with the all the world's information as a reference document at it's finger tips. Today.  And guess what. The only way these guys can build that thing - That AGI/ASI/GAI reality - Is through Nvidia.  These guys believe and have tested that if you throw MORE compute at the problem it actually GAINS function. More compute equals more consciousness. That's what these people believe and they're attempting it.  Here, let me show you what I mean. What the graph below shows is that over time the amount of data and parameters that are being used to train an AI model. I implore you to watch this video as it is a great easy to understand educational video into what the hell is going on with all of this AI stuff. It's a little technical but very informative and there are varying opinions. I pulled out the very best part in relation to Nvidia here. [AI: Grappling with a New Kind of Intelligence](https://youtu.be/EGDG3hgPNp8?si=L71CUbmqho3jhKEh&amp;t=3768)  https://preview.redd.it/vk5twc041hic1.png?width=1318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3d2bdf42cf25e1c04e940b2f61d0219871f2334  It's SO RIDICULOUS that you wouldn't be able to continue to see the beginning so they have to use a log plot chart. And as you see we are heading into Trillions of parameters. For reference GPT-4 was trained on roughly 200 billion parameters.  https://preview.redd.it/6cq17n5i1hic1.png?width=1327&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=830334aa7cdaddfa10d7f6512d10025f136076ed  It is estimated GPT-5 will be trained with 2-5 trillion parameters.  Sam Altman was dead ass serious when he is inquiring about obtaining $7 trillion for chip development. They believe that with enough compute they can create GOD.  So what's the response from Google, Meta and others. Well, they're forming "AI ""Alliances""". Along with that they are going to and buying from the largest AI arms dealer on earth; Nvidia.  Nvidia is a common day AI Industrial Complex War machine.  **Sovereign AI with AI Foundries**  It's not just companies that are looking to compete it's also entire Nation States. Remember, when Italy banned GPT. Well, it turns out, countries don't want the United States building and implementing their AI into other country's culture and way of life.  So as of today, you have a battle of not just corporate America but entire countries looking to buy the bullets, tanks and missiles needed for this AI fight. Nvidia sells the absolute best bullets, the best guns, the best ammo one needs to attempt to create their own AI epicenters.  And it's so important that it is a national security risk to not just us the United States but to be a nation and not have the capability of AI.  Remember the leak about Q\* and a certain encryption being undone. You don't think heads of State where listening to that. Whether it was true or not it is now an imperative that you get with AI or get left behind. That goes just as much for a nation as it does for you as an individual.  When asked about the risk of losing out sales to China on Nvidia's last earnings call Jensen Huang clearly stated he was not worried about it because literally nations are coming online to build AI foundries.  **Nvidia's Numbers and The Power Of Compounding**  The power of compounding and why I think there share price is where it is today and has so much more room to grow. Let me ask you a question but first let me say that AWS's annual revenues are at \~$80/Y Billion. How long do you think with Nvidia's revenues of \~$18/Q Billion to reach or eclipse AWS at a 250% growth rate?  15 years? 10 Years? 5 years? Answer: 1.19 years. Ok let's not be ridiculous perhaps it's 200% instead.  5 years? Nope. 1.35 years.  Let's say they have a bad quarter and Italy doesn't pay up. 150%  5 years right? Nope. 1.62 years.  Come on they can't keep this up. 100%.  has to be 5 years this time. Nope. 2.15 years.  100% growth/2.15 years to 250% growth/1.19 years to reach 80 billion in annual revenues.  They're growth last year was 281%.  So wait, I wasn't being fair. I used $80 billion for AWS while their revenues last year where $88 Billion and Nvidia's last years 4 quarters where \~$33 Billion.  Here are those growth numbers it would take Nvidia to reach $88 billion.  At 279% =  0.73 years  At 250% = 0.78 years  At 200% = 0.89 years  at 100% = 1.41 years  Folks. That's JUST the data center. They are poised to surpass AWS, Azure and Google Cloud in about .73 to 1.5 years. Yes, you heard that right, your daddy's cloud company is about to be overtaken by your son's gaming GPU company.  When people say Nvidia is undervalued. This is what they are talking about. This is a P/S story not a P/E story.

[NVDA and a quick lesson on P/E,;,; Lots of people were saying NVDA was overpriced because its P/E was over 200. In fact, current P/E was around 245 before these earnings. How is this P/E calculated? Simply take the current price (470 right before close) and divide it by the TTM Diluted EPS (1.92 before today - 0.26 + 0.27 + 0.57 + 0.82).  Today, the company reported an astonishing 2.48 EPS, which will replace the 0.26 from 1 year ago and bring the TTM Diluted EPS from 1.92 to 4.14 and automatically reduce the current P/E from 245 to 125 (515/4.14).  You may be asking yourself. Why should I care about the EPS from year ago? You shouldn't. That's why investors always look at the forward P/E. And this is where it gets interesting because Wall Street is forecasting total EPS of 8.29 for the year. If they are right (and they probably aren't since NVDA will most likely blow this number out of the water), the forward P/E for the year would be 62 (515/8.29). That is nothing for a company with so much good stuff ahead like NVDA.  TLDR: NVDA to the moon!,;,; 2023-08-23 21:52:36]

Sure, it's massively over-valued and a lot of it is based on hype rather then actual growth, but... the same has been said repeatedly about TSLA in multiple years and I've got my ass-handed me to each time I tried to unleash my inner Burry with that stock.  However, something happened today to just about push me off the fence and make what I'll grant you maybe a very regarded play. I opened up Google and checked my tickers. Saw PLTR having another great day. DKNG doing pretty nicely. FRCB tanking, but considering I'm down 99% on that it doesn't really matter (that's another regarded story for another time).

Anyways, I have no idea when this stock is going to lose its wood so I'm not going to buy puts (options scare me if I'm honest anyways), but I'm in for the next several months unless I get wiped out.    ,;,; 2023-07-17 16:54:27]
[$381 NVDA Price Target: I Am Shorting.,;,; Looking into institution's price target for NVIDIA, i was a little bit concerned about the current price action, seeing a huge ass bubble not gonna lie, that's why i tried my best to give it a Fair Value Evaluation.  Just to go directly to the point, I did my math and evaluations, the Fair value of my calculation is $381, discounting future potential, hype, market shenanigans etc.  I used DCF analysis that gave me $160, this looks into the company's financials  Graham's looks into the market expectation and gives us a price target factored with hype of $955  While Graham's number brings us to the earth  The average of the three gives us a value of $381  https://preview.redd.it/cj2v5w971l7b1.png?width=360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8067c8d3f5b57cb1c9597c3a4f002755fa880540  Below you can see that i just filled a short position.

[My Plan for NVDA Earnings: Least Regarded Option + Decent Payoff,;,; I have devised my plan for NVDA this week, after much thought about balancing my burning desire to play earnings while also not wanting to get vaporized to $0.  There are 3 things that can happen after NVDA earnings. Up, down, sideways.  If you buy calls and it goes down or sideways, you are fucked.  If you buy puts and it goes up or sideways, you are fucked.  If you open a PUTS CREDIT SPREAD, you ONLY get fucked if it goes down and STAYS under your shorted put's strike by expiry. Sideways, you max profit. Up, you max profit even sooner. Hell, even if it goes down a little, anything over your strike at expiry is still max profit. Can't go tits up (unless it gets bombed to 600 or something)  If you short a put around the 700 strike and are willing to go pretty wide on the spread, you can set up a trade with a roughly equal max profit and loss, each of about $2k.  Credit put spread is the move here.  I will open this spread after earnings report on a dip which is likely to happen. From there it should have no problem staying over my selected strike, probably in the 690-700 range, the rest of the week. All NVDA has to do is survive above the shorted strike for 2 days and you max profit.  Change my mind that this is the best way to play it.  EDIT: as u/sharp-direction-6894 pointed out, if for some reason NVDA tanks after I open this spread, I can simply close the short put and keep the long. The longed put will likely recoup most of the losses or even put me back in profit. This is a good safety net to have.  TLDR: Puts credit spread results:  NVDA UP: MAX PROFIT.  NVDA SIDEWAYS: MAX PROFIT.  NVDA DOWN: Cut long put keep short put, minimize loss, maybe still win if dump is huge.,;,; 2024-02-18 19:44:41]

[History will repeat itself, NVDA will correct,;,;  "Be greedy when others' are fearful and fearful when other are greedy", a timeless homage to market trends and investor psychology. I don't think there's any other place on the internet that embodies this sentiment more than [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/), and we've seen it time and time again. GameS, AMC, BTC, DOGE, TSLA, and a host of other securities that have been peddled and pumped on this site have all experienced periods of bloated overinflation. And every single time the market eventually reaches equilibrium, it corrects to reflect an accurate valuation of the stock. NVDA is not going to be any different, I believe were on the precipice of this shift in momentum. I mean seriously, the bullish sentiment here has exceeded anything reasonable, people are just throwing their money into the stock with practically no fundamental basis. To put it short, people are being greedy - and it's time to short. I'm not trying to be a broken clock, I know this has been posted already by countless others, but I wanted to add my voice to this shit-cophony and point out that we've seen this already. This isn't a Yolo post, but I'll attach my position below to prove that I full heartedly believe what I'm saying.   https://preview.redd.it/y70fxcwal1cb1.png?width=567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff8d85b274c7de0cf589ea3d738fb205046434cc,;,; 2023-07-15 02:46:00]
[NVDA is cooking their books. And so are others.,;,; Here is their latest earnings report: https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/2024/q3/NVIDIA-10Q.pdf  Their net income for Q3 2023 is $17B.  However their account receivable has gone up to $8B from $3B in Q1 2023. (page 4-5)  Which means they have declared net income of approximately $5B this year which are "account receivable"  &gt; Accounts receivable refer to the outstanding invoices that a company has or the money that clients owe the company. The phrase refers to accounts that a business has the right to receive because it has delivered a product or service.   https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivable.asp  Their AR is increasing every quarter which means they are lending out their products to customers . AR is negative for Revenue Recognition Practices: This situation might raise questions about the company's revenue recognition practices. There could be concerns about whether the company is aggressively recognizing revenue without a firm basis for believing the receivables will be collected.  So what's happening: NVDA is handing out products on credit to customers. There is no guarantee the revenue will materialize especially if the product is given on credit to startups that fail.   Historical Precedents: Dot-com Bubble: During the dot-com bubble, many companies reported high revenues but had equally high receivables. This was a red flag that revenues were being recognized aggressively without ensuring collectibility.   Million dollar question: Can you short it? NO.  The stock market is like a Quantum Mechanics. Observing it will change the outcome. That is, the stock market will ALWAYS move against retail bets. Do you feel like you are in a truman show where every play you make moves against you? That's because the stock market is designed algorithmically &amp; psychologically against the herd.   The market news (almost 100% of them are owned by hedge funds) and all the technical signals exist just to gas light you into playing a position that is guaranteed to lose.  This is not exclusive to NVDA. A huge chunk of companies reporting have significantly higher Account Receivable in their earning reports pumping up their ER.  But there is nothing you I can do.   It's all just the same thing over and over; we can't help ourselves. And you and I can't control it, or stop it, or even slow it. Or even ever-so-slightly alter it. We just react. And we make a lot money if we get it right. And we get left by the side of the side of the road if we get it wrong. And there have always been and there always will be the same percentage of winners and losers. Happy foxes and sad sacks. Fat cats and starving dogs in this world.

[$NVDA to $1500 via Gains, Trains, and AI-mobiles.,;,; ***Degenerates and regards,***  If you think its too late, its not. Everyone wants to see the stock plummet so their logical, "Its too high, overvalued, definitely going down" thought process can be validated. I can promise you one thing, nothing about this will ever make sense and everyone will reference this post 3 months from now. Bulls want hopium, Bears need copium, and Wall street bets is Dopium.  Buckle up, because I'm about to re-iterate  some truths about NVDA that'll make your dopamine receptors light up like a Christmas tree.  NVDA is destined to hit $1500, pre-split. Ignore current prices, ignore ratios, ignore the media, and listen:  1. **The AI Revolution (Obviously):**¬†NVDA is at the forefront of AI, by sheer luck. As our world becomes more intertwined with AI, Nvidia's dominance in providing chips and stuff for AI processing will be undeniable. 2. **Data Center Dominance:**¬†NVDA's data center segment is ready to explode. Demand for cloud computing and data processing is up, Nvidia has data centers filling a need in the market. 3. **Gaming Galore:**¬†Let's not forget about the gaming sector. NVDA's GPUs are known worldwide. As gaming continues to evolve and expand, Nvidia will continue to shine. Potentially aided Apple in the push to the virtual reality frontier. 4. **Autonomous Vehicles:**¬†Imagine Nvidia in cars, and self driving technology. Its already advanced but there is plenty of room to grow. 5. **Rising Revenue:**¬†Revenue growth speaks for itself. With consistent revenue increases year over year, Nvidia can thrive in any market. 6. **Profitability Powerhouse:**¬†Not only is Nvidia growing its revenue, but it's also raking in the profits. With impressive profit margins and a solid financial foundation, not to mention the stakes Nvidia holds in other companies which will profit in this AI boom. Think $SOUN, $RXRX. 7. **Innovation Incarnate:**¬†Nvidia's commitment to innovation is unparalleled. From cutting-edge GPU architectures to breakthroughs in AI research, Nvidia is  pushing the boundaries of what's possible in technology. Look it up, and see how far we've come in such a short time. 8. **Market Dominance:**¬†Market dominance is undeniable. 9. **Economic Expansion:**¬†As the global economy rebounds from recent challenges, obviously NVDA stands to benefit. With increased business activity and investment in technology infrastructure, its tendy town. 10. **The Wisdom of the Autists:**¬†And finally, let's not discount the wisdom of the autists on Wallstreetbets. With their unparalleled ability to sniff out tendies from miles away, the collective intelligence (sarcasm here) of the WSB community is a force to be reckoned with.  Too much hopium? Here is what could go wrong.   **Supply Chain Disruptions, Regulatory Issues (Pelosi wants to make money), Competition Intensification, Macroeconomic Factors (ie. the Crash Bears are praying for), and Technological Shifts (tech and companies come out of the woodwork all the time)**  You've heard this all before. But know this, NVDA isn't just a stock; it's a ticket to tendie town. Hedge funds, fellow WSB enthusiasts, and normal folk alike all want to be apart of this already meteoric rise . üöÄüåï Don't miss out on the single greatest investment since BTC.  Never learned how to read? Me either, Here's all you need to know. NVDA is undervalued and overvalued. People will tell you its going up and its going down. Bears, Bulls,  Battlestar Galactica.

[Stop saying "NVDA stonk high buy puts",;,; My fellow regards, I understand the natural inclination to feel as though a stock is overvalued when it's near its all time high - but you have to take a lot of things into account other than it's relative price. Deciding to yolo puts on NVDA because "stonk too high" is extremely regarded and reckless.  &amp;#x200B;  A few points:  1. NVDA is trading at a 113 P/E ratio, which is only 42 multiples above its average P/E. Considering the amount of news and hype this stock has been getting for the past 12 months, this is not even close to an unreasonable PE. 2. Besides current earnings, NVDA is on backorder for tens of thousands of H100 Cards, each retailing at at least **$33,000**, with aftermarket cards going for over $40,000. This demand/supply relationship gives Nvidia a lot of room to increase prices. Current demand estimates put the amount of H100's needed at 430,000 units. *That's just for the short term.* 3. Regardless of what you think about the long term outlook for AI, the reality is that corporations are fiending to integrate AI into their systems and consumer products. This demand is only increasing by the day and Nvidia has an estimated 70% of the AI chip market share.  &amp;#x200B;  Sure, I think NVDA may be due for a correction soon, but yoloing far OTM puts expiring in 30 days on a stock with this much growth and hype behind it is literally the definition of regarded.

[Clearest signs that NVDA will go higher after ER on 2/21,;,; Sure NVDA might dip 3-5% right after on "sell the news" bullshit but it will rebound and go much higher the weeks and months after. I doubt it dips that much though. More likely, it will jump 3-5% the next day. Here are the clearest signs why this will happen:  * Every dip in the last 2 weeks have been bought. It dipped to 699 the day hot CPI was released and now it's above 730. Look at the 5 day chart. It's an ascending triangle. * Analysts have been raising PT to above 800 in the last week. EVERY SINGLE analyst has raised PT. These firms will defend their positions by scooping up shares if there's a dip. * Whales (Druck, Bridewater, etc.) have not sold out of their huge ass positions. Druck has 500 mill in NVDA. * The sentiment from CNBC to WSB is "I'll sell before ER and lock in gains." All those sells are happening this week and the stock hasn't folded. It's building a base above 700. * FB, MSFT, SMCI, TSM....all have guided higher capex and rev for next Q. There hasn't been a single "We see slower build out for our AI stacks next quarter." Edit: AMAT just blew away their numbers on "strong AI chip demand".  IMO: NVDA blows top and bottom numbers out of the waters (23B rev &amp; $5 EPS) and guides much higher for next Q and full year.

For riches come and riches go, and with them tales of heaven and hell.  Once upon a time, in the land of Btfdville, there was a bold bear. He went by Rizzly, for it seemed the markets favored his every move. He believed he had charmed the capricious mistress of fortune, gracefully doing the tango with she who is known as the cruel mistress herself. Word of his astute short-selling abilities spread like wildfire, and soon he was the talk of the town. What also gave him hella clout was his savage remarks regarding his stock market activities.  "The only thing sweeter than honey is shorting regional bank stocks to the ground". "Why is it that when stocks go DOWN, my PP go UP?" ‚ÄúIdk whats falling harder, the bulls' dignity, your wife's panties, the Titanic or this stock I just shorted".  Wherever he went , "off colour" remarks were expressed.  At the 5 star Michelin restaurant he could now afford going to, he told the waitress: I'll take a juicy bull steak and a stock that I can mercilessly crush into oblivion, thank you. And the drink? Shareholder tears, on the rocks plz". At the funeral of his aunt, Mama Bear: "This stock l'm shorting is deader than her. It'll join my aunt, Harambe, and  FRC in the afterlife shortly. Load up on puts, trust me bro". At his wedding to Burry: "I take you as my beloved spouse, to have and to hold, and to mercilessly short stocks with, until profit do us part. As we embark on this bearish journey, let us unite our portfolios and short investment thesis".  In Rizzley's hometown of Btfdville, most ppl were chill. Being a bull was the status quo while being a bear was a no go. Rizzley always felt that this was unfair, which is why the bulls' ego he wanted to tear. Rizzley, always a contrarian at heart, wanted to break their illusion apart. He prowled the investing landscape for the most robust stock, seeking the bulls' cherished gem among the flock. Lo and behold  Nvidia,bursting with buying pressure and bullish charisma. Rizzley found his target, and set about to make the stock bleed red like Target. He wrote various DD's on WSB, spamming the post with meteor emojis ‚òÑÔ∏è‚òÑÔ∏è‚òÑÔ∏è. Rizzley put up his short thesis flyers in various places in Btfdville, the parks, stop signs, Wendy's, even on the traffic lights' red circle üî¥ . He married his brother to the Hindenburg Research CIO. He shared his rationale to various renowned publications of his town, such as the Grizzly Gazzete, Regarded Writings and Crayon Chronicles. He even released a book, "The Bear's Den: Where Optimism Goes to Hibernate". In it, he was quoted as saying "bulls are like ostriches with their heads in the sand. They refuse to see the truth. All of this Al talk is hype lol. They'll learn soon enough, the hard way hopefully".  Convinced NVIDIA would fall, and WSB's bearish echo chamber bolstering his appetite, he went all in on NDA puts. He sold everything he had, including himself (worked extra shifts behind Wendy's dumpster). Believing this play wouldn't go tits up, he decided to hibernate. When he will wake up, he'd be richer than Jordan Belfort in 98‚Äô. After 69 days, he rose from his slumber, first thing he did is look at Lambos and was stuck on what color.

[A Case Against the NVDA AI Bubble Theory,;,; Tons of bears in this sub pushing the idea that we're going to have a massive AI bubble pop on a similar level to the dot com bubble and they don't know what they're talking about. Just my two cents coming from a degree in computer engineering, not a psychic but am highly regarded by my wife's boyfriend.  Yes there are a ton of AI startups that will all buy NVDA hardware then do nothing worthwhile and crash and burn just like a ton of new internet companies during the dot com bubble let's just pretend for a second thats the same thing even though it's not.  In this scenario NVDA is basically 90s Cisco. An internet backbone company that exploded in market cap then never really recovered after the dot com crash. This is real wrong. The hardware and infrastructure Cisco was doing at the time was ahead of the game but it wasn't stuff that other companies couldn't also do with enough time, money, and manpower.  The complexity of internet backbone tech is nothing in comparison to GPU architecture. Internet tech scaling is just all about finding ways to push more data around the world faster and more securely. Websites don't really get much better over time they just look visually more appealing and load faster. GPU tech scaling is running increasingly more intelligent AI, mining crypto that becomes infinitely harder to mine over time and thus requires more and faster GPUs, and powering graphical software that only increases in complexity every year with movies and video games and VR and whatever other new graphical tech the world comes up with holograms or some shit idk.  The world has a very finite number of highly skilled hardware engineers. Universities shit out the IT and CS guys who work in internet related companies by the truckload. It is so much less complex to design a website or a database or a router or even some big giant server cluster or a cell tower or whatever software thing than what goes into designing and producing a new family of GPUs.  The best companies to invest in are hard to imitate and can just keep designing new products and improving on old ones for as far into the future as you can imagine that's how green line go up and that's exactly what a company like NVDA is.

[NVDA stock will split and wont crash.,;,; Im taking the contrarian view.  Just about everyone on WSB thinks the stock is overvalued. And at the moment by current standards it is. But the company will grow into the valuation as the earning keep going up quarter over quarter.  The market is forward looking.  Tesla was also in this same position in 2021 and 2022. Everyone thought that the stock was way over valued for a car company and had a PE that was unreasonable. TSLA never crashed. It did drop because of Elon selling but that was a special circumstance, had nothing to do with the fundamentals. Tesla even ended up splitting multiple times.  NVDA is gold standard of AI. Demand far exceeds supply. The stock will split when it reaches $700, not crash.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-08-23 15:39:55]
[NVDA undervalued?,;,; I just lost of money on NVIDIA but think the Stock is undervalued. Hear me out. Yes NVDA is expensive but *relative* to the market and considering its extraordinary growth its actually not too bad. Add to this the fact that demand is only going to increase as businesses are spending looking to incorporate generative ai . I know for a fact that for example Amazon plans to use it in every facet of their businesses and every AWS team is requesting additional hardware. This is probably true for many enterprise customers. In addition there are jobs like customer service which are likely to be automated or at least slashed because of this and this too require more gpus. Unlike most people, I feel like while there is too much talk of gen ai, its going to be an important part of the economy moving forward and that Nvidia is in a uniquely good position to profit from it.

Miners costs are set in dollars (electricty) so some miners should be going under, lessening the demand for chips.  Add in China recently poo pooing NVDAs dumbed down AI chips and there shouldn't be any reason for NVDA to be rocketing right now other than shorts are being squeezed.

People don't realize Abercrombie is essentially a different company than what existed in the 2000s/2010s. In 2017, they hired a new CEO who shifted the brand and product line away from the preppy-dude aesthetic to a different trend.  That trend is the resale/vintage/thrifting aesthetic ‚Äî and it's fucking booming. Do a quick search on tiktok to see what Gen Z wears these days and you'll notice they all look like they came out of a fucking Seinfeld episode. This is happening partly because fashion is cyclical but also because Gen Z is just  more environmentally-conscious, so they don't want to see a bunch of clothes end up in a landfill. If you wanna look at the macro, [there's projections that the resale market will reach $70B by 2027](https://cf-assets-tup.thredup.com/resale_report/2023/thredUP_2023_Resale_Report_FINAL.pdf).  This is why Abercrombie is doing so well ‚Äî because they shifted their entire catalogue and brand to focus on just this. Other major clothing brands couldn't because they would cannibalize their non-vintage catalogues (i.e. innovator's dilemma). Yes, recently major brands have started carrying vintage-looking clothes, but there's a difference between walking in a store and having to dig for an aesthetic vs everything being the aesthetic you want.  That's what Abercrombie took advantage of. They were positioned to do it because their brand was already in the shitter. And this is why so many young people shop there these days (seriously look it up on tiktok).  My position: Bought some ANF 6 weeks ago and I'm up 30%.  Edit: u/___fofo___ called me a big fat idiot because I didn't tell you all before. That's fair. But earnings are coming up March 6.

In fact, here is why I say they have already outburnt their rocket!   Look at the list below.    there are only 5 companies at the $1T club, and number 6 and 7 are fighting their asses off to get in. now lets talk about ALL of them, and why NVDA isn't one of them:     1. MSFT has just this week gained supremacy and passed AAPL. There's no argue why MSFT is one of the top 5 companies in the world. They control more than 60% of all OS on all computers on the entire planet, they have access to us all with their products, and they control 22% of could services world wide with Azure. billions of users world wide uses products they 100% own, and profit of with no middleman anywhere. That's dominancy! That's not talking about LinkedIn which is considered to be the best professional social network, and they sure as fuck monetize this. 2. AAPL since they dropped Intel's processors for the M1 and later M2, they control end-to-end of their production process and have roughly 50% market share of wealthy users world wide, plus 26% of mobile users globally. Not sure if they truly invented it, but they have perfected the subscription profit model, and controlling the spending of their huge users base fiercely! And I bet there's a hidden report out there showing they control the majority of the top dome of socio-economic group. BTW a friend of mine working as senior full stack at MSFT told me they gave him a MacBook when he started working for Microsoft. He's developing MS-Office on a MacBook!!!!!  3. Saudi-Aramco - I know shit about them, but they control oceans of oil and you know.... oil is oil 4. Google - 98% market share for online searches. plus, over 70% global market share of mobile OS and 12% share of  cloud service. All in-house and 100% owned by Google. Oh yeah, and don't forget about Youtube. Oh BTW - do you drive much? did you know that to avoid competition, Google bought Waze too? 5. AMZN - Well to be honest, I don't believe they have a strong valuable market place anymore and I am pessimistic about their retailing now days. In fact I heard somewhere (and I can't find it now) that they lost almost $10B on their forward sellings in 2022, BUT!!!! they earned over $20B off advertising on site which covers the returns and customer's care. we can argue about that, but we can't argue about the crown jewel of AMZN - AWS!!!! 33% of all data on could, is located on an AWS server. You know NFLX, DIS, and WBD streaming services? Along with Amazon prime, they are all located on the same fucking servers!!!! In fact, unless you're watching Youtube or AppleTV, if you're watching streamers, you're watching it off an AWS server!  6. NVDA - let's roll back to it later 7. Meta - I do hate that evil empire, but there's no argue that there's no other company with as much user data as they have. Between Instagram, Facebook, whatsapp - if you want to talk or meet someone, it's probably through one of their platforms, and they monitor it. 8. Tesla - I hate Elon! I think he should be in jail for violating at least 10 SEC regulations. But he's still out there and roaming. I won't argue that TSLA is A-Z solution to car manufacturing. Everything is In-house as well, and the marketing expenses are 0!!! But in a world where everybody are looking for autonomous vehicles, Elon's got the most data collected in the world. When they talked about creating a center control for autonomous driving, they suggested Tesla will be the center since they have the biggest data centers dedicated for it.   &amp;#x200B;  Now lets get back to NVDA - 10 years ago, they were nothing. A great product for a special segment of hardcore computer users willing to spend $200-$500 on hardware no one else even knows needed.   Back then Intel was God and AMD tried biting on them. But got no where close.    Then AI kicked in, and engineers found out GPU are better to teach the modules rather than CPU and guess who's the best GPU manufacturer? wait no!!! It's not NVDA! They have never manufactured a single processor. They don't have a single factory. They do it all with TSMC (number 11 on the list, but around 1/3 the value on NVDA).   Ok so they have the best design. Fuck!!! no they don't!! They use ARM technology to design their processors ($74B market cap). And why ARM are so important? well because couple months ago, NVDA wanted to buy them, so the US regulator looked this deal up, and found out these 2 companies are the only 2 companies to design such technologies and by buying them, NVDA will basically eliminate the competition, and be a full monopoly on ARM architecture processors. so how come one company is worth $74B and the other $1.4T??? because they design the best AI training processors.  WAIT!!!! FUCK they don't!!!!! haven't you heard?? AMD just steamrolled them with Frontier ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier\_(supercomputer)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_(supercomputer)))     AMD has had the best week in their life!! how good? $250B good. That's still 1/6 of NVDA.   And wait, I mentioned Intel several times before, but what's the deal with them? Well in a nut shell, they have dragged behind. They used to have an enormous market share of processors in the market and they got cocky and neglected R&amp;D while the rest rushed to innovate. But even though you are probably reading this on an Intel based computer, or have one at work/home, and they used to be the sole suppliers for Apple computers, Intel at it's peak was worth $273B (Jan 31st 2020). Still fraction of NVDA's worth. And in opposed to NVDA, ARM and AMD - Intel has always owned their own factories, meaning their worth should combine NVDA and TSMC together!!!!  So the question remains - WTF??????       &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/5xbjatheg8dc1.jpg?width=1036&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4564c4053a764084a6dfca02474ce66d606225c7,;,; 2024-01-18 18:27:58]
[Is Nvidia Overvalued? AVGO Boasts 62% Higher Net Income than NVDA, Yet with a 65% Lower Market Cap?,;,; In the rapidly evolving world of technology, NVIDIA has emerged as a leading player in the semiconductor industry. Known for its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the company has garnered significant attention from investors. However, in the current economic environment, there are growing concerns that NVIDIA‚Äôs stock may be overvalued. This article delves into various factors, including economic indicators, company fundamentals and comparable examples , to provide a comprehensive analysis of why NVIDIA‚Äôs stock valuation may be inflated.   As a cyclical stock, the global economy plays a crucial role in determining the performance and valuation of a company like NVIDIA. Considering economic indicators such as GDP growth rates showing signs of moderation, reflecting a potential slowdown in overall economic activity. Additionally, inflationary pressures and interest rate adjustments have introduced uncertainties into the market. These factors can impact investor sentiment and the valuation of companies, including NVIDIA.  To evaluate NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation, we need to examine its fundamental aspects. The company‚Äôs financial profile reveals key information:  Examining NVIDIA‚Äôs quarterly income statement reveals a mix of sales growth and decline over the past five quarters. The most recent quarter, ending on April 30, 2023, saw a substantial increase in sales with a growth rate of 18.86%. However, the preceding quarters experienced more varied results, including modest growth, a decline, and a significant drop in sales.  These fluctuations in sales growth suggest that NVIDIA‚Äôs revenue stream may not be consistently expanding. Such volatility can impact the company‚Äôs overall valuation, especially when combined with the high P/E ratio of 219.84 mentioned earlier. Investors should be cautious when evaluating the stock‚Äôs current valuation, considering the mixed performance shown in the income statement.  	1.	Market Capitalization: NVIDIA‚Äôs market cap stands at a staggering $1.04 trillion, highlighting its prominence in the market. However, a high market cap alone does not guarantee that a stock is fairly valued. 	2.	Earnings Per Share (EPS): NVIDIA‚Äôs EPS for the most recent fiscal year was reported at $1.92. While this figure appears solid, a deeper analysis is necessary to assess its significance in relation to the stock‚Äôs valuation. 	3.	Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: The P/E ratio for NVIDIA is an eye-opening 219.84, indicating a substantial premium investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. A high P/E ratio could suggest overvaluation if not adequately supported by other factors.  To assess NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation further, it is prudent to compare the company‚Äôs financial indicators to those of its competitors within the semiconductor sector, namely AMD, Micron, and AVGO.  AMD, with an EPS of 0.24 and a market capitalization of $183.44 billion, exhibits a notably lower valuation compared to NVIDIA. However, the semiconductor industry‚Äôs current fame and widespread recognition may contribute to inflated valuations across the sector.  Micron‚Äôs negative EPS of -2.68 and market capitalization of $69.12 billion indicate weaker financial performance when compared to NVIDIA and AMD. As a result, Micron may not serve as an accurate benchmark for evaluating NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation.  AVGO, another prominent player in the semiconductor sector, boasts a healthy EPS of 31.64 and a P/E ratio of 27.41. With a market capitalization of $357.98 billion, AVGO appears to be favorably valued relative to its earnings, further highlighting the need for careful evaluation within the semiconductor sector.  Comparing AVGO‚Äôs Annual Income Statement with NVDA‚Äôs provides valuable insights into the financial performance of both companies:  AVGO Annual Income Statement:  	‚Ä¢	2022 Sales/Revenue: $33,203 million 	‚Ä¢	2022 Net Income: $11,495 million  NVDA Annual Income Statement:  	‚Ä¢	2023 Sales/Revenue: $26,974 million 	‚Ä¢	2023 Net Income: $4,368 million  Looking at the revenue figures, AVGO has consistently shown higher sales/revenue over the past five years. In 2022, AVGO reported sales of $33,203 million, while NVDA reported sales of $26,974 million.  In terms of net income, AVGO has also demonstrated strong performance. In 2022, AVGO reported a net income of $11,495 million, indicating robust profitability. On the other hand, NVDA reported a net income of $4,368 million in 2023, which is notably lower than AVGO‚Äôs net income.  These figures suggest that AVGO has consistently outperformed NVDA in terms of both revenue and net income. The higher revenue and stronger profitability of AVGO further reinforce the argument that NVIDIA may be overvalued when compared to AVGO.  Taking into account the prevailing economic challenges and the potential impact on the semiconductor sector, there are indications that NVIDIA‚Äôs current valuation may be inflated. The semiconductor industry, including NVIDIA, has gained significant attention due to its critical role in emerging technologies and the ongoing digital revolution. However, widespread recognition and market enthusiasm can contribute to elevated valuations.  Given the factors discussed above, including the mixed sales growth, high P/E ratio, and comparisons to industry peers, there is a compelling case to suggest that NVIDIA‚Äôs stock may experience a sharp price decline in the near future. The current economic environment, with signs of a slowdown in overall economic activity and uncertainties surrounding inflation and interest rates, adds further weight to this analysis.  While the company‚Äôs prominence in the semiconductor industry is undeniable, the potential for overvaluation cannot be overlooked. The market cap of $1.04 trillion alone does not guarantee fair valuation, and the EPS and P/E ratio indicate a premium investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.  While the stock has enjoyed significant attention and growth, there are indications that it is overvalued. In conclusion, it is crucial for investors to assess NVIDIA‚Äôs stock valuation critically, taking into account the economic landscape, company fundamentals, and industry trends.,;,; 2023-07-02 15:43:59]

[NVDA is the wrong bet on AI,;,; So right now NVDA is trading on a billion percent of earnings, on the thesis that generative AI is the future of every industry, and NVDA makes the chips which make generative AI possible.  This is wrong and here's why.  Don't get me wrong NVDA is a great company.  They make industry-leading products, and they have been extremely savvy in getting industries like AI/ML and the gaming market to become dependent on their proprietary technologies.  They always seem to be one step ahead in embedding themselves the most important industries, for a long enough time that it's hard to say this could be an accident.  I'm also not an AI naysayer.  I'm not sure if it will live up to the hype, but it's entirely possible that generative AI will be a transformative technology which will change our lives for decades to come.  But the current NVDA valuation seems to imply that NVDA will maintain it's current defacto monopoly on AI hardware into perpetuity, and that is simply unlikely.  The only reason NVDA currently dominates is because they own CUDA, which most of the software backing AI relies on.  But there's nothing magic about CUDA which will prevent generative AI models to be trained and run on other hardware eventually, when the software catches up.  And you can be sure every other chip maker is working hard to make this happen.  Google already has their own proprietary AI hardware which by some reports is more efficient than NVDA's A100's and H100's.  So NVDA has a lead, but if generative AI proves to be the cash-cow that it promises to be, other chip makers will surely elbow their way into the market and eat some of NVDA's lunch.  So enjoy those juicy returns while you can.  Heck, I'm even an NVDA holder myself since the days when it was under $100, but the current valuation is just not based in reality.  Imo if AI is indeed the play, the smart money long term is on cloud providers, who are going to be the ones renting out time on AI hardware which will increasingly exist as a commodity item, and chip makers like NVDA and AMD will be forced to trim margins to fight for space in data centers.,;,; 2023-09-01 11:36:04]

I jumped in (cost basis $150.79) because of her setup. I was unaware of *both* the price target increases and the news.  But when I researched her, I found the news. So, I shared it on the daily *(link below)* with good intentions.  I didn't think it would make her go 8%, which is why I didn't place a WSB ban bet on her. Damn.  Now, I know I'm a flairless random user here, but you should know I don't care about AMD or specific catalysts or being right or earning clout. I care about making money, and I did very well here today.  I'm writing this to update anyone who played AMD or is by any means being influenced by the info I shared: **That catalyst is not the main reason that's moving AMD.**  Nonetheless, I'm leaving the post up because the news could still work as a catalyst.   Heck, the discussions among the Committee Chairmen working on that tax relief bill might have still influenced somehow. But the bottom line is it's not the main catalyst *today*.  Sorry for the inconvenience.\]  &amp;#x200B;  [I posted it soon after the market opened](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1980b40/comment/ki4mgff/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) (09:40 ET), but you guys downvoted the comment.

Earlier today:  &gt;House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (MO-08) and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-OR) announced a common sense, bipartisan, bicameral tax framework that promotes the financial security of working families, boosts growth and American competitiveness, and strengthens communities and Main Street businesses.  That tax framework is called The Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024, and it includes a section: Expands Innovation and Competitiveness with Pro-Growth Economic Policies.  That section includes the **Taiwan double tax relief.**  &gt;\[to\] strengthen America‚Äôs competitive position with China by **removing the current double taxation that exists for businesses and workers with a footprint in both the United States and Taiwan**.  Taiwan is a semiconductor powerhouse. Therefore, removing double taxation for businesses with a footprint in both the U.S. and Taiwan will benefit semiconductor companies with ties with both countries.

[Is there potential to short NVDA?,;,;  I was taking a look at the general semiconductor industry and was surprised by the metrics of NVDA. The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years.   I also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning.  I do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows. However this valuation seems obscene and reminds me a lot of NVDA before the big sell of from its former valuation at similar levels.  Seems that going short through ITM or ATM long dated puts seems legitimate. What do you guys think?,;,; 2023-05-19 04:09:56]
[Nvidia reminds me of Cisco during dotcom.,;,; **Note**: This post is *descriptive* of my personal observations and is for discussion purposes only. It is neither *predictive* in what will happen next nor is it *prescriptive* in suggesting any course of investment actions.   I've only done [3 predictive posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/s/pAtSiWhCXo) on this sub and this won't be one of them.  For those who are too young to remember that time:  There was this new thing called "the Internet", and it was going to forever change the world (it eventually did), and every company that hypes up some sort of "internet tech" (could be simple landing page that sells stuff, i.e Pets.com) received sky high valuation.   And there was one company behind it that made it all possible: Cisco, the company that sells industrial routers and switches to telecom providers that power the backbone of the entire internet infrastructure, was *obviously* a company that was "selling shovels during a gold rush" and would take over the whole world.   Its share price went up 236% from Jan.1999 to March 2000, reached a valuation of $500B+ (record high for a company back then), P/E went through the roof but it didn't matter because the *Internet Revolution^TM* was *just beginning* (and it was), so naturally Cisco's share price could only go higher.  The cherry on the top was that back then the **top two** companies were *Microsoft* and *Cisco*, one would provide the software (**Internet Explorer baby!**) and the other would sell the hardware. Together they would rule the world!  Now if you replace "Internet" with "AI", and "Cisco" with "Nvidia", keep Microsoft as it is (but replace "IE" with ChatGPT"), and we have quite a mirror version of what's happening today.  Then we all know what happened. Cisco obviously survived the bubble burst and remains profitable and is still doing fine today, but $CSCO *never* recovered back to its dotcom bubble peak after crashing 80% during the dotcom bust, 23 years later.  Now will the same thing happen with $NVDA? Like I said I don't know and I'm not making any predictions. All I can say is that I see a lot of parallels *so far*.  **Edit**: For people replying to me arguing how you can't mine Bitcoins using network switches or how Cisco didn't do AI, *no kidding*, at no point did I claim the two companies are identical and sell the same things, that would be idiotic.  All I am saying is the *hype*, *expectation*, and *position* of these two companies in their respective backdrop, are *similar* to each other.,;,; 2024-01-11 08:39:35]
[Nvidia shares spike 26% on huge forecast beat driven by A.I. chip demand,;,; https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2024.html  Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings for its fiscal 2024 on Wednesday, with a stronger-than-expected forecast that drove shares up 26% in extended trading.  Here's how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates for the quarter ended in April:  EPS: $1.09, adjusted, versus 92 cents expected Revenue: $7.19 billion, versus $6.52 billion expected Nvidia said it expected sales of about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the current quarter, more than 50% higher than Wall Street estimates of $7.15 billion.  Prior to the after-hours move, Nvidia stock was up 109% so far in 2023, mostly driven by optimism stemming from the company's leading position in the market for artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was seeing "surging demand" for its data center products.  Nvidia's data center group reported $4.28 billion in sales, versus expectations of $3.9 billion, a 14% annual increase. Nvidia said that performance was driven by demand for its GPU chips from cloud vendors as well as large consumer internet companies, which use Nvidia chips to train and deploy generative AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.  Nvidia's strong performance in data center shows that AI chips are becoming increasingly important for cloud providers and other companies that run large numbers of servers.  However, Nvidia's gaming division, which includes the company's graphics cards for PC sales, reported a 38% drop in revenue to $2.24 billion in sales versus expectations of $1.98 billion. Nvidia blamed the decline on a slower macroeconomic environment as well as the ramp up of the company's latest GPUs for gaming.  Nvidia's automotive division, including chips and software to develop self-driving cars, grew 114% year over year, but remains small at under $300 million in sales for the quarter.  Net income for the quarter was $2.04 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with $1.62 billion, or 64 cents, during the year-earlier period. Nvidia's overall sales fell 13% from $8.29 billion a year ago.  *Personal take*: I don‚Äôt even know what to say, this is simply astonishing. The AFH price puts NVDA at 20% above its previous ATH. This jump would have been insane even for 2021, let alone the tech market of 2023.  AI will be the main focus and the main buzzword for the entire tech industry for the next few years, and I expect many companies to pivot toward that one way or another (even if it‚Äôs just paying PR lip service) in order to catch the wind in the sail.,;,; 2023-05-25 02:13:21]
[How far behind Nvidia is AMD?,;,; From what I‚Äôve read, Nvidia‚Äôs only real competitors, for now, are AMD and Intel. Intel handles manufacturing, whereas AMD is fabless like Nvidia, so AMD is a much closer competitor in terms of business model and product offering.  Admittedly, I am pretty unfamiliar with the technical elements of semiconductors, but I understand demand for AMD chips is nowhere close to that of Nvidia‚Äôs, and market share in advanced chips will be skewed toward Nvidia for at least a few years.  Those of you with a better understanding of chip tech and the semiconductor industry: Is it likely just a matter of time before AMD catches up, or is there something fundamental missing from AMD‚Äôs products that puts Nvidia ahead for the foreseeable future?,;,; 2023-08-27 13:28:29]
[Nvidia launches custom chip business,;,; Nvidia is launching a custom chip business to capture cloud, automotive, telecom and other segments of custom chip opportunities.

They will proliferated their CUDA software ecosystem ensuring a broader foot print for their platform.  4. Broad relationships with supply chains -- they will become king maker for the next SuperMicro -- on the chip level, 5. Nvidia pioneered use of AI in chip design, so it's a logical adjacent segment.  They're aiming at limiting guys like Broadcom and Marvel in the semicustom space.  AMD also has a semicustom chip business.  "Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon.com, Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for them, according to two sources familiar with the meetings. Beyond data center chips, the company has pursued telecom, automotive and video game customers.  In 2022, Nvidia said it would let third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking technology with their own chips."  Would also note one early customer identified:  "Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics processing unit (GPU) technology, according to two sources familiar with the talks.

[Nvidia - cash out profits and buy an ETF or hold?,;,; Nvidia releases earnings on 2/21. There doesn't seem to be a consensus what the stock will do, especially given the fact that the price doesn't really seem to be tied to traditional valuations. I currently have over 300 shares, mostly long-term with a gain of almost 700%. I'm 52 and looking to retire in about 8 years, with an overall net worth (including house) of over $2.5M. Most of my net worth is in a 401k, but I have a significant amount tied up in stocks, with Nvidia now representing over 30% of my total stock holdings (not including 401k).  I've been considering cashing out a chunk of Nvidia and just putting it in an ETF like VOO to insulate me a bit from any potential massive down-tick in the stock. Unfortunately, most of the ETFs are also heavily invested in the "Magnificent 7" stocks, which includes Nvidia. I've also been trying to figure out what a good "break-even" type point would be, if I cashed out and took a 20% capital gains hit (federal + state) and how much the stock would need to drop for me to buy back in at a more reasonable price.

[Some historical perspective on Nvidia's valuation,;,; As we all know, Nvidia jumped 25% in a day on Thursday, one of the [largest single day](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-25/nvidia-nvda-on-track-for-record-219-billion-surge-in-market-value) market cap gains in history. Now up ~175% YTD, in a market that has rallied strongly since the start of the year, with AI being the hot new thing, there is talks of Nvidia (and AI in general) being a bubble. That Nvidia is overvalued.  But I want to point this out: despite the 25% jump in price this week, NVDA shares actually got **cheaper** on a forward P/E basis.  https://i.imgur.com/xPQR2OF.png  Prior to the report, it was traded at ~60x forward earnings. After the report, it trades at ~50x. And that 50x is only ~1 standard deviation away from it's 5 year average range.  This relative valuation holds for pretty much every metric  https://i.imgur.com/iMejuuf.png  Relative to it's peers, Nvidia, despite the massive single day jump, doesn't trade much more than above it's historical average.  https://i.imgur.com/4nP2u9w.png  Why is this? Because in hindsight, analyst expectations were somehow *too low*.  One year forward revenue grew from ~$30B to ~$40B, a 33% jump  Two year forward revenue went from ~$37B to ~$50B, a 35% jump  One year forward EPS went from ~$4.55 to ~$7, a 55% jump  Two year forward EPS went from ~$6.50 to ~$9.60, a 46% jump  2025 operating profit expectations a week ago were $16.6B. After reporting, now $27B  Forward gross margins went from 67.5% to 70.5%  Forward free cash flow went from $11.4B to $20.4B  I know it sounds like beating a dead horse here, but Nvidia just gave guidance that is them screaming that a transformational change is incoming.  Will the stock continue to keep going up every day? Of course not. But the calls of Nvidia being overvalued based simply on price action is ignoring the fundamental shift.,;,; 2023-05-27 23:33:44]

[[D] The Question facing Nvidia,;,; The problem this stock faces is no one knows how to value it.  The company are investing in technology that opens up new markets (AI, Omniverse and self driving for example).  Will those markets pan out or will they go bust?  And if they do pan out, what's the value of those markets?    Nobody knows, these markets haven't been served before.  Today's share price is a reflection of the market sentiment, the voting machine's results as of this moment.   The current share price is either grossly over extended or grossly undervalued -- there is no in between in my opinion.  I believe Nvidia has cemented itself as the hardware technology leadership company of the era, much like IBM and Intel of past decades.   Some on Wall St understand this, others are coming to understand it.  But there are many who doubt that is the case as well.  The most obvious question from doubters is about competition:  Won't AMD or Intel or Google or Apple just come in with better technology and take their position?  I've been invested in this company for more than 15 years and what they do uniquely are two things:  1.  Strategize and 2.  Execute.   They have been building a GPGPU platform (General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit), otherwise known as "accelerated computing" since about 2007.   It's different from standard CPUs in that it processes massive amounts of data in parallel, tens of thousands of "cores" operating at the same time.  Their platform is a combination of inter-generational compatible hardware and software.  The platform is robust, reliable, well supported, offers regular performance improvements, and is now ubiquitous with over 4million developers using it including nearly every AI developer on the planet.  So when a competitor comes to throw their hat in the ring, there is an enormous defensive position to overcome that includes a large user base who are getting reliable, quantifiable and predictable results.    Since 2014 predictions of Nvidia's demise in the data center have been constant from both mammoth technology companies (AMD, Intel, Google, Baidu) and startups alike.    But no one has been able to make a real dent in Nvidia's momentum and share -- not with CPUs, ASICs, FPGAs or any other technology.  In their core area of AI model training, Nvidia has between 85-95% market share depending on whose numbers you look at.   They are serving this with the largest, most complex mass produced semiconductor devices man can imagine.  What about other GPUs?   GPUs have proven an excellent solution for the job, they are readily available, flexible and performant.  AMD and Intel are building new GPUs and pursuing as " AI is their number 1 priority."  I expect these companies to pick up some business simply because Nvidia cannot service 100% of the demand they are creating.  But these well-regarded companies have a difficult hill to climb in software.  They need to make their products work as well as Nvidia's to be competitive, if they don't they will likely sell at a deep discount.  A "real" competitive offering will have to exceed Nvidia's solution in both performance and ease of use.   I haven't seen that sort of competitor surface in the past 10 years, nor can I see one on the horizon.  There may be one lurking -- certainly a possibility -- but it will take 2-4 years minimum for that type of solution to come to market.   In the mean time, Nvidia is out re-architecting data centers with AI-centric chip solutions:  CPUs, GPUs, DPUs and networking and switching technology.  They continue to raise the bar for competitors.  Soon data center processing will be managed by AI techniques to yield better, faster, more power efficient results sooner.     Nvidia owns data center acceleration -- the nexus of AI -- for the near term.  Is AI a real technology that has launched and will add value to human kind in innumerable ways, or does it sputter and fizzle into another "AI winter" from whence Nvidia becomes a footnote in history?   That is the question on this company's share price.  FPE, PS, DCF ?  These are just irrelevant metrics in this context.,;,; 2023-05-18 17:39:57]

I don't think other big tech (Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS) giants will order more GPUs because running a general-purpose GPU is very expensive: [Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company. Each query costs roughly 4 cents, according to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/)   Google already has its own ASICs chips called TPU.    Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family.      Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.  And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers.     Small businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud capacities (mostly Google because of their TPU's low power-to-cost ratio).      The rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent.      **\[Conclusions\]:** Their a moderate-low probability Q4 revenues will reach a plateau of around 15-20 billion.  A moderate probability that they will be below 15 billion. A low probability of exceeding 20 billion.  &amp;#x200B;  ***Let's sidestep to AI marker TAM topic,***        [*Meanwhile, looking forward to 2027, the server market's value is estimated at a staggering $195.6 billion.*](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-ai-and-hpc-gpu-sales-reportedly-approached-half-a-million-units-in-q3-thanks-to-meta-facebook)   However, this estimated revenue will be brought by those who rent AI processing capacities like AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud providers. And not ChatGPT clones. The market has not figured yet the TAM (total addressable market) of services like ChatGPT.

[The average cost of 1 query from a used is 4 cents](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/).     A single user runs 2,000 queries per month on average. The query is a single text message you send to the chatbot.      2000 \* 0.04 = 80 $ to service 1 user per month.    Until the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month.    No wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription.  It doesn't seem sustainable.

[[D] Nvidia valuation - how do you see it?,;,; Three months ago, I postulated here [The problem this stock faces is no one knows how to value it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/13l5gc0/d_the_question_facing_nvidia/)  Nvidia today delivered GAAP 46% net income on $13.5B and guided significantly above best street whisper estimates ($14B) to $16B/qtr.  Their FPE moved significantly down from 58 -- there is an argument at $500/sh next 12mos FPE could be under 30 (EPS of $18/sh), but we can wait for the analysts numbers for a more accurate calculation.  Either way, explosive growth like this seems unprecedented in modern times.  I described the company's management, execution, about their strategy, and argued in the above link and how Nvidia has little in the way of competition.    They seemingly own Infrastructure for the next generation of computing, AI, and they are delivering on the promise.  70%GMs, a clear runway littered with fat margin dollars waiting to be scooped up, and no one giving any kind of meaningful challenge.

[AMD's AI Push: Can the New MI300 Series Compete with Nvidia in the Booming AI Chip Market?,;,; AMD's new AI chips are designed to compete with Nvidia's H100 family, and the company has been open about its intentions to challenge its rival. Analysts expect Nvidia's annual revenue to surpass $108 billion by the end of 2025, highlighting the enormous growth potential in the AI chip market.        The company's focus on developing advanced AI solutions, as evidenced by the launch of the MI300 Series, demonstrates its commitment to staying competitive in the rapidly growing AI industry. The positive analyst feedback and collaborations with industry leaders suggest that AMD is well-positioned to capitalize on the substantial potential of the AI chip market.        Shares of AMD fell -1.7% on the day of the event. The weakness could be chalked up to broader market weakness as equities, and semiconductors in particular, were under selling pressure. The stock slipped to $116 in late afternoon trade and closed below its 20-sma. Shares have rebounded today, rallying 9% on the session as the stock blasts back above the 20-sma ($120.25).

[1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,;,; I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio.  As a recap, I bought several ‚Äòpandemic stocks‚Äô following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)  I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold.  Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss.  **Summary**  There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I‚Äôve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3:  * Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% * Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% * Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% * Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% * Peloton (PTON): -71.51% * Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99%  All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD).  I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I‚Äôd like to maintain some anonymity around it.  Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme).  **How I reinvested the proceeds**  The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA).  This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at \~$110/share in October 2022 (I don‚Äôt know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023.  Most analysts said it was overpriced and it‚Äôd have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation.  However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/). So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC).

[20 stocks till 2049 - buy and hold for 25 years,;,; Hello. Apologies if this has already been posted in this community.   I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.  https://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e  The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.  So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold.   So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049.   Here is my list so far.   1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 ) 2. Costco 3. Johnson and Johnson 4. Waste Management 5. CVS 6. Home Depot 7. Boeing 8. Caterpillar 9. GE Aerospace 10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia 11. Walmart/Target 12. Starbucks / McDonalds 13. UPS 14. JP Morgan / Bank of America 15. Berkshire / Markel 16. Disney 17. Tesla / GM 18. Hershey 19. Dollar General 20. Lockheed Martin  Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate.   Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.  Edit: Some really good points in the comments.   1. Most of my regular investing goes to VOO. Think of this as a fun little experiment  2. Since all of these are mature large companies, maybe it makes more sense to go with mid cap stocks. In that case, what would you pick?,;,; 2024-01-18 21:13:00]
[If some big tech companies have independent auditors then there should be far fewer big surprises in earnings reports.,;,; Trying to understand why there are some jaw dropping surprises in big tech earnings reports for companies that choose to have independent ;auditors. It's not a requirement to have them but Nvidia may have independent auditors who release their opinions before an earnings report goes public.   If that's true then the consensus auditors and other consensus experts should not be so surprised at an earnings report considering the financials are shared before earnings come out and not after  Did a little research to see if that's how Nvidia operates and I'm no expert on it. So if anyone knows more about it and if I'm making the right assumptions.,;,; 2023-08-24 19:18:12]

[Why would you not invest in Berkshire Hathaway ?,;,; Since 1965, Berkshire Hathaway has delivered an average annual return of almost 20% to its shareholders, compared to 10% for the S&amp;P 500.   When you see that, you want to invest in this company even if past performance is not indicative of futur results.   Why would you not invest in this company ?    When you see the numbers...      * Berkshire Hathaway is the 7th largest market capitalization, behind Nvidia, with a valuation of $790 billion. (In comparison, BlackRock, well-known to the general public, has a market capitalization of $105 billion.) * Berkshire Hathaway achieved $302 billion in revenue in 2022, a 9.37% increase from 2021. * BH has over $73 billion in cash reserves. * It holds stakes in companies like Coca Cola, Bank of America, and notably Apple, of which they own over 5%. It is basically an ETF (without dividends)     Warren Buffett is one of the world's best fund managers. He has some basic principles that we should all use:  * Invest only in businesses you understand, with favorable long-term prospects, led by competent management, and at reasonable prices. * Look for a long-term competitive advantage in a stable industry. * Seek exceptional companies at reasonable prices, not mediocre companies at bargain prices.        The Risks I see:     * The company's past performance has been incredible, but its current size will inevitably slow down its performance.  * Warren Buffet is 93 years old. What is going to happen to BH when he die ? Even that seems ok: It's known that Howard Buffet will be the future Chairman and Greg Abel the future CEO when Warren is no longer around. Greg Abel shares the same basic principles of management and investment as Warren Buffett. * Lastly, Warren Buffet is not exposed to Green and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) topics. Some consider him outdated in this regard.,;,; 2023-09-06 07:39:39]
[S&amp;p 500 Tech vs NASDAQ 100 vs Stocks for AI,;,; Greetings!     I wanna invest into AI and cant decide whats the best call there. I think most will agree that the best bet for AI is to invest into the Big Companys: Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Meta, Google and Amazon. (Tesla not included because i dont like Elon tbh).     Investing into S&amp;P Tech will give me big Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA but not the other companys. Investing into NASDAQ 100 will give me all of them, but with a lower Rate (can be good can be bad). And of course i just can buy those 6 Stocks.     I think Apple (even if they dont have LLMs yet) will be big in AI in 1-2 Years and the capability shipping local AI on all of their devices are insane.  Huge potential here + we talk about Apple. Microsoft is playing the AI game better than anyone else right now and coming GPT Versions will slap. I also like the new approach of Meta and with LLAMA there is also huge Potential. NVIDIA is of course also a no brainer (even if some ppl think they are overvalued), they are way ahead of other companys like AMD right now. Amazon while not having insane LLMs right now, has of course on of the best Sectors to apply AI in general.     With alphabet i have to say, im not so sure. Their new Model is strong, but i kinda didn't feel good about the company as a whole. Hard to explain why.      What would you do and why if AI is the goal ? Just buy the Stocks or ETFs ?     &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-07-25 10:23:54]

[I‚Äôm confused. What‚Äôs the point of buying a stock?,;,; I‚Äôm genuinely confused so I would appreciate it if anyone could address my points.  Point 1: So, first of all, there are two ways a person can make money off a stock: Either through dividends, or having the stock appreciate in value, and then selling it. Am I right to say that?  Let‚Äôs look at stocks without dividends.   Point 2: A stock‚Äôs price is ultimately moved only by supply and demand. It doesn‚Äôt matter how successful a company is. At the end of the day, a stock‚Äôs price will only go up if there is demand for the stock. Am I right to say that?  Point 3: People buy stocks in hopes of the stock price increasing, but a stock‚Äôs price only increases when people buy the stock.   With point 3 in mind, it leads to my final question, what drives the demand for stock in the first place? Why would anyone want to hold a share of a company if the only way they make a profit is if someone buys the stock back from them at a higher price.,;,; 2024-01-31 00:44:30]
[Huge difference in stock prices between similar companies?,;,; Hey all,      I'm curious as to why some companies within the same sector (eg nvidia and intel) with similar market shares are priced so differently. For example, intel's share price is around $25 and it is the largest semiconductor producer worldwide. However, nvidia is rated as the 6th largest and has a share price of $236. Similarly, despite that Pfizer was as influential in producing covid vaccines as moderna, its price barely climbed while Moderna's soared. What is the explanation for these differences, and why some companies grow in share price and investor hype while others fail to? Btw this is part of my personal research for an equity research comp, TIA!,;,; 2023-02-25 02:02:18]
[Taking out all of my retirement and going all in on a stock or few instead,;,; I know this has risk but I don't even think about the retirement money - it is from a former company and my current one doesn't haven a retirement plan - and it isn't much relative to others here I would expect. It is perhaps 20K.  I am considering just going all in on Telsa and/or Apple, or NVIDIA stock, and just letting it fly.  This is a high risk high reward. Anyone take this route?

[Popularity Isn't a Moat: What The Collapse of Dating Apps Tells Us About Companies,;,; **Swipe Left on Profits:** Big dating apps like Bumble and Match Group are watching their stock prices go south faster than a bad Tinder date, with Bumble's shares dropping 32% this year and Match Group's not far behind, down 28%. Seems like Zoomers are breaking up with online dating, preferring the old-school charm of meeting in person.      *YTD Share Performance of Major Dating Apps:*   \- Grindr: +25%   \- Match Group: -28%   \- Bumble: -32%   \- Spark Networks: -98%     **Take-Aways:** I‚Äôm no expert on the dating apps (I‚Äôve been with my wife since I was a pimple-faced school boy) but think there is a broader theme that investors need to be cautious of; that things trendy with the twentysomethings can evaporate quite quickly.      *Performance Since IPO of Select 'Trendy Stocks':*   \- Snapchat: -58%   \- Robinhood: -77%   \- GoPro: -91%   \- Allbirds: -97%   \- Blue Apron: -99%      Companies like GoPro and Snapchat were all extremely popular at one time but things change - and often quickly. A key term for investors is that of a ‚Äòmoat‚Äô: characteristics ingrained in your business model that makes it hard for competitors or copy-cats to come along and steal your market share. While things like a company‚Äôs ‚Äòbrand‚Äô can be an example of a moat, ‚Äòpopularity‚Äô isn‚Äôt the same thing. Brands are built over years from their connection to things like quality (Volvo), trustworthiness (Wall Street Journal) or coolness (Hermes).      *Examples of Economic Moats:*     * **Low-Cost Producers:** Provide a low cost that is usually based on significant economies of scale. Examples include Walmart, Southwest, FedEx. * **High Switching Costs:** Material expense (money, time, effort) required in order to move to competitor. Examples include Salesforce, Oracle, Microsoft. * **Network Effect:** Value to customer increases with the number of people on the platform. Examples include Ebay, Uber, Reddit. * **Intangible Assets:** Brand names, intellectual property, trade secrets, government approvals. Examples include Pfizer, Nvidia, Coca-Cola.      Moreover, often these companies that achieve near overnight success do so because their business doesn‚Äôt require significant time, expense or technological sophistication in order to reach such a scale. Looking at the companies I've mentioned, in nearly every case some smart folks with a laptop can replicate their business model; improve on it; and steal their customers. In essence, the things that can be built quickly, are often built on sand.    ,;,; 2023-11-13 17:46:24]

[Seeking Advice on NVDA Investment Dilemma - Diversify, hedge or ride the wave?,;,;    I'm in a bit of a conundrum with my NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) investment and could really use some advice.  Currently, I own 50 shares of NVDA valued at around $30,000, purchased back in 2017 at $34 per share, with a cost basis of $1,700. This stock has seen unbelievable growth since then of over 1600% and now constitutes 45% of my non-taxable investment account and roughly 20% of all my investment accounts, excluding my home.  Last year, I sold about $5000 worth of NVDA to diversify, but I'm torn about what to do next. On one hand, the stock has been on a tear, and their future looks extremely promising with AI advancements and the huge demand for chips going forward. However, I'm aware of the need to diversify, as well as the risk of the stock taking a massive downturn and significantly hurting my net worth. There are also tax considerations if I sell, since I'll be on the hook for some significant capital gains tax.   For some context, I'm a married man with two kids, a house with $200k in equity and a $200k mortgage. I have around $80k in IRA accounts and $65k in taxable brokerage accounts amd some cash on hand for emergency fund etc. Little debt otherwise.   Any advice on whether to sell and diversify, ways to mitigate risks, or hedging strategies would be greatly appreciated. How should I navigate this situation, considering the potential tax bill, its outsized share of my portfolio and the promising future for NVDA?

[Buy high or find something else?,;,; Hello everyone.  I promise this is not a "I have $X to invest" post.  I'm curious about the investment strategy of buying high when it's a good company.  For examples, look at Microsoft, Amazon, Eli Lilly, and Nvidia.  All at very high points.  Hitting new all time highs even.  In theory, my heart says if you truly believe in the company and that the stock will go up, then buying high isn't a problem.  But my brain is just like, NO, it'll clearly go down.  You never buy high lol.  So what do YOU all do?  Do you have a favorite stock that you buy more of no matter how high it gets? Or do you just enjoy the ride with what you have and look for something else to invest in?  I do have some small positions in those four companies, which is why I'm familiar with them. Clearly I'm comfortable enough with them to hold the shares I have. But my brain is just so wired to not buy high at peaks.  I've read a decent amount of different strategies and things to look for, but I've never really seen anything about a successful company and buying high.  I know it could be a little subjective too. Depends on your age and risk tolerance and things like that and what you are looking for, but I guess I'm just trying to go for a more General approach in this question. But in an effort to help if people want, I'm mid 30s, married, kids on the way. Have a good job and not worry about retirement. My personal investing is to try to Simply make money for me and the family for stuff like trips and fixing the house and things like that, so risk tolerance is fairly high.  TL:DR I guess you could boil this down to a simple question.  "When is it too late to jump on the train?"  Thank you.,;,; 2024-02-16 15:46:24]

Here's my idea.  30% VTI - Keeps a good baseline  20% AVUV - Small cap value has historically outperformed thanks to being exposed to more risk factors.  20% QQQM - This is where I'm looking for a boost to my returns this year. I know that the QQQ is flawed so maybe it would be better to go with VUG?  10% VXUS - Keeping at least some international diversification in case it catches up this year.  20% individual stocks - My favorites are Berkshire Hathaway, Nvidia, ASML, and TSMC.

[Should I remove my current tech stocks from my portfolio?,;,; I started investing a considerable amount of money by the end of 2021.

I sold Nvidia a couple months ago thinking it would reverse after its huge rise and it actually continued to grow until now.   What are your thoughts about this? Should I just hold it all?

[What market trends are you BULLISH on for 2024?,;,; Hey all! Just trying to familiarize myself with some of the most talked about investment opportunities in the market right now as well as potential stock picks for each. Feel free to correct any info here or add on more. Just looking to start a discussion on the different hot topics lately and the following stock picks that go along with them! I know there are several other big opportunities like weed,crypto,etc just didn‚Äôt wanna go overboard  **Lithium ( MALRY, LAC)**The booming EV market, along awith the growing demand for renewable energy storage, positions lithium as a key investment opportunity. Major automaker's substantial investments in EVs drive the need for lithium-ion batteries, while the increasing focus on sustainable energy ensures a sustained demand for lithium. Despite global lithium deposits, the challenge of securing a stable and cost-effective supply persists, presenting investment potential in companies involved in lithium exploration, mining, and battery production.  **GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, INTL )**Demand for GPUs comes from AI and machine learning for handling big data in areas like healthcare and finance. Data centers need GPUs for cloud computing as businesses shift operations online. In the gaming industry, GPUs are crucial for high-quality graphics in video games. Cryptocurrency mining, particularly for coins like Ethereum, relies on GPUs for their processing power. Overall, the demand is driven by the growing need for high-performance GPUs in AI, data centers, gaming, and cryptocurrency mining.  **Uranium (BHP, NXE )**The demand for uranium primarily stems from its crucial role in fueling nuclear power generation. As global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources intensify, the demand for nuclear energy has been on the rise, particularly in emerging economies like China and India. This growing demand, coupled with supply constraints and geopolitical factors affecting uranium production, creates a decent investment opportunity. As countries strive to meet their energy needs while minimizing carbon emissions, uranium stands out as a key component in the clean energy landscape.  &amp;#x200B;  Are you betting on any of these?

[I am Swing-Trading stock since two years with small amounts of money and it works so far, should I start doing it on a bigger scale?,;,; 2 years ago I created a new account solely for the purpose of me learning to invest into single stocks rather than (what I had done until this point) investing into ETFs and leave it at that. I didn't even start to "make money fast" like other people do, but really just to educate myself on some companies and learn something about idiosyncratic risk etc. I started with 900 Euro (about 1000 $) and managed to almost triple that amount in the span of two years. If you guys are interested in the specifics of the trades feel free to ask, but for now to keep it short, I basically did swing trades on a handful of companies on which I did extensive due diligence in advance: namely Airbnb, Shopify, Tesla, and Nvidia.   Now I am wondering: Should I switch the investment strategy on my "regular" account from passive ETF investments to swing-trading individual stocks as well? I would be considered a risk-averse person, so this type of strategy goes against my natural, but 3x-ing my money in two years seems to beat the market by miles. Or was I just "lucky" to pick stocks which were going up anyways?   &amp;#x200B;  Would love to hear some other perspective on that issue.

[Investing discussion on a US-China war: which US companies will be the winners and losers, and which will just pull through?,;,; Apologies for how political this is. I couldn't see in the rules any issue relating to posting political-related discussion, but this is a very relevant and important question I'd like to discuss among investors, seeing the growing tensions between the US and China. The majority of my stocks are in US companies, despite not living in the US, so I will be effected regardless.   Looking at history, war time isn't necessarily economic woe for all companies. During WWII the Ford company supplied the US military with vehicles and war supplies. Other companies were similarly pulled in, and many actually greatly benefitted from their involvement in some way or another.   The question is, what do you all think could be some notable winners, losers, or companies who are able to pull through (whether they win or not)?

[Should I keep or sell rivian/lucid stock,;,; took a chance on rivian and lucid a few years ago and the stocks basically have done nothing but lost money.not really upset about it that‚Äôs life. Rivian is down like 84% and lucid is down like 94%.I was hoping after a year or so their stock prices would go up but it‚Äôs continually down very high numbers..  But if I hold onto them and the companies turn around in 5-10 years whatever  I‚Äôd be ina position to make a decent bit.so basically I‚Äôm asking for thoughts and opinions on if you guys think either or both companies might rally and start going upwards despite how terribly they‚Äôve both done this far.  At this point if I sold both i wouldn‚Äôt really be getting shit back so I‚Äôm inclined to just hold them seeing as how I don‚Äôt plan on needing any of my market investment money for like 30 years.any thoughts are appreciated,;,; 2024-01-15 20:05:06]

[Just how big are the Magnificent Seven?,;,; This is a big quote from MarketWatch. I‚Äôve seen the numbers before, but this really gave me pause.   &gt; These captains of the SS S&amp;P 500 are Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. They've been described as the magnificent seven by many news organizations. Fortunately for me, there's a common thread among this group. They are the only U.S. companies that have ever been valued at a trillion dollars by the public markets. To say these companies are dominating the S&amp;P 500 is a giant understatement. Last year, their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S&amp;P 500's valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65% of the Index's market cap gain last year, despite comprising just 1.4% of its components. But doesn't this go against the main reason behind investing in S&amp;P 500 index funds? Wouldn't the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed?  &gt; Phil Van Dorn: Well, I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry, traditionally, you might be looking at expenses of 1% of assets under management per year, and that can really pile up over time. But with an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund, your expenses get close to zero. But as you have mentioned when you called the group of expensive stocks the Trillionaires' Club, a small group of companies now make up between 27 and 30% of the S&amp;P 500 depending on which day you look at it.  &gt; Jeremy Owens: Right, so that's seven out of 500 companies accounting for more than a quarter or less than a third of the entire market cap of the S&amp;P 500 and really swaying the underlying metrics. What should an investor kind of take from this and how should we look at the S&amp;P 500 moving forward, knowing how much these companies matter?  &gt; Phil Van Dorn: One can say that there's a heck of a lot of risk in the seven companies that make up only 1% of the S&amp;P 500, but make up close to a third of its value. However, the S&amp;P 500 is self-correcting. It rewards success.,;,; 2024-01-20 00:51:08]
[Has anyone heard that a portfolio balanced equally by sector will beat the S&amp;P 500 over time?,;,; I was just speaking with a (potential) financial advisor today. He discussed, for example how the S&amp;P 500 is way overweighted in tech, particularly because 7 of the top 10 holdings are all megatech giants: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, Google/Alphabet (twice), and Tesla. These 7 alone make up 21% of the value of the S&amp;P 500.  Obviously, this leads to underweighting in other sectors. And this leads to underperformance and increased volatility over long periods of time. As evidence of this, he brought up a chart that showed that if you equally weight your investments across the various sectors (financials, materials, utilities, healthcare, etc.), that it would outperform the S&amp;P 500, provided that you rebalance periodically.  Has anyone heard of an investment portfolio like this? I did a little research, and it looks like for periods of 15 years or greater, this is right - an portfolio that's equally weighted by sector, and rebalanced periodically, will outperform the S&amp;P by 1.5% to 2% annually.  I'd love to hear your thoughts about this. Anyone have a portfolio like this? Is there some kind of equal weighting ETF or mutual fund that does this automatically? Thanks.,;,; 2023-02-28 09:15:41]
[Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market?,;,; Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market? I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity.  Then, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want.     It goes on and on. Looking at Palantir which trades at a crazy multiple, or basically any software company, yes it's possible to buy Palantir or any stock and it triple, but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words, Real INVESTING seems to be literally impossible right now.     Even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline.      And there are questions like how is this possible and is this partly due to extremely irresponsible Fed reserve activity mainly due to QE pushing valuations to their highest levels ever. Also do the people here think that this is the worst investing environment ever when compared to historical pe ratios?,;,; 2024-02-13 14:28:31]
[Wheel Strategy Idea: Super itm,;,; So, I've been doing some thinking/analysis about the wheel strategy. Some appeals to it are the guaranteed premiums it brings in, the relatively small risk it has, and the ability to be flexible in most markets (assuming you're wheeling a good stock).   Usually, you try to sell your initial put otm for a chance at more later and to not get assigned at an "upcharge." Some people are able to make this their full time job. Here's what I've been thinking: What if you were to sell the put way itm? With enough collateral (I played around with the numbers) you could take a year's salary in the form of one premium on a single, week-long put. You would obviously be assigned, but you'd have an entire year to make up the difference by selling cc's, the stock going up, and dividends. Selling super safe calls (staying way itm) every week should in theory be enough to cover the "salary" as well as churn a profit for most of the stocks I analyzed (Nvidia, Apple, even VOO). And to me, it seems even safer than buying and holding, due to the "salary" being instant.   Is this the GOAT of trading? Or does this belong in r/wallstreetbets?,;,; 2023-09-17 13:04:48]
[How many individual stocks in your eyes is too much?,;,; Out of curiosity how many individual stocks in your eyes is too much?   My train of thought behind my pickings is that I allocate the majority of my money to a world index so I‚Äôm not overweighting a particular sector or region but then allocate a small portion of my funds to individual stocks that I personally use day to day and have high confidence in.  For reference, 66% of my money is tied up in a world index (VWRL). 12% is tied up in small cap index funds. 50% in USA and 50% in Europe. (ZPRV and ZPRX)  11% is tied up in individual stocks. The list of stocks are:  Amazon - I use this quite frequently since I‚Äôm a member.  Apple - I use their tech.  Microsoft - familiar with their business model and use their software such as word and PowerPoint.  Meta - I use instagram and WhatsApp, I don‚Äôt use Facebook but its power in advertising is immense.  Johnson &amp; Johnson - leader in health such as vaccines.  Visa &amp; Mastercard - I personally use Mastercard but both are identical and leaders.  Alphabet - I use their software.  AMD - gaming as they‚Äôre used in Xbox and PlayStation plus their future in AI. Taking market share from intel.  Berkshire Hathaway - diversified  McDonald‚Äôs - real estate company that sells food.  JP Morgan - leading bank that is diversified.  Caterpillar - leading manufacture in mining/ agriculture/ construction machinery. Plus I‚Äôve got a placement sorted with them so there‚Äôs a bit of bias lol.  Nvidia - leader in AI and GPU production.  Walmart - powerhouse in America.  Costco - their membership model is cash flow powerhouse plus they‚Äôre present in numerous countries.  Waste management - trash will always be here.  ASML - absolute gem of a company and many years ahead of any competitors. Every tech company is reliant on them.  Airbus - I love planes and their business is far more desirable than Boeing.  Lockheed Martin - peace was never an option.  Once again, I‚Äôve chose to invest into these companies individually as I want to overweigh them as I‚Äôm more confident in them than others. I‚Äôm willing to put my money where my mouth is. I‚Äôm aware they‚Äôre contained in the world index. I don‚Äôt do any technical analysis, it‚Äôs all confidence and familiarity.  I also invest in REITs, I invest into leading REITs in each sector such as industrial, data etc. 11% of my portfolio is in REITs. 10 in total. I use alreits to track them, and track them quarterly.  I don‚Äôt plan on selling until retirement. Currently 19.  Thanks.,;,; 2024-02-17 17:00:00]
[Seeking Feedback on my ETF Portfolio in Roth IRA: Diversification Concerns,;,; Hey fellow Redditors,  I've been diligently building my ETF portfolio in my Roth IRA, but lately, I've been questioning whether I have too many ETFs and if there's potential overlap or duplication issues.

[Thinking of swapping a mutual fund for its ETF equivalent (in IRA), lower fees, better long term return,;,; I have a good size portion of my retirement money in FSELX (fees .67%).  I'm thinking of selling it all and buying SOXX (fees .35%).  Is this a no-brainer?  I wouldn't be subject to taxes because it's in a retirement account, right?  Hurts to look at the long term performance of these two funds because on top of the fees (or maybe because of it), SOXX has done so much better than FSELX.  And faith in semiconductors and how long until retirement aside (I'm early 50's but that shouldn't matter), if I was willing to be in FSELX, I should be just as willing to be in SOXX, correct?  Edit: Looking into these more, I guess you can't really say they are the "exact same" in the same way you can say VOO is the same as SPY.  They both hold Nvidia, of course.  But in FSELX, its 24% of holdings while in SOXX in 10%.  Whether that's good or not remains to be seen.  So I guess this does require putting some brains to it.,;,; 2023-02-23 19:49:33]

Inmode has the **highest** gross margins in the industry (83-84%).  **Insider ownership**  Insiders sold a big stake in their holdings in 2021 when the price of the stock in the market was high. They own about 8% at the moment (down from 35% in the past)  **MOAT**  After a thorough analysis, I concluded that Inmode has a **narrow MOAT** meaning they have a competitive advantage in **manufacturing** (by outsourcing it which makes their business capital-light compared to competitors). Their only other competitive advantage is **distribution**. They sell to 92 countries at the moment. Each country has its own regulations (FDA) and hoops to jump through before being able to sell.  **Capital allocation strategy**  Inmode boasts a **very high historical return on invested capital** (200%) and incremental invested capital. They have earned well above their cost of capital. They are piling up cash and have an employee incentive program that is dilutive. In 2022, for the first time, they **bought back shares** to offset this dilution.

[Industries with Blue Chip Growth stocks that aren't tech ?,;,; My personal portfolio is heavily weighted on Tech. I have been risk averse, so most of it is in Blue Chip Tech companies who are well positioned to take advantage of the upcoming technological revolutions but also have solid revenue making product moats. (MSFT, AAPL). I also have a HUGE unvested position in the AI revolution. So no more money in AI for me.  As I look towards diversifying my portfolio, I am struggling to find any industry that also meets the following demands:  * Solid products that will make money today and 50 years from now * Sane P/E ratios (Keep it under 50 at least) * Poised to take advantage of one of the upcoming technological revolutions (ie. can expand their market) * Hard to beat Moat  The other industries that seem to have strong potential are the kind that have been losing money through the likes of Cathy Woods different ARK ETFs. All of Genomics, Drug Development, Space, 3D printing etc. are bleeding money by double digit percentages every year. Manufacturing companies are slowly revolutionizing, but I don't see their market expanding in a fashion that lets their stocks explode. Many others like mining &amp; energy seem to be so heavily regulated, that your investment is more a reflection of trust in the political class than the actual industry.   The compute hardware industry makes sense to me, but I am already invested in non-Nvidia players and it is too close to Tech anyway. Novo Nordisk satisfied all those requirements, and I was planning on investing in it in January. Dragged my feet with it, and the train has passed.  I can take risks. I am already maxing out my 401ks with safe index funds and I am 30 with my responsibilities paid off. But, don't say Crypto or weed-stocks. I have already been burned on both. I still maintain some crypto, but I am not changing my position on that. Either it all sinks or goes somewhere. Not an extra dollar in or out. Also, no Elon Musk companies please. Meme stocks aren't investments, it's gambling.  To me, genomics, drones (military) and surveillance are going to explode 10x at least in the next 10 years. I know founders in each of them, and have a strong intuition for the base technology. Not approaching it from a 'shiny new thing' perspective. But they are all so regulated and intertwined with Govts, that it is impossible to know who to put money on.,;,; 2023-09-29 15:07:21]

[Need help unloading Apple,;,; Hi all,   Sorry in advance on formatting, I‚Äôm writing this on my phone.   My wife (28F) and I (35M) are going to be diversifying from apple and would love your opinions. I will give a brief background about us and also our financial situation.   My wife is finishing her masters program in the spring of 24 and will be making about 100k a year. She will have about 70k in student debt. I am in tech and earn about 175-250k with zero debt. We have 1 daughter who is 3 years old. We live in a HCOL area in Northern California and fortunately have a paid off residence.   The allocations below are held in a trust which took a 90k loss last year and gives us the opportunity to reduce allocation % in apple. Essentially we will be selling 90,000 in capital gains (roughly 690+ shares) and diversifying.   (Trust) Apple shares - 3,250 ($572,975) Shwab CD - $125,000 (4.1% &amp; expiring in October 2023)  Cash - 14.5k  Personal brokerage  Apple shares - 620 ($109,306) Nvidia shares - 15 ($6,720 Tesla - 10 ($2,670) 529 account - ($4,000) VTI - $22,420 (Roth ira) 401k - $101,000 (VTSAX) Cash - 35k  Our Schwab advisor is pushing for a self directed index through Schwab. The Schwab advisor  wants us to harvest losses in the future so we can diversify apple to even out the allocations. Minimum investment amount is 100k into this self directed index fund. Our longLong term goal is wanting to have a 10-15% allocation in apple.   My question to the group is, what should my next step be? I‚Äôm a little skeptical about a self directed index fund because it‚Äôs a Schwab robo advisor with .4% fees. Should i just sell 75% of the entire trust and VTI or VOO it? We are very fortunate to be in this situation but are losing sleep at night with everything in 1 stock.   Thank you in advance!,;,; 2023-09-18 20:52:56]
[Do Quants Rule the Markets?,;,; While most were bracing for a correction due to bank failures and commercial real estate issues, quant funds went against the grain, buying up stocks rather than selling or shorting. As a result, instead of economic unrest, we saw consistent market indices.  Deutsche Bank [reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-are-markets-so-calm-its-revenge-of-the-quant-funds-26a93425?mod=rss_markets_main) that quant funds' net share of US assets reached their highest levels since December 2021. Coupled with active corporate stock buybacks, the S&amp;P 500 has swayed less than 1% in either direction for 36 out of the last 46 sessions.  So, what's the mechanism here?  As volatility subsides, quants press 'Buy.' This happened when regulators intervened to prevent a banking crisis, and the Fed indicated an end to rate hikes.  Here you might be asking yourself, ‚Äúbut when the **VIX** surges, shouldn‚Äôt funds counterintuitively reduce their positions?‚Äù  Theoretically, yes. Practically, however, no.  Take the May 2019 market crash, when the S&amp;P 500 dropped by around 7% amid panic over the US-China trade war. McElligott estimates quants jettisoned $35 billion worth of stocks within a month.  Of course, you probably noticed that the VIX crossed 20 twice in May. So‚Ä¶why no crash?  First, we don't fully understand quant fund algorithms.  Second, retail investor backing has grown.  Additionally, last week's favorable Nvidia report played its role. The total market cap of AI-related firms swelled by nearly $100 billion in a day.  If all of this is true, then when will the long-awaited correction occur?  Corrections often come when market confidence is high and a 'bullish trend' appears all but irreversible. Once investors start buying every dip, convinced that a surge is imminent...that's usually when the rug gets pulled out from under them‚Äînot when everyone is on high alert, shorting left and right, but when they aren‚Äôt.,;,; 2023-05-31 10:22:07]
[How can I use correlation coefficients to build a portfolio,;,; Hi all,  Before starting, I'll just point out that most of my portfolio is index funds and ETFs. But I do have maybe 10-15% in single stocks, just to satisfy the inner (wannabe) Buffett.  So we've all heard the advice that diversification is important when building a portfolio. Correct me if wrong, but this can mean across different stocks, or by diversifying across assets, like stocks and real estate.   I was looking for some online calculator that could find the correlation between two stocks and found this:  https://www.buyupside.com/calculators/stockcorrelationinput.php  It lets you put two stocks and the time period to calculate the correlation between.   Could something like this be used just as a rudimentary tool. Either to see how whether you're actually as diversified as you think or to see you're not over concentrating in one area. Like investing in 5 different popular tech giants, which seems to be a thing some people do.   However, some results I found were a bit strange so not sure if that means using figures like these are not so useful? Eg, apple and Goldman Sachs had a correction of 0.8585 over the past 5 years and 0.9058 over the last 10 years. Or Nvidia and PepsiCo also having a correlation just over 0.85.   Are these figures just because stocks have generally all gone up over these time periods so the end result would be that mathematically they are correlated? Even though they are completely different industries/business models?  So can mathemical concepts/figures like these be useful, or do they not mean much since they are backwards looking, and it's better to diversify by knowledge of the different businesses. Such as, we might say intuitively that Apple and PepsiCo should be uncorrelated, no matter what price history suggests?  A final thought I'd like to hear opinions on, would be choosing from different industries based on the most diversification available.   Eg, you pick Microsoft and apple in the tech sector (not in your portfolio, just as two options available) and PG and PEP in, not sure the exact industry name, but say consumer products? You've done whatever prior research you saw fit to arrive at these businesses and now want to narrow things down for whatever reason.   And then have a 2*2 matrix with the different correlations between pairs. If there is a pair that might have significantly lower correlation than the other three, maybe you could pick that? Or is this still not very useful?,;,; 2024-01-07 21:43:24]
[What are your thoughts on Qualcomm?,;,; All,  Have been following and holding Qualcomm for about 2 years now. I know that smartphones is a cyclical industry and is currently in a slump. Qualcomm still has high inventory issues and have guided another quarter of falling revenues and earnings.  Having said that, **Qualcomm's intrinsic value based on DCF is around $156** https://valueinvesting.io/QCOM/valuation/dcf-growth-exit-5y  It is diversifying beyond smartphones and is aggressively pursuing automotive and IoT markets.  It also released a new chip that brings AI to smartphones. While the applications are limited to battery monitoring and camera improvements (hardware based) right now, they can easily move to other areas of enhancements.   Regarding loss of revenues from Apple, it will still take Apple 3-4 years to phase out existing devices that use Qualcomm chips. The 5 billion revenue Qualcomm gets from Apple will be covered by IoT + automotive by then.  Lastly, people can only delay buying a smartphone, not avoid it completely, especially buying high end phones. Which means once the slump is over, Qualcomm will make a very strong comeback.  Any thoughts? I want to buy more but would love to hear some critical arguments in the mean time.  Edit: Qualcomm's also making PC chips. Remains to be seen if they can eat Intel's lunch like AMD.  https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/qualcomm-claims-laptops-destroy-intel-chips-in-ai/,;,; 2023-05-30 17:33:52]
[1 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,;,; Last year there was a post asking what folks were doing to profit from the current/upcoming recession on Hacker News: [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33040211](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33040211)  I replied ([https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33041751](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33041751)) that I purchased some pandemic stocks, which I started doing in April 2022. Most of my purchasing was through summer 2022, but I've bought others more recently, like Carvana on the dip in December (which luckily popped since it became a meme stock), as well as Meta, Amazon and Google on the dips in October. The most recent was Allbirds on the dip in March since I had just purchased the shoes and they quickly became my favorite.  Overall, I'm up 36%, but as you can imagine a few winners (which I luckily have larger stakes in) make up for the losers. My target timeline is \~3 years, and we could still see a deeper recession from a hard landing, so I plan to post more annual updates.  There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I've summarized each with the overall unrealized gain/loss so far as of this morning:  * Affirm: -11.33% * Amazon: +25.25% * Allbirds: +9.43% * Coinbase: -34.32% * Carvana: +306.5% * Google: +29.35% * Meta: +170.89% * Cloudflare: +14.35% * Netflix: +97.08% * Peloton: -54.61% * Roblox: +25.14% * Shopify: +39.26% * Snapchat: +3.21% * Snowflake: +11.14% * Unity: +8.91%  **Some commentary**  It's hard to convey how much of a roller coaster the the last 12 months have been, with some pretty large negative swings that I just had to watch and not react to. There are likely more to come, especially since it seems a lot of the potential good news is already priced in.  Interestingly, in that post I mentioned Peloton was one I regretted almost instantly, and is now my worst performer by far. Unfortunately, greed got the best of me and I caught that falling knife buying a few times as the stock dropped further. I was hoping they would get rid of the excess inventory, improve distribution and double down on subscriptions to turn things around, but that hasn't materialized. Maybe it still will, or they get acquired.  Despite the strong gains, I still feel Shopify (improved focus, strong brand), Netflix (new ad tier, other new streaming services struggling and likely to go back to content), and Meta (improved targeting post privacy changes + AI opportunities) still have good upside potential.  I also really like Microsoft due to their enterprise moat and opportunities with AI, but their stock never had the correction the other stocks did and that was the scent I was chasing at the time (right or wrong). But long-term, I also wonder if AI will negate the need for human productivity software since the AI can just do it and review/edit mode requires less bloat (e.g. video with Final Cut Pro vs. TikTok, or images with Photoshop vs. Instagram). I wouldn't doubt if we see an AI-native productivity suite that doesn't just integrate AI, but predicated on simplfy reviewing AI generated content.  I'm disappointed to have missed Nvidia (up 3X since October) since I used to own it and have been watching it since the crypto bust created excess inventory and a predictable dip, then the AI trend led to the recovery. The valuation feels rich, but could easily grow into it given the trajectory of AI, unless the hyperscalers make their own chips.  Perhaps counterintuitively, it seems it's more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts than financial analysts/stock pickers since, at the end of the day, you need to make your own decisions about the fundamentals and prospects of the business. Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but by definition backward looking while valuation is forward looking.  I'm curious to see how these perform if the US enters a broader recession in the next 18 months. I don't plan to sell unless something catastrophic happens and I see a better opportunity to shift to.  **Update \~6mo later here:** https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/,;,; 2023-06-12 19:18:14]
[The most crucial topic this week will involve corporate reports. Who are the leaders, and who are the laggards?,;,; Below, I'm offering up the sectors  that I believe have the greatest potential for improved financial  performance, as well as those that may disappoint investors.  I expect an increase in financial performance in the following areas:  1Ô∏è‚É£ Technology: Primarily, companies specializing in AI and hardware production.  ‚ñ™ **Nvidia (NVDA)** graphics cards remain highly popular among users, while **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)** and **Intel (INTC)** may also signal a recovery in demand. AI product creators **Alphabet (GOOG)** and **Microsoft (MSFT)** could also see increased demand for their products in the coming quarters, boosting profits.  2Ô∏è‚É£  Cryptocurrency companies: Rising prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and  other coins are likely to boost profits from commissions for the **Coinbase** crypto exchange **(COIN)** and from the mining company **Marathon Digital (MARA)**.  3Ô∏è‚É£ Energy and precious metals mining:  ‚ñ™ Mineral prices (gold and silver) exhibited a growth trend in the reporting quarter. This could send profits for **Newmont (NEM)** and **Barrick Gold (GOLD)** soaring.  ‚ñ™ Increasing energy demand could result in higher revenues for **Peabody Energy (BTU)** and **Arch Resources (ARCH)**.  Laggards:  1Ô∏è‚É£ Financial: Tightening credit conditions and deposit outflows are likely to primarily impact regional banks such as **First Republic Bank (FRC)**. Large banks, including those with investment banking divisions like **Bank of America (BAC)** and **JP Morgan (JPM)**,  could benefit from deposit inflows and increased asset values in the  stock market. However, the quality of their loan portfolios is  deteriorating, and reserves are growing.  I'm not ready to add these shares to my portfolios, so I will continue to observe the dynamics of these stocks.  Additionally, the reports from **Wells Fargo (WFC)**, JP Morgan Chase, and **Citigroup (C)** showed decent results thanks to cost control and growth in net interest income.  2Ô∏è‚É£  Consumer: Stores, including online marketplaces, typically experience a  decline in demand in the 1st quarter following holiday sales. I  anticipate a drop in demand indicators from **Best Buy (BBY)**, **Walmart (WMT)**, **GAP (GPS)**, as well as **Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)**, which faces bankruptcy.  3Ô∏è‚É£  Healthcare: The coronavirus pandemic and seasonal colds have subsided,  and the increased demand for drugs has dwindled. Medical companies such  as **Teva (TEVA)**, **Pfizer (PFE)**, and **Novavax (NVAX)** could increase spending on new drugs, which would impact shareholder returns negatively.  Conclusion:  Adding  a sector to one list or another doesn't necessarily mean that after the  report is presented, all of the stocks in promising sectors will soar  while all of those in the laggard category will tank. Rather, these are  thoughts on on the medium- and long-term growth prospects of specific  sectors in my field of vision.,;,; 2023-04-17 14:40:00]
[2024 According to 5 Major Financial Institutions,;,; LINKS to outlooks:   * [BlackRock](https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-global-outlook-2024.pdf) * [JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/outlook/market-outlook) * [Citi](https://www.privatebank.citibank.com/doc/investments/outlook/Citi_Wealth-Outlook-2024.pdf.coredownload.inline.pdf) * [Mastercard](https://www.mastercardservices.com/en/advisors/economics/insights/economic-outlook-2024) * [Charles Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/2024-global-outlook-big-picture)  I reviewed the 2024 market outlooks of JP Morgan, BlackRock, Citi, Mastercard, and Charles Schwab. This is a summary of their overarching themes.  # Themes  **üí°Inflation and interest rates will fall**  The five firms agree that inflation will continue to fall throughout 2024, giving central banks room to cut interest rates.  Even JP Morgan, the only firm that published a bearish outlook, predicts US inflation will drop to 2.1% with the Fed starting to cut interest rates in the third quarter.  It‚Äôs important to keep in mind that the past three recessions started right after the Fed started cutting interest rates. Expect the market to be more antsy as we near the first rate cut later this year.  **üí°CapEx returns**  Last year, companies (and pretty much everyone else in the economy) were nervous about an impending economic slowdown and companies cut back on spending.  With economic angst subsiding this year, CapEx is expected to bounce back.  More CapEx means higher revenues and faster growth. This is ultimately good for stock prices.  **üí°US election year**  Fed unlikely to do drastic policy changes this year, don't want to stir the pot during election.  Less policy volatility is good for markets.  Largely a nothing burger. If Dems win, business-as-usual. If Reps win, market won't be disappointed since Reps are considered market-friendly. A Rep win is bad for war stocks though.  **üí°First half angst, second half gains**  Citi predicts that economic growth will be slow in the first half of 2024 before accelerating in the second half. They don‚Äôt see a recession happening.  BlackRock also sees the economy slowly recovering this year in a ‚ÄúU-shaped‚Äù fashion.  Tom Lee also thinks it'd be a "slow then grow" year. He predicts that the S&amp;P 500 will be flat or down 5% in the first half of the year before rallying to 5,200 by year-end.  **üí°Everyone is bullish on AI**  The Mag 7 is a good way to get AI exposure, as are chip designers like Nvidia and AMD. Citi is particularly bullish on chip manufacturers given their relative under-performance last year (e.g. TSMC).  In addition, Citi believes that AI has the most potential to uplift these industry segments:  * Mag 7 (mega cap tech) * Infrastructure (chipmakers, semiconductor equipment, data centers) * Robotics * Drug discovery * Cybersecurity  **üí°International: Japan, China, and India**  For international markets, the five firms are generally bullish on Japan, China, and India while being lukewarm on Europe.  The high level bull case for Japan is that the BOJ will finally have to seriously raise interest rates this year. This will lead to a stronger yen, attract more foreign investment into the Japanese economy, and ultimately drive up the dollar value of Japanese tech and finance stocks.  Cool point from Charles Schwab on the power of Japan in global finance:  &gt;Moves by the Bank Of Japan (BOJ) could overshadow those by the Federal Reserve and other central banks if Japanese investors begin to sell foreign bonds, stocks, and currencies. Decades of current account surpluses have accumulated, giving Japan the world's largest net international investment position (even more than China) with $3.3 trillion of investments held abroad according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Although the U.S. has the largest economic influence in the world, Japan may have the largest influence in the asset markets due to these account surpluses. Should the BOJ begin to substantially tighten monetary policy next year, as signaled by the end of yield curve control at the BOJ's meeting in October, the potential for a reversal of decades of outward flow of capital may be felt by investors worldwide. With rates rising in Japan contrasting with rate cuts elsewhere, the yen could surge along with Japanese bond yields, prompting Japanese investors to bring their money home and invest in Japanese assets.  # Risks  **üí°Economic risks**  Interest rates and inflation are top of mind.  The general worry is that we haven‚Äôt felt the full negative effects of 2021-2022‚Äôs large interest rate hikes (perhaps they surface this year?) AND there‚Äôs a high chance we‚Äôre entering into a high interest rate and high inflation economic environment.  **üí°Geopolitical Risks**  Every firm warned about geopolitical risks in 2024, from the ongoing wars in Eastern Europe and the Middle East to tensions in the South China Sea. A couple firms recommended defense and energy stocks as a hedge against these risks.  My contrarian opinion is that 2024 is a year of geopolitical normalization with the major geopolitical hot spots of yesteryear cooling down.  The Red Sea shipping crisis is an annoying thorn on the side of the global supply chain but it seems to be causing limited damage, for now.  Not sure what China will do if Taiwan's 1/13 elections don't play out in their favor. Probably nothing serious as they've always done before.  # Summary  With the exception of JP Morgan, everyone else seems to align on a general theme of ‚Äúeconomic normalization to growth‚Äù for 2024. Citi sees the US economy going through three major phases from the start of the pandemic:  * 2020-2021: emergency low rates and quantitative easing to stimulate the economy * 2022-2023: bear market caution as a result of rapid interest rate hikes and quantitative tightening * 2024-2025: normalization to growth  We agree with this prediction and see more upside for US stocks in 2024. Last year, the S&amp;P 500 almost returned to all-time-highs despite having to climb a wall of worry from a myriad of economic and geopolitical risks. This year, many of those risks are subsiding, opening the way for stocks to go higher.,;,; 2024-01-07 00:41:18]
[What allocation approach is implied by Toby Nangle's new FT article on narrow markets driving equity returns?,;,; What I take from the article below is not to rely too much on a macro-driven asset allocation strategy.  But what asset allocation strategy makes sense in this environment then?    &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;   www.ft.com /content/c5d7ee71-92a2-4840-9344-2f62e9642e61  # Narrow markets should humble macro forecasters  5-6 minutes   2023-08-08   Toby Nangle    The writer is a former global head of asset allocation at a fund manager   This year has been marked by strong equity markets, and what looks to be an astonishingly narrow rally. Of the 16.9 per cent returned by the S&amp;P 500 index in the first half of this year, 12.9 per cent derived from the performance of only 10 companies.   With such a high proportion of a market‚Äôs value created by so few groups, it feels fair to question the tool kits of asset allocators and, more broadly, the product line-up of fund management firms.   Narrow stock market returns are, after all, the norm. Research by Arizona State University professor Hendrik Bessembinder shows that more than half of the $55.1tn in net wealth generated by the US equity market between 1926 and 2022 came from the performance of fewer than 0.3 per cent of the market‚Äôs stocks, with the other half of this net wealth coming from the next best 3.1 per cent of stocks.   Moreover, almost three-fifths of stocks actually destroyed wealth over the period. In quant-speak, the distribution of compound stock returns has been very positively skewed.   In addition, the skewness of equity returns turns out not to be a particularly North American phenomenon. Indeed, in the three decades ending in December 2020 the proportion of net wealth contributed by the best 1 per cent of emerging market stocks was more than 80 per cent.   Looking at the entire global stock universe outside the US, the proportion rises still further to more than 90 per cent. Winners have won big. Most individual stocks over the past 30 years have failed to outperform dollars stored under the mattress, let alone a local currency interest-bearing cash deposits ‚Äî even after taking into account dividends.   Bessembinder‚Äôs work has typically been surveyed in terms of what it means for active stockpickers ‚Äî with some seeing it as a rationalisation for chasing moonshots and others for pursuing passive index-investing. Less examined has been what it means for asset allocators.   Developed market stock index returns have been dominated by global companies ‚Äî even if they each carry a domestic tilt. As such, connecting local macroeconomic developments to the performance of a region‚Äôs equity index can be something of a dark art.   Single large stocks with an economic fate that has little to do with their listing jurisdiction have dominated national index returns. For example, the photolithography machine-maker ASML accounts for more than a fifth of the total net wealth created by Dutch stocks in the 30 years up to 2020. Global fast-fashion retailer Inditex accounts for more than a sixth of Spanish stock returns. Global luxury brands LVMH and L‚ÄôOr√©al collectively account for almost a quarter of the returns from French stocks. These are not outliers. One cannot explain long-term returns without reference to such companies in pretty much any region.   If it becomes hard to explain equity index returns without reference to specific superstar groups, it stands to reason that it must be even harder to forecast equity index returns without taking a view on some individual companies. It‚Äôs easy today to focus on whether the Magnificent Seven that have powered the S&amp;P 500 rally ‚Äî Apple, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta ‚Äî might stumble. With more than a quarter of the US market‚Äôs valuation riding on them, the question is not at all trivial. But 30 years ago, five of these seven had not even listed. It‚Äôs hard to take a view on companies that don‚Äôt yet exist.   I‚Äôve been as guilty as the next asset allocator in explaining my preference for US over European stocks or vice versa with reference to some domestic macroeconomic outlook. Given that financials, utilities and property groups will carry a strong domestic flavour, this is still forgivable.   But when constructing a long-term strategic asset allocation, it is becoming increasingly untenable to justify regional preferences with reference to local macroeconomic forecasts. This may explain why long-term return forecasts for equity markets ‚Äî or Capital Market Assumptions, as they are known ‚Äî have such a lousy record.   The biggest single investment decision any institutional or individual investor is likely to make in their portfolio is their choice of strategic asset allocation. To create a strategic asset allocation one must make reasonable guesses about future market returns. Bessembinder‚Äôs research shows quite how invariably such reasonable guesses will be blindsided by the fate of single stocks.,;,; 2023-08-08 12:11:15]

[Market Cap + Dividend strategy, would this work?,;,; Hi everyone  **I. Disclaimers:**  1. I'm rather new to this sub and investing in general, and English is not my first language. This thread may be totally nonsensical and I am sorry if it turns out to be. But I hope to receive constructive criticisms because I wish to learn more from you guys. 2. I have a very limited coding background so I couldn't run a backtest on this strategy that I am proposing. I am hoping if you guys could help me verify if this investing strategy would have worked in the past. 3. Before I start, I have tested against SPY, SCHD and QQQ for a period of 2015-2023 on portfolio visualiser and my strategy seems to work. But the test wasn't extensive as I couldn't have a dynamic data to rebalance the % overtime, it would be a bad idea as I found out NVIDIA was not among the top LargeCap but they climbed tremendously over the past few years.  &amp;#x200B;  **II. Short hand notations:**  1. I will use basic short forms like **DCA**, for this post it would simply mean I invest **however much I could at the end of each month**, after sorting out other aspects of my finance. 2. Another set of short forms is LC for Large Cap, TLC for Top Largest Cap, **T1LC** is the **Top 1 Largest Cap**, T2LC for the Top 2 Largest Cap, and so on. 3. Suffice **wD** would mean **with Dividend**. T1LCwD would mean the Top 1 Largest Cap company that pays Dividend. 4. Prefix **a** would mean adjusted. I will introduce this concept in **III.A.** right below.  &amp;#x200B;  **III. So here is the strategy:**  **A. Rules and Criteria:** (I am probably using Excel to manually do this, please let me know if there is a better way. I really regret not taking my 3 years of uni Statistics seriously.)  1. I would update the data every month before the event I mentioned in **II.1** 2. I would take the Current Market Cap Total \* (1+DividendYield%) to get Adjusted Current Market Cap Total for each stock. 3. Sum up the Adjusted Current Market Cap Totals. 4. Find out the % weightage of each stock. 5. Resort them if needed. T1LCwD may not be the same as aT1LCwD because of the multiplication factor in 2.  I will explain deeper in part **B** (and even reset the rules because I don't have a large sum of money to buy all of these stocks).  *Note:*  1. *As aT1LCwD may cause confusion, I will sometime use* ***T1*** *instead.* 2. *I choose stocks wD because I noticed that these are relatively more stable than stocks woD, please counter me if it's dangerously wrong.* 3. *Even in bad crises, yeah you know the rest.*  **B. Algorithm:** (This is a crude skeleton of the plan, I will ignore trading fees for the time being)  1. I will buy 1 T1. 2. a. If buying a T2 will exceed the holding % than 1 T1 %, I will buy 1 more T1 and come back to Step 2.   b. If buying 1 T2 does not set my T2 at a higher holding % than my T1, buy 1 T2 and proceed to Step 3. 3. Iterate the steps for T3 and continue until my deposit depletes. 4. In the next month, check if there is any changes to the % on Excel, and carry on the algorithm.  &amp;#x200B;  **IV. Additional takes:**  1. The math in **III.A.2** can be modified using Machine Learning to optimise the model. Again I really regret not taking my stats course seriously so I can only use wishful thinking here. 2. This idea is completely opposite to the mean-reversion DCA strategy, where you invest monthly in an index, a bit more when the price drops, a bit less when the price increases. This was shared with me by a friend who I deem very smart and quite knowledgeable. But I find happiness in creating new ideas. 3. This is somewhat a self-correcting algorithm, in the case a new company is rising, it would include and increase the position. The companies that fall off will not yet be sold, they may bounce back. 4. I am aware that Fundalmental &gt; Technical and I should spend more time reading up financial reports and news.  I understand that, but I want to focus more time on my other aspects in life as the time goes by. 5. For some reason, when I tested with JNJ and it seems to be not too effective with this Dividend King. I will update on this if I can think of a reason why.,;,; 2023-04-22 19:47:12]

[Any way to capitalize on AI BESIDES NVDA?,;,; Looking for competitors in the AI space or companies whose products/services NVDA needs to keep pushing its AI further. Not looking to make quick money - was wondering if there are reputable companies that fit these criteria for the medium or long haul. Also not looking for true start ups. Thoughts?,;,; 2023-05-28 04:38:13]
[This post on NVDA from 8 months ago is a goldmine,;,; Have a read: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/14a512q/your\_opinion\_on\_nvda\_overvalued\_or\_not/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/14a512q/your_opinion_on_nvda_overvalued_or_not/)  I always enjoy reading comments on old threads like this where it shows no one can predict the future or price of a stock even if they are really confident.

[Your opinion on nvda, overvalued or not?,;,; What do people think of nvda?  It's now at 430$ and I think it's insanely overvalued.  I'm thinking of purchasing some long term puts on it, for example a 2 year expiration 365$ put for 59$, the share would have to be below 300$ in two years for this to be profitable.  But I'm looking for some other opinions.,;,; 2023-06-15 15:15:46]
[Is NVDA really over valued long term?,;,; Title says it. If you‚Äôre looking to hold for 10-40 years is NVDA really overvalued? Let‚Äôs take Apple for example. On September 28, 2018, AAPL hit an all time high of $56.44. It was followed by a steep fall to high $30s in late 2018. Almost a 30% decline. I‚Äôm sure it hurt investors at the time. And I‚Äôm sure a lot of people were kicking themselves saying ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have bought at all time highs when it‚Äôs so overvalued.‚Äù However, if they held for about 5 years until today they‚Äôre probably thrilled to have bought for $56.44. I‚Äôd personally load the boat with AAPL these days. Sure their return isn‚Äôt as high as it could have been but timing the market is all but impossible. My point is, if you‚Äôre bullish on a company for strong reasons. The risk of overvaluation/draw down should not keep you sitting on the side lines. Time in the market beats timing the market. If you‚Äôre not bullish on NVDA please explain why?,;,; 2024-02-14 01:26:55]

[Excellent analysis - NVDA,;,; This analyst has published the best analysis for Nvidia coming out of there Q2 earnings I have seen.  In fact, it's the best public analysis on the company I have seen in many many years.  tl:dr Nvidia likely to retain dominant position in AI ecosystem with strong growth ahead yet subject to normal periodic cycles of semiconductors.   Value is high, competition is at bay.   33FPE and with projected strong grown makes investment compelling against a basket of peers.  It's a long write up: [Nvidia opportunities and risks in the AI big bang](https://www.techfund.one/p/nvidia-opportunities-and-risks-in), frankly too long for many redditors with short attention spans.  But it **is well worth the time** for anyone who is interested in making money in AI or in understanding the state of the semiconductor landscape today.   Absolute must read.  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-09-03 19:42:46]
[Is there potential to short NVDA?,;,; I was taking a look at the general semiconductor industry and was surprised by the metrics of NVDA. The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years.   I also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning.  I do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows. However this valuation seems obscene and reminds me a lot of NVDA before the big sell of from its former valuation at similar levels.  Seems that going short through ITM or ATM long dated puts seems legitimate. What do you guys think?,;,; 2023-05-19 04:08:15]
[Seeking Advice on NVDA Investment Dilemma - Diversify, hedge or ride the wave?,;,;    I'm in a bit of a conundrum with my NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) investment and could really use some advice.  Currently, I own 50 shares of NVDA valued at around $30,000, purchased back in 2017 at $34 per share, with a cost basis of $1,700. This stock has seen unbelievable growth since then of over 1600% and now constitutes 45% of my non-taxable investment account and roughly 20% of all my investment accounts, excluding my home.  Last year, I sold about $5000 worth of NVDA to diversify, but I'm torn about what to do next. On one hand, the stock has been on a tear, and their future looks extremely promising with AI advancements and the huge demand for chips going forward. However, I'm aware of the need to diversify, as well as the risk of the stock taking a massive downturn and significantly hurting my net worth. There are also tax considerations if I sell, since I'll be on the hook for some significant capital gains tax.   For some context, I'm a married man with two kids, a house with $200k in equity and a $200k mortgage. I have around $80k in IRA accounts and $65k in taxable brokerage accounts amd some cash on hand for emergency fund etc. Little debt otherwise.   Any advice on whether to sell and diversify, ways to mitigate risks, or hedging strategies would be greatly appreciated. How should I navigate this situation, considering the potential tax bill, its outsized share of my portfolio and the promising future for NVDA?

[Nvidia shares spike 26% on huge forecast beat driven by A.I. chip demand,;,; https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2024.html  Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings for its fiscal 2024 on Wednesday, with a stronger-than-expected forecast that drove shares up 26% in extended trading.  Here's how the company did versus Refinitiv consensus estimates for the quarter ended in April:  EPS: $1.09, adjusted, versus 92 cents expected Revenue: $7.19 billion, versus $6.52 billion expected Nvidia said it expected sales of about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%, in the current quarter, more than 50% higher than Wall Street estimates of $7.15 billion.  Prior to the after-hours move, Nvidia stock was up 109% so far in 2023, mostly driven by optimism stemming from the company's leading position in the market for artificial intelligence chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the company was seeing "surging demand" for its data center products.  Nvidia's data center group reported $4.28 billion in sales, versus expectations of $3.9 billion, a 14% annual increase. Nvidia said that performance was driven by demand for its GPU chips from cloud vendors as well as large consumer internet companies, which use Nvidia chips to train and deploy generative AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT.  Nvidia's strong performance in data center shows that AI chips are becoming increasingly important for cloud providers and other companies that run large numbers of servers.  However, Nvidia's gaming division, which includes the company's graphics cards for PC sales, reported a 38% drop in revenue to $2.24 billion in sales versus expectations of $1.98 billion. Nvidia blamed the decline on a slower macroeconomic environment as well as the ramp up of the company's latest GPUs for gaming.  Nvidia's automotive division, including chips and software to develop self-driving cars, grew 114% year over year, but remains small at under $300 million in sales for the quarter.  Net income for the quarter was $2.04 billion, or 82 cents a share, compared with $1.62 billion, or 64 cents, during the year-earlier period. Nvidia's overall sales fell 13% from $8.29 billion a year ago.  *Personal take*: I don‚Äôt even know what to say, this is simply astonishing. The AFH price puts NVDA at 20% above its previous ATH. This jump would have been insane even for 2021, let alone the tech market of 2023.  AI will be the main focus and the main buzzword for the entire tech industry for the next few years, and I expect many companies to pivot toward that one way or another (even if it‚Äôs just paying PR lip service) in order to catch the wind in the sail.,;,; 2023-05-25 02:13:21]

[Infamous letter from Sun Microsystems CEO to shareholders after DotCom burst,;,; Sun peaked at a $200bn market cap in 2000, then crashed and was finally sold for $7bn to Oracle a decade later. Their Price to Revenue ratio at the peak was only 10!  They had actual decent revolutionary products too:  From Java programming language to SPARC processors, StarOffice, MySQL, Solaris OS, VirtualBox &amp; ZFS! They were involved in all important areas of tech.  This is what the CEO wrote to bagholders:  ‚ÄúAt 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes which is very hard. And that assumes¬†you pay no taxes on your dividends which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&amp;D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64?

[Some historical perspective on Nvidia's valuation,;,; As we all know, Nvidia jumped 25% in a day on Thursday, one of the [largest single day](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-25/nvidia-nvda-on-track-for-record-219-billion-surge-in-market-value) market cap gains in history. Now up ~175% YTD, in a market that has rallied strongly since the start of the year, with AI being the hot new thing, there is talks of Nvidia (and AI in general) being a bubble. That Nvidia is overvalued.  But I want to point this out: despite the 25% jump in price this week, NVDA shares actually got **cheaper** on a forward P/E basis.  https://i.imgur.com/xPQR2OF.png  Prior to the report, it was traded at ~60x forward earnings. After the report, it trades at ~50x. And that 50x is only ~1 standard deviation away from it's 5 year average range.  This relative valuation holds for pretty much every metric  https://i.imgur.com/iMejuuf.png  Relative to it's peers, Nvidia, despite the massive single day jump, doesn't trade much more than above it's historical average.  https://i.imgur.com/4nP2u9w.png  Why is this? Because in hindsight, analyst expectations were somehow *too low*.  One year forward revenue grew from ~$30B to ~$40B, a 33% jump  Two year forward revenue went from ~$37B to ~$50B, a 35% jump  One year forward EPS went from ~$4.55 to ~$7, a 55% jump  Two year forward EPS went from ~$6.50 to ~$9.60, a 46% jump  2025 operating profit expectations a week ago were $16.6B. After reporting, now $27B  Forward gross margins went from 67.5% to 70.5%  Forward free cash flow went from $11.4B to $20.4B  I know it sounds like beating a dead horse here, but Nvidia just gave guidance that is them screaming that a transformational change is incoming.  Will the stock continue to keep going up every day? Of course not. But the calls of Nvidia being overvalued based simply on price action is ignoring the fundamental shift.,;,; 2023-05-27 23:33:44]

However I'm coming to the point where I want to buy a home in a year or two, and I'm realizing most of my savings is in retirement accounts and not easily accessible to me. Especially seeing stocks like AAPL and NVDA over the past decade, I'm kicking myself for not investing a good chunk in a few individual stocks a while ago which would have helped me raise a good cash savings today. My options now for raising a downpayment are either withdrawing my Roth IRA contributions, take a loan against my 401k, or saving it slowly the hard way, none of which are ideal. So this is more a warning to young people to not blindly follow advice to max out your retirement accounts, because you may have other short term goals (house, etc.) that come up that may require a chunk of savings to be available.

[Nvidia reminds me of Cisco during dotcom.,;,; **Note**: This post is *descriptive* of my personal observations and is for discussion purposes only. It is neither *predictive* in what will happen next nor is it *prescriptive* in suggesting any course of investment actions.   I've only done [3 predictive posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/s/pAtSiWhCXo) on this sub and this won't be one of them.  For those who are too young to remember that time:  There was this new thing called "the Internet", and it was going to forever change the world (it eventually did), and every company that hypes up some sort of "internet tech" (could be simple landing page that sells stuff, i.e Pets.com) received sky high valuation.   And there was one company behind it that made it all possible: Cisco, the company that sells industrial routers and switches to telecom providers that power the backbone of the entire internet infrastructure, was *obviously* a company that was "selling shovels during a gold rush" and would take over the whole world.   Its share price went up 236% from Jan.1999 to March 2000, reached a valuation of $500B+ (record high for a company back then), P/E went through the roof but it didn't matter because the *Internet Revolution^TM* was *just beginning* (and it was), so naturally Cisco's share price could only go higher.  The cherry on the top was that back then the **top two** companies were *Microsoft* and *Cisco*, one would provide the software (**Internet Explorer baby!**) and the other would sell the hardware. Together they would rule the world!  Now if you replace "Internet" with "AI", and "Cisco" with "Nvidia", keep Microsoft as it is (but replace "IE" with ChatGPT"), and we have quite a mirror version of what's happening today.  Then we all know what happened. Cisco obviously survived the bubble burst and remains profitable and is still doing fine today, but $CSCO *never* recovered back to its dotcom bubble peak after crashing 80% during the dotcom bust, 23 years later.  Now will the same thing happen with $NVDA? Like I said I don't know and I'm not making any predictions. All I can say is that I see a lot of parallels *so far*.  **Edit**: For people replying to me arguing how you can't mine Bitcoins using network switches or how Cisco didn't do AI, *no kidding*, at no point did I claim the two companies are identical and sell the same things, that would be idiotic.

[ELI5: how can I get a ~5% risk free return?,;,; I've always invested in broad market ETF's, with a few individual stocks mixed in like AAPL and NVDA.  Now that the interest rate is high, I want to mix in about 20% of risk-free investments (bonds/cd's etc) into my portfolio, but I don't know where to start.  What's the easiest and best way to do this?  For instance, is there something like an ETF for bonds which is easy to buy and sell and gets close to the fed interest rate?  And what are the basics someone should know about getting into this type of investment?,;,; 2023-07-22 13:02:12]
[My strategy has been "wrong" for the last decade (Intl vs US). Will I continue to be wrong in the next decade?,;,; I made a decision 10+ years ago to invest heavily in international. IXUS is my largest holding. My logic at the time was that since I live and work in the U.S., international investing would be a bit of a hedge. International was also much cheaper on about every metric CAPE, PE, P/B etc. as it remains today.  Of course I've only gotten punished for my decision since then with the U.S. continuing to outperform. But when I bat around the idea of making changes now I find it hard to swallow that the U.S. will continue to outperform again for another 10 years. Am I crazy to stick with a portfolio heavily weighted towards intl?  I've got Fidelity ETFs but I'm sure the numbers are close for Vanguard:  IXUS: P/E of 13, yield of 2.3%, P/B of 1.7  ITOT: P/E of 21, yield of 1.4%, P/B of 3.7  Like what is more likely, the rest of the world seeing 50% multiple expansion to get to a P/E of 19.5 or the U.S. seeing the same to get to a PE of 31.5 or choose your own favorite scenario/metric. Maybe the numbers would get a little closer if you were to strip out the high flyers like AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, etc. I have been building out a position in SCHD to help get a little more balance but am I nuts to stay the course?   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;   ,;,; 2023-08-16 20:30:06]
[At what point will index fund investing stop working?,;,; The money in an index fund is used to purchase shares of all the equities in the index. The underlying intrinsic value and performance of those equities will never be considered by the shareholders.  As many are quick to point out, most big cap stocks are currently heavily overpriced. For example, [Pepsi](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PEP?p=PEP) currently costs $38.67 per $1 of profit today. Who would pay that price for a company that only [grows](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PEP/analysis?p=PEP) ~8% per year at best? Its top three [shareholders](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/PEP/holders?p=PEP) are Vanguard, State Street and Black Rock.  How much of the blame for overpricing goes to passive investors who shovel money into everything regardless of its value or performance? I'm perfectly guilty of this myself of course.  Passive investors dream of cashing out on that compounded 9.1%/year growth of the S&amp;P 500 over time, and we can all backtest and see that past performance. But we can't really backtest the ever-increasing observer effect that index investing must have over time.  To get to the point, at what point does the S&amp;P 500 simply track the performance of index funds and render the stock market a meaningless Ponzi scheme? Or have I simply gone bonkers to think about this, and if so, what am I missing?  Charlie Munger has often [pointed out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tojx4J2HYD4) that index investing doesn't work if everyone does it. Are any economists studying the notion that index investing itself is poisoning the market averages that seem harder and harder for stock pickers to beat every decade?,;,; 2023-06-04 00:14:39]
[Starting a new portfolio...,;,; If you were starting a new portfolio today, what would your five picks be?   I've been digging into a making a new portfolio for 2024 to build for a long term hold (5-10 year hold with no liquidation events before 5 years). My group of friends have a chat about picks and we landed on Palantir at $9 and are happy about that and also shorted TSLA around year end (thanks Elon) so no problems with small spec plays or "contrarian" takes.

Companies such as Apple, Samsung, Intel and Nvidia have been reported to buy into this company to get some control.  Let's talk about this opportunity. What's people sentiment about this IPO?

I seriously don't feel like much upside from here   Yeah, maybe I could make a few thousand before another major pullback in February and March, but what's the point?  I realize a lot don't sell due to taxes, but like I said, I don't have that worry so why should I hold and see my gains evaporate and then have no more significant cash to buy if we get some serious sales in February or March like I think we will?    I've been watching Mad Money and Cramer has been saying "you should take some gains cause the big money won't start buying mag 7 till they sell off more"  I think that's true.  I.made really good gains in nvda. I bought in at $144 a year and a half ago and I'm up to $490 a share, but it's been topping at $495 or so and then staying in range.  I've also been heavy msft aapl googl asml and lrcx and have very significant gains.  Don't see any reason that any stocks are going to go higher in the next few months till at least April if that.  Sure, maybe oil and utilities and industrials will go slightly higher but I think big money is waiting for the mag 7s to fall.  Anyone else going heavy cash right now?  Yes I'm an investor, but you have to be smart and to me sitting in the market at a top is not really smart, especially if you can sell with no tax consequences.   Good luck all.

[Talk me out of buying DIS,;,; Most of us if we had a time machine we would go back in time and buy AAPL, TSLA, NVDA. Well, I look at DIS ant notice it is trading at the same level as it was in 2014. So without the time machine, there is a chance to travel back 9 years and buy a blue chip stock?  I don't want to get into the politics of it. Quite candidly I'm conservative and support the FL laws. To me that is unrelated to the value here long term.  Reality is I just don't see DIS as a brand that is at any risk of liquidation or collapse; quite the opposite I see they could be primed for growth. They have their hands in several facets of the economy. Media, entertainment. They own some of the most iconic brands, if you want around the world and asked people to draw a picture of what they think of when they think of America, I bet either the mouse ears or McDonalds logo would be at the top.  Looking at the 2014 price, if the company has grown at just 6% a year that would put their stock price at $138 presently, so over 50% higher than the present value.  I think the end of the writers strike will help their stock, and I think a change in leadership will help their stock and I know Iger just came back on the scene and signed a new contract but at his age I could see the board making a change since their stock has continued to plunge upon his return.

[I think the owner of the company I work for is stuck in a ponzi scheme. How to proceed?,;,; Anonymous one time post. I handle the financials for a guy and his multiple companies. The owner of the company I work for has an investment broker, he's been around for a handful of few years. Almost every month (more in recent months than previously) the broker tells him he can get him a 30% return, the minimum he can buy in for every month is a million - which he takes in towards the end of every month. The owner has invested many millions and gets an interest check at the beginning of every month. I talk with both the owner and the broker fairly regularly. I was told that an extra million invested increases the monthly interest by about $23k - so annually that's about 28%. The broker has made comments such as, "I have up to $10M available for this investment this month". I don't know what it's actually invested in - although he does get a statement, I just haven't looked close enough at what it's invested in (although if it truly is a ponzi scheme, the statement very well could be fake). The owner has mentioned this to many other professionals he works with and many of them have reached out to me about how it's very fishy. I met the investment broker once, as did one of these other professionals, and we both had the same reaction - the broker is very arrogant, super questionable, and just comes off as a complete scum bag.  The broker is listed on the website for a major investment bank. He's listed on Advisor Check and Broker Check and has what looks like a clean record - over a dozen years experience with multiple firms, multiple exams passed, licensed in 30+ states.   Am I thinking wrong here? I just can't believe the return, it's completely unrealistic. It's also odd that the minimum is $1m and the guy is trying to sell more investments at the end of every month, then paying out interest at the beginning of every month - seems a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul. I've thought about making an anonymous tip to the SEC, but I feel like I'm risking a lot by doing so. I don't even know how to approach this. In my mind there's no chance this is legit, but at the same time, the interest checks have been coming in without issue. And what about the Broker Check stuff and doing everything under a major investment bank? I don't know enough about those things.,;,; 2024-02-14 03:04:36]

[Index fund vs top 10 S&amp;P Stocks?,;,; The first thing I did when I started my investment journey a while back was set up an S&amp;P500 index fund and invest monthly in it. I now know more about the stock market and trading/investing in general.   My question basically is would I be better off taking the accumulated funds from the fund and just allocating it into the top 10 stocks like AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA, NVDA etc? Is there any real benefit of using an index fund?  The only thing I can think of is I would probably be unable to use a Stock and Shares ISA (equivalent to a Roth IRA, I think) as my index fund uses GBP even though the fund tracks US stocks. To my understanding as soon as I make investments in USD I can no longer use the ISA. From the UK for context.  EDIT: Thank you all for your input.

[Offsetting Previous Losses While Continuing to Invest for the Future,;,; Hello, I am looking for some advice on smart investment strategies to offset my previous $100k loss against my recent capital gains for tax purposes.        In 2020 and 2021, I made some poor decisions by getting involved in risky options trading without fully understanding the downsides. Over time, I ended up losing around $100,000 from these trades (short-term). It was completely due to my own ignorance and mistakes. After 2021, I realized option trading was not appropriate for me, so I stopped all forms of trading to focus on my career. Over the next six months, I worked hard to improve my skillset for better career opportunities and landed a well-paying job with potential growth prospects. In early 2023, I invested $70k into NVDA, NFLX, GOOGL, and AAPL stocks. Fortunately, that $70,000 investment is now worth around $112k. I also received $17k worth of vested RSUs from my current employer which is now worth around $20k.        Additional Info:   * Married couple (36M, 32F) with a 3-year-old child, living in California (rented).  * Combined household income is \~$420k ($370k base salary + $50k RSUs).  * Retirement Savings: 401k - $300k; Taxable Investments - $120k; Vested RSUs - $20k + $55k (spouse)  * 529 College Savings Plan - $7k, contribute $3k per year.   Previous Capital Losses:   * In last 2 years, deducted $6k capital losses on tax returns.  * Have $94k remaining capital losses carried forward per 2022 tax filing.   Questions:   1. If I sell my NVDA, NFLX, GOOGL, AAPL shares with $42k ($112k-$70k) capital gains, the gains would be offset by my carried forward losses from previous years and I would not owe any taxes on it. The remaining $52k ($94k-$42k) losses could still be carried forward. Is this understanding, correct?  2. Does it make sense to realize the $42k short term capital gains to offset against losses, even though normally I'd owe taxes on short term gains?  3. Is it advisable to sell my vested RSUs, realizing $3k capital gains, to also offset against my carried forward capital losses? This would leave me with $49k ($52k-$3k) losses still.  4. Would the gains from my $300k Fidelity T-bills (maturing Mar/Apr 2024) also be eligible to offset against capital losses? If not, should I buy more T-bills after maturity? Context - I plan to use this for a house purchase downpayment in mid-2025.  5. For short term savings goals (1-1.5 years), are T-bills the optimal way to get guaranteed returns? Given my losses, are there better alternatives with comparable returns I should consider?  6. I'm unsure how investments like VUSXX, SGOV, BIL, USFR, TFLO compared to T-Bills in Fidelity. Could I purchase these instead for short term savings goals? Would these help recover my losses faster?  7. I know my losses carry forward each year deducting $3k in taxes until fully utilized. Without offsetting gains, it would take 31+ years at $3k/year ($94k/3k). If there is any advice on any other ways to recover these losses faster, kindly feel free to suggest.,;,; 2024-01-16 05:16:09]
[Should I invest the money I'm saving for a down payment until I'm ready to buy?,;,; A little more context: My wife and I are saving up for a down payment for a house, and we're hoping to buy sometime in the next 2.5 - 4 years. And until we're ready to buy we also want our money to be making money for us over while we wait.   Our first thoughts were to keep our future down payment savings in one or two HYSAs earning about 4.5% APY since they're at a 15-year high. However, I know once the fed funds rate starts coming down, probably in the second half of this year, so will the rates for HYSAs. Another option we've considered is putting our down payment savings into CDs which will lock in a better rate (\~5.4%) for a year even if the fed funds rate goes down.   I've also considered putting some of our savings into a brokerage account and using it to invest in the S&amp;P 500 (likely FXAIX) and letting it grow over the next 2+ years. This could have greater returns. But of course we then run the risk of losing some of that money if the market drops.   Any thoughts and opinions are welcome.,;,; 2024-02-13 03:29:12]
[Is it normal for a brokerage to sell more stocks than needed to satisfy a margin call?,;,; I'm hoping to get some clarity from the community here on the dynamics of margin calls.  My account was recently hit with a margin call. I'm familiar with margin calls and how there is a potential for the broker to sell your shares to satisfy the call if you don't make a deposit quickly enough. Well I missed the email alerting me there was margin call on my account and they did just that. My issue is they sold $6000 worth of stock to satisfy a $1500 margin call. To make matters worse it was NVDA stock which took a giant dump the last few weeks and is now recovering. They essentially diminished my position on one of my better performing stock while it was at one of its lowest points for the year.   Has anyone else had a brokerage sell your stocks under the pretense of a margin call only to sell more than what was needed? The excess was left just sitting in the account for what appears as, no reason.  Is this normal? Punitive?,;,; 2023-11-14 23:41:09]

[TSM - a technical play on chips, AI.,;,; [https://imgur.com/a/rDH6N9G](https://imgur.com/a/rDH6N9G)  For those not in the know TSM fabs like 50% of apple chips, all NVDA chips. They are the most sophisticated chip fabrication plant on the globe.   TSM is hanging right around the bottom of the channel of the uptrend.   now this is a solid company, solid financials, 2% annual dividend, diversifying into arizona (with struggles) and germany (with both comes a lesser ability to produce chips than the main Taiwan factory), which removes **some** of the risk of being solely in Taiwan. Maybe a japan factory as well?  If you bought around 93-92 dollars, set a stop loss at say 87 or 86 being a significant break in trend, or maybe even as low as 84 or 83, a real break in the trend, you would lose somewhere between 6.5% to 10%.   now if TSM continues the uptrend and we go to 100 you are up 7.5%  if we go to 105 youre up 12.9%  if TSM suprasses a high on its trip down in 2022 around 109 to hit 110, you're up 18.2%  and it just continues up from there, i mean you hit 115 and the risk reward is totally worth it. So you're a long term holder buying into the bottom of the uptrend and setting a stop loss around 88-87, 5-6% risk to make maybe 20% on the high upside, maybe 12.9-7.5 on the lowside.   its a decent bet.   full disclosure i think hanging around the bottom of the trend shows a little uncertainty but it also is opportunity for you. i bought days ago.   &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-09-04 03:22:59]

TSM  went down, it made a low that was still a bit higher than its prior low, then it continued in the uptrend and made a new high. 115.  i think theres still value here. you get a pull back, especially anything south of 100 dollars, i think you could see 145 again on this stock easily over the next year if semiconductor sales stay good, which they likely will.  semiconductors are the new oil. tech is not stopping. tech runs off data and computing. data and computing are done by chips. chips need semiconductors.  diversify into ASML (i buy FEZ on RH to get diversified exposure, which is inefficient.)  buy the other foundrys INTL and SAMSUNG (I buy EWY on RH to get exposure).  find a packaging company, i buy AMKR because they do packaging and testing.  Buy other design if you want - amd, i dont. Buy NVDA if you want, i dont i own it through indexes (spy on RH spx would be better otherwise) and etfs (VOOG).  buy the coding languages ARM or some alternative.  Buy the entire supply chain.

[What to do with stock based compensation?,;,; Hey guys I was reading over some company filings as earnings season is in effect and I had an accounting question.  Free cash flow is typically found by just taking the operating cash flow and subtracting the general expenses (CAPEX) following all operation activity. However, stock based compensation gets included into operating cash flow activities and therefore adds to the free cash flow total.  This led me to wonder if I should subtract the stock based compensation from the total cash flow as stock based compensation is actually just a non-cash expense of the business and does dilute existing shareholders. This is shockingly significant however as many newer and mostly tech companies generate ridiculous amounts of there cash flow from stock based compensation which is extremely deceptive (ex. ADSK, TEAM, PLTR, NVDA).  This led me to ask if it makes sense to subtract stock based compensation from cash flow , include it in cash flow, or something else.  What do you guys think?,;,; 2023-05-26 00:16:49]
[40% of asset allocation is a single stock,;,; I invest for long term and don't expect to do anything with my investment for the next 20 years as I also keep a decent reserve on a savings account.      I invest in a mix of index funds and mainly in All world but a small percentage goes to emerging markets and small cap. However from the total asset allocation 40 percent is a single stock. It's the company I work for. I buy stocks because my employer adds almost 18% on top off every stock purchase I make. This makes it interesting because it's "free" money.   My company hasn't done great in the last years and still doesn't but I mainly bought on lows and I keep buying more monthly. I have a 12% return on my investment but it's actually more because part of my investment is paid by my employer.

[How to get rid of my trading habit to invest properly! Fear of losing the money!!,;,; I have built trading habit/mindset for many years due to lot of fear of losing the money, esp retirement account.  Over the past, I developed this habit of selling ETFs like QQQ/SMH and buying them back. This way, I secured my money (no loss) since 2021 December but a little gain appx 5% or less.  Even though I spot deep low good spot, I buy them some 10% or 20% of cash and sell them early to book profit, never had a guts to hold it.  Most of the times, I am missing the boat, continuous growth. I still feel bearish and trading then and there.  I recently tried bonds like TLT, but it went down from $98 to $95 range, sold it. I recently bought  APLY (thinking low volatility) around $19.5 but sold today by fear of losing money. When I buy, I think of hold long, but when I see nice jump or profit, my fear increases, selling it.  In my past, I bought TSLA at $41, NVDA at $55, FB at $50 and GOOGL $120. Had I kept those, I would have been multi millionaire by now, but sold everything with trading mindset.  Many of my friends told me, even close friend holding AAPL since 1998,  that trading not good, and try to make investing habits, but still my mind does not accept seeing huge negative on my account, say loss $10000.  I am mid 50s and naturally fear of losing money is common, but is trapped by trading mindset which I want to get rid of.  Read many books like Intelligent investor, Margin of safety etc and also reading many books, but that does not remove my fear of losing money.  I do not know whether I will be able to come out of not. If some one experienced like this and came out of that issue, please let me know how to get out of that.

[Mutual 'Fun' for my 3yo Son,;,; So for my son's first birthday (three years ago) I thought it would be fun to invest $1K and see where it would be when he turned 21. I asked all of his relatives to pick any stock or whatever, and then I bought fractional shares to spread out the $1K. I have a record of each initial stock purchase price (people picked everything from stuff that was hot then like NET, SPCE and PLTR to things they thought he'd identify with as he got older like DIS and NKE). Others played it safe and picked mutual funds. Anyway, the 'purity' of the initial $1K is gone because I've added more money (in small amounts) as people have given additional monetary birthday gifts etc. So now I have an imbalanced mishmash. I've been putting the 'new' money in safe places -- specifically VOO, SPY and BRKB. The total is still only about $2K but over the next 18 years I expect to continue to put modest amounts in and I am curious what people think. Should I hammer one mutual fund or spread it around?

[Active Managers of r/investing...did you beat your bogie this year? If so, how come? If not, how come?E,;,; Especially interested to hear from the managers who missed their bogie and the reasons why?  Me, with a few days left in the year have underperformed the S&amp;P by about 10 basis points.  I was down bad early in the year based on a large underweight to the magnificent seven and a large merger arbitrage bet that went sour.  I was also in an out of the benchmark position in pimco California municipal bond cefs which took a hit when Pimco out of nowhere cut distributions and prices tanked.    I made a lot of changes to my portfolio this year eliminating all bonds and going 100% stocks as this is a taxable account.  I put all the bonds in my IRAs.    I was also heavily overweighted to dividend stocks at the beginning of the year which contributed to my underperformance.  I dumped some of those and lowered allocations to others which allowed me to substantially increase my allocation to tech and the mag 7.  I still am underweight the mag 7, especially apple but am overweight certain software stocks and semiconductor stocks.   Making these changes allowed me to catch up to the index by the end of the year after being down close to 600 basis points at the halfway point.,;,; 2023-12-26 04:30:36]

Since Technology makes up 50% of QQQM, is it safe to say that QQQM performance is driven mainly by the technology sector?  And if you compare it to VGT's performance, which is 100% technology, you will see that the correlation is almost identical while VGT has out performed QQQM. VGT is 50% Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia.   If you make up a portfolio of Apple+Microsoft+nvidia, you will see a matching correlation again with VGT and QQQM only an even higher performance than VGT.  Can we conclude: Apple/MSFT/NVD &gt; VGT &gt; QQQM ?  And if one is chasing the QQQM performance, they're better off just buying  Apple/MSFT/NVD ?,;,; 2024-01-10 17:42:12]

[How Nasdaq 100 ‚ÄòSpecial Rebalance‚Äô on July 24 will affect tech stocks,;,; On July 7 [Nasdaq announced](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/the-nasdaq-100-index-special-rebalance-to-be-effective-july-24-2023-2023-07-07) its third-ever 'special rebalance' of the Nasdaq 100 index, which will take effect July 24, 2023.  As a result of the rebalance, you should expect Nasdaq to [significantly decrease the weight of the largest stocks](https://www.tastylive.com/news-insights/everything-you-need-to-know-about-what-will-happen-to-the-nasdaq-after-the-special-rebalance) ($MSFT, $AAPL, $GOOGL/$GOOG, $NVDA, and $AMZN) from a total of 43+% to below a 38.5% maximum. TSLA may also see a small downward weighting. Smaller stocks should see a small increase in the weight.  ETFs/mutual funds that try to follow the Nasdaq 100 (such as $QQQ) will need to adjust their holdings accordingly. So you should expect them to sell the largest stocks and buy the smaller ones -- perhaps they already have -- and that will affect the prices of those stocks accordingly.  It also means that those ETFs/mutual funds will not accurately reflect the relative weight of the largest stocks. So if you wish to be weighted according to actual market cap, you would need to supplement those holdings.  Normally the index rebalances every quarter. But the largest stocks are dominating the index and funds that follow the index need to maintain compliance with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule on fund diversification. On July 3, the largest six stocks saw their combined weight reach 50.9% of the index.

[Adding top companies on top of index funds?,;,; I am receiving a good sum of money and I am looking to start positions in some index funds. I'm cost averaging down over the next 2 years but I am also considering adding additional position in the top 5 individual companies. Considering that the top 5 companies are responsible for a large portion of the S&amp;P's growth I feel having slightly more exposure to these guys would be better and I also think that the bigger market cap's are going to be the ones that benefit from AI the most. I'm obviously interested in AI and trying to learn as much as I can but there is a massive amount of hype involved right now and I don't think a lot of these smaller AI companies will survive so I'm waiting them out before I start adding tech and pure AI plays. I started getting interested in markets 2 years ago and actually switch my college degree focus to finance. I have an opportunity to start building my own portfolio which is great so I'm wondering what everyone thinks of adding additional shares in the top 5 on top of the index funds? It's a pretty simple approach and I feel if the top 5 companies typically drive the S&amp;P then I might as well get 100 percent exposure to them. I would look at doing 90 percent into index funds and 10 percent into the top 5 companies and will be holding for the next 10 to 20 years.   ,;,; 2023-08-08 18:49:35]
[1.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,;,; I was only planning on giving annual updates but opted to give this 18-month update, given the changes I made a couple of months ago to rebalance my portfolio.  As a recap, I bought several ‚Äòpandemic stocks‚Äô following the dip in 2022. I gave a 1-year update in mid-2023 here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)  I planned on holding all of them longer, but 1) the recent boom in AI forced me to consider a rebalance and 2) strong (IMO somewhat unjustified) continued appreciation gave me a good opportunity to exit. The timing was fortunate since there was a correction after I sold.  Below is a summary of what I sold and the realized gain/loss.  **Summary**  There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I‚Äôve summarized each with the overall realized gain at the time of the sale in Q3:  * Affirm (AFRM): +18.09% * Allbirds (BIRD): +6.89% * Coinbase (COIN): +6.42% * Carvana (CVNA): +845.57% * Peloton (PTON): -71.51% * Snapchat (SNAP): -1.99%  All realized gains/losses were long-term (capital gains rate) except Carvana (CVNA) and Allbirds (BIRD).  I know these are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I‚Äôd like to maintain some anonymity around it.  Though Peloton lost a significant amount of value, it was a relatively small investment and was more than offset by the unprecedented gains with Carvana (saved by the meme).  **How I reinvested the proceeds**  The AI boom drove this sale, and I reinvested the proceeds mostly in NVIDIA (NVDA).  This was hard for me personally since I initially passed on buying NVIDIA at \~$110/share in October 2022 (I don‚Äôt know why), and at the time of the purchase, it was in the $400s following the strong run-up in 2023.  Most analysts said it was overpriced and it‚Äôd have to perform perfectly to achieve anything near that valuation.  However, working in tech broadly and with AI products in particular, my gut told me that there was still plenty of upside given their moat thanks to CUDA, among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/). So I pulled the trigger and purchased a significant amount of NVIDIA stock (all proceeds, plus more) and a smaller amount of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC). I passed on the [Arm IPO](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/14/technology/arm-ipo-stock-market.html), now down about 20% from its IPO peak.  I tentatively plan to give the 2-year update in another 6 months, plus or minus. For reference, the 1-year update from earlier this year is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1\_year\_followup\_on\_buying\_the\_dip\_on\_pandemic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/147v53k/1_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/)  **EDIT:** Corrected a typo to change 2021 to 2022.

[S&amp;p 500 Tech vs NASDAQ 100 vs Stocks for AI,;,; Greetings!     I wanna invest into AI and cant decide whats the best call there. I think most will agree that the best bet for AI is to invest into the Big Companys: Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Meta, Google and Amazon. (Tesla not included because i dont like Elon tbh).     Investing into S&amp;P Tech will give me big Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA but not the other companys. Investing into NASDAQ 100 will give me all of them, but with a lower Rate (can be good can be bad). And of course i just can buy those 6 Stocks.     I think Apple (even if they dont have LLMs yet) will be big in AI in 1-2 Years and the capability shipping local AI on all of their devices are insane.  Huge potential here + we talk about Apple. Microsoft is playing the AI game better than anyone else right now and coming GPT Versions will slap. I also like the new approach of Meta and with LLAMA there is also huge Potential. NVIDIA is of course also a no brainer (even if some ppl think they are overvalued), they are way ahead of other companys like AMD right now. Amazon while not having insane LLMs right now, has of course on of the best Sectors to apply AI in general.     With alphabet i have to say, im not so sure. Their new Model is strong, but i kinda didn't feel good about the company as a whole. Hard to explain why.      What would you do and why if AI is the goal ?

[The most crucial topic this week will involve corporate reports. Who are the leaders, and who are the laggards?,;,; Below, I'm offering up the sectors  that I believe have the greatest potential for improved financial  performance, as well as those that may disappoint investors.  I expect an increase in financial performance in the following areas:  1Ô∏è‚É£ Technology: Primarily, companies specializing in AI and hardware production.  ‚ñ™ **Nvidia (NVDA)** graphics cards remain highly popular among users, while **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)** and **Intel (INTC)** may also signal a recovery in demand. AI product creators **Alphabet (GOOG)** and **Microsoft (MSFT)** could also see increased demand for their products in the coming quarters, boosting profits.  2Ô∏è‚É£  Cryptocurrency companies: Rising prices for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and  other coins are likely to boost profits from commissions for the **Coinbase** crypto exchange **(COIN)** and from the mining company **Marathon Digital (MARA)**.  3Ô∏è‚É£ Energy and precious metals mining:  ‚ñ™ Mineral prices (gold and silver) exhibited a growth trend in the reporting quarter. This could send profits for **Newmont (NEM)** and **Barrick Gold (GOLD)** soaring.  ‚ñ™ Increasing energy demand could result in higher revenues for **Peabody Energy (BTU)** and **Arch Resources (ARCH)**.  Laggards:  1Ô∏è‚É£ Financial: Tightening credit conditions and deposit outflows are likely to primarily impact regional banks such as **First Republic Bank (FRC)**. Large banks, including those with investment banking divisions like **Bank of America (BAC)** and **JP Morgan (JPM)**,  could benefit from deposit inflows and increased asset values in the  stock market. However, the quality of their loan portfolios is  deteriorating, and reserves are growing.  I'm not ready to add these shares to my portfolios, so I will continue to observe the dynamics of these stocks.  Additionally, the reports from **Wells Fargo (WFC)**, JP Morgan Chase, and **Citigroup (C)** showed decent results thanks to cost control and growth in net interest income.  2Ô∏è‚É£  Consumer: Stores, including online marketplaces, typically experience a  decline in demand in the 1st quarter following holiday sales. I  anticipate a drop in demand indicators from **Best Buy (BBY)**, **Walmart (WMT)**, **GAP (GPS)**, as well as **Bed Bath &amp; Beyond (BBBY)**, which faces bankruptcy.  3Ô∏è‚É£  Healthcare: The coronavirus pandemic and seasonal colds have subsided,  and the increased demand for drugs has dwindled. Medical companies such  as **Teva (TEVA)**, **Pfizer (PFE)**, and **Novavax (NVAX)** could increase spending on new drugs, which would impact shareholder returns negatively.  Conclusion:  Adding  a sector to one list or another doesn't necessarily mean that after the  report is presented, all of the stocks in promising sectors will soar  while all of those in the laggard category will tank. Rather, these are  thoughts on on the medium- and long-term growth prospects of specific  sectors in my field of vision.,;,; 2023-04-17 14:40:00]

There seems to be charges for each transaction in her 401K and she is currently signed up for the My Total Retirement Program.    3)	I think she would need to liquidate the Fidelity zero funds if she moved to Empower and that would be a taxable event.  Is that accurate?    4)	Most importantly, would it be worth it to move the Fidelity funds to Empower and have them manage it?  And if it is not worth it, should she stop the My Total Retirement program at Empower to save on fees and just keep running the self directed 401K?

[Nvidia Too Expensive Now or Still Okay to Buy?,;,; For record, I bought some Nvidia stock about 6 years ago, looking to now add and increase my position in it. Question is do you guys think it's now too expensive after going 10x these last couple of years or would it be okay to buy, in terms of valuation? Obviously no one knows the future, but figured I'd still ask to grab some opinions.   If I remember right, when I bought Nvidia about 6 years ago, it went up around 2-3x in 1 year as well, many telling me it was too expensive, but I purchased it anyway, knowing I was still in my early 20s and had time. Today it's gone up around 10x since, but question becomes, when is too much too much?,;,; 2023-12-19 08:08:03]

[NVIDIA beat earnings, top expectations.,;,; Nvidia reported its fiscal first quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom line on the strength of its data center business. The company also said it expects Q2 revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was expecting $7.2 billion.  Nvidia is at the center of the AI explosion thanks to its high-powered graphics cards and server products, and its stock price is soaring. Over the last year, shares of Nvidia have jumped 77%, while rival AMD has jumped 12%. Intel shares are down 30% in the same timeframe.  Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what was expecting, as compiled by Bloomberg.  Revenue: $7.2 billion versus $6.5 billion expected  Adj. EPS: $1.09 versus $0.92 expected  Gaming: $2.2 billion versus $1.9 billion expected  Data center: $4.2 billion versus $3.9 billion expected  Shares of Nvidia were up more than 13% following the announcement.  ‚ÄúThe computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions ‚Äî accelerated computing and generative AI,‚Äù Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.,;,; 2023-05-24 20:36:19]
[Nvidia hits $1 trillion market cap,;,; https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/30/nvidia-on-track-to-hit-1-trillion-market-cap-when-market-opens.html  Nvidia briefly hit a $1 trillion market cap at the open Tuesday, joining a small club of mostly technology companies. Nvidia‚Äôs shares have to hold above $404.86 to maintain that distinction throughout the day. The chipmaker‚Äôs stock rocketed last week after it posted quarterly earnings with top- and bottom-line numbers that significantly beat consensus estimates. Nvidia‚Äôs gain buoyed other chipmakers, with the notable exception of Intel, and was also fueled in part by estimates that were more optimistic than expected.  Significantly, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 alone. Expected sales were 50% higher than consensus estimates of $7.15 billion. It‚Äôs been a banner year for chipmakers, parts of the tech industry and the Nasdaq, driven in part by the AI frenzy and the possibility of slowing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Alongside Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were also buoyed in last week‚Äôs trading.  Nvidia‚Äôs graphics processing units, or GPUs, are critical to generative AI platforms like OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and Google‚Äôs Bard. The company has historically been a leader in the so-called ‚Äúdiscrete‚Äù or standalone GPU field, but until recently, many consumers thought of GPUs as primarily used for intensive gaming. The advent of crypto mining and AI has upended that belief, and GPU manufacturers and suppliers, including Nvidia, AMD and TSMC, have seen share prices rise significantly over the last few months. By contrast, Intel, which struggled with inventory issues and development challenges, has been historically focused on the chip market for central processing units, or CPUs. The company hasn‚Äôt shared, comparatively, in the wave of investor interest.,;,; 2023-05-30 13:56:48]

[Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company,;,; Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday. It‚Äôs the latest example of how the artificial intelligence boom has sent the chipmaker‚Äôs stock soaring.  Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google‚Äôs $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.  The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.  Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.  Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques ‚Äî such as transformer architecture ‚Äî used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.  Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a ‚Äúcode red‚Äù situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.  Nvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.

[Cathie Wood calls Nvidia stock 'overpriced' after missing 2023 rally,;,; Cathie Wood isn't buying the artificial intelligence hype at Nvidia (NVDA).        The founder of Ark Invest, and noted tech innovation investor, tweeted on Monday that the AI darling is now overpriced.       Nvidia shares have risen more than 30% since the company reported earnings on May 24, and the stock touched a $1 trillion dollar market cap on Tuesday.            Wood and Ark sold their holdings in Nvidia back in January. Since Nvidia's stock has more than doubled as investors have dubbed the company the clear leader in the AI chipmaking arms race. In just the past week, Nvidia announced revenue guidance that blew away Wall Street estimates and followed that news up with new AI-focused product launches.   It hasn't just been Nvidia stock soaring, either. On Friday, Marvell Technology (MRVL) said the company expects revenue attributable to AI to double the next year. Shares rose more than 30% on the news amid a broader AI-infused tech rally that's continued into Monday's trading session.   With the Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) now up more than 2.5% in the last five days, Wood argues there are going to be other winners in the AI space outside of Nvidia.   "Other companies with visionary leaders, strong global distribution and, perhaps most important, large-high-quality pools of proprietary data should be big #AI winners, with revenues and earnings surprising significantly on the high side of expectations during the years ahead," Wood tweeted.   There will be "dozens" of AI winners, according to Wood. But the one that stands out to Ark, as it often does, is Tesla (TSLA).   Wood argues that at six times revenue, Tesla stock is far cheaper than Nvidia's current 25 times revenue valuation.   "(Tesla) is the most obvious beneficiary of the recent breakthroughs in #AI, as it aims for an $8-10 trillion revenue TAM in autonomous mobility by 2030," Wood wrote.   With several positive headlines in the news of late including a growing relationship in China, Tesla shares are up more than 7% amid the broader tech rally.     Wood's Nvidia comments come as her flagship ETF, the Ark Innovation Fund (ARKK), has struggled to return to its pandemic dominance. The ETF skyrocketed during the risk-on bull market of 2020 with high-flying pandemic darlings like Tesla, Zoom (ZM), and even Nvidia contributing to gains.   But as the Federal Reserve enacted its most aggressive interest rate hike campaign in four decades, risky bets became less popular with investors. Some of Ark's top holdings, such as Zoom, Roku (ROKU), and Coinbase (COIN) are well off their pandemic highs.   The fund itself lost more than $1 billion in market cap in 2022 with shares falling nearly 67%.,;,; 2023-05-31 10:22:50]

[Nvidia board member dumps $48 million more in stock amid monster rally,;,; Harvey Jones, who has been on the board since 1993, has unloaded more than $76 million worth of Nvidia shares so far this month.  A longtime board member at Nvidia Corp. dumped more than $48 million worth of the chip maker‚Äôs shares earlier this week, cashing in on the stock‚Äôs recent surge.        Harvey Jones, who has been on the Nvidia NVDA, -0.80% board since 1993, sold nearly 120,000 shares of the company Tuesday at prices between $400 and $408.51, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made public Wednesday. He pocketed $48.3 million through the transaction, which took place with shares that he held in his living trust.  Jones, who is also the managing partner of private-investment entity Square Wave Ventures, holds 676,396 shares of Nvidia through the trust after Tuesday‚Äôs activity. He owns another 137,934 shares directly.       The latest transaction by Jones follows a move by the Nvidia director to unload 70,205 shares at an average price of $405 on June 2, according to a filing from earlier in the month.

[Mark Zuckerberg Says Meta Will Own Billions Worth of Nvidia H100 GPUs by Year End,;,; https://www.barrons.com/articles/zuckerberg-meta-nvidia-gpu-b0632fed  On Instagram Thursday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will have 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units and overall almost 600,000 H100 compute equivalent GPUs by the end of this year.  ‚ÄúOur long term vision is to build general intelligence, open source it responsibly, and make it widely available so everyone can benefit,‚Äù he wrote in the post. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre building massive compute infrastructure to support our future roadmap‚Äù for artificial intelligence. Zuckerberg also said he excited about Meta‚Äôs progress incorporating AI technology in other type of devices like its Ray Ban smart glasses.  Start-ups and enterprise have clamored for Nvidia ‚Äôs GPUs, or graphics processing units because they are well suited for the parallel computations needed for AI projects.  A Meta spokesperson declined to provide clarity on the timing of H100 purchases and on whether the other H100 equivalent GPUs consisted of other Nvidia GPU models or were from different third parties.  Nvidia declined to comment on the timing of Meta‚Äôs H100 purchases.  The H100 is Nvidia‚Äôs current top-of-line data center GPU and costs roughly $25,000 per GPU, according to a slide in an earlier company presentation that showed a 16 H100 GPU system costs $400,000.  Though, it is unknown at what price Meta can purchase the H100, a quantity of 350,000 at $25,000 per GPU comes to nearly $9 billion.

So here is my question: *why on earth isn't the Nvidia stock going up and up until there is quite literally not enough money in any investor's pocket anymore to buy another share?*  Do the people with money not understand what's going on? Nvidia has 0 competition and every single one of the richest people on earth is buying as many GPUs as they can, probably paying double/triple to get their hardware delivered first. This is happening right now as we speak.  Sooooooo ... uhm ... do only people that game 24/7 actually get what the AI revolution entails? Isn't it obvious? Are nerds with 10+ years of "experience" in their field the only people that can actually tell what's happening? Like do I have to be a hobby pilot for 10 years to see when a revolutionary invention is happening in the aerospace industry? Is everyone else blind to that? I'm confused. Do people always think they are being tricked when it comes to stocks? You could have had a nerdy friend working in machine learning and he could have told you everything that's going down now back in 2019.  If I understand this correctly, then the only reason Nvidia stock isn't rising every week is because people think they are being tricked by nerdy gamers?  &amp;#x200B;  UPDATE: Alright, thanks everyone for sharing your thoughts! Really appreciate it. To wrap up, here's a summary of the reasons why Nvidia stock isn't continually rising:  * People only trust their own eyes. Which I think is fair. I could sit here forever explaining how the AI revolution will play out and people would still wait until they can actually feel the impact themselves. For example, in the next 4 weeks, ChatGPT will roll out an image creator. A large amount of normies will absolutely love that feature. Normie subs to ChatGPT -&gt; normie loves it -&gt; normie understands Nvidia hardware is driving it -&gt; normie invests -&gt; stock rises. That's the only way it happens. No reddit post can compete with that. * Supply. Nvidia just can not keep up with the orders. The demand is wayyy higher than the supply. And this isn't changing anytime soon. Takes forever to build these factories. * Ursula got wind of the numbers Nvidia is crankin' out and is preparing a 4 billion fine for being smarter than the competition. * Geopolitical uncertainties.   &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-10-08 17:04:42]

They cited the ongoing AI boom as a key driver, expecting strong AI server momentum to surpass projections and continue outpacing supply.

[Nvidia $25B buyback,;,; Is this really a good use of resources? I don't know when the company last sold shares, but I doubt it was at a price higher than it is now. I thought buybacks were done when an issuer thought their stock was undervalued and could purchase it for less than originally sold.  They could instead pay off all their outstanding notes, but considering the low rates on them, they could earn a risk free net return elsewhere.  Doubling their dividend could be an attractive option. They have been paying only .04 a quarter when they use to pay .16.  Companies lately have been choosing stock buyback plans rather than paying dividends or increasing them. While this can lead to a higher share price, it doesn't exactly return profits to investors like a dividend does.   Deciding what to do with excess cash is a difficult decision. Reinvestment helps a company grow. Paying dividends adds value. I just don't really see the benefit of buybacks unless there aren't any better opportunities. Not at these prices anyway.

[Exclusive: Nvidia pursues $30 billion custom chip opportunity with new unit -sources,;,; https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-chases-30-billion-custom-chip-market-with-new-unit-sources-2024-02-09/       SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for cloud computing firms and others, including advanced artificial intelligence (AI) processors, nine sources familiar with its plans told Reuters.  The dominant global designer and supplier of AI chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market for custom AI chips and shield itself from the growing number of companies pursuing alternatives to its products.  The Santa Clara, California-based company controls about 80% of high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock market value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023.  Nvidia's customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT.O), opens new tab, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab and Meta Platforms (META.O), opens new tab, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of its chips to compete in the fast-emerging generative AI sector.  Its H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time to design.  Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to rival firms such as Broadcom (AVGO.O), opens new tab and Marvell Technology (MRVL.O), opens new tab, said the sources, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  "If you're really trying to optimize on things like power, or optimize on cost for your application, you can't afford to go drop an H100 or A100 in there," Greg Reichow, general partner at venture capital firm Eclipse Ventures said in an interview. "You want to have the exact right mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need."  Nvidia does not disclose H100 prices, which are higher than for the prior-generation A100, but each chip can sell for $16,000 to $100,000 depending on volume and other factors. Meta plans to bring its total stock to 350,000 H100s this year. Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon.com (AMZN.O), opens new tab, Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for them, two sources familiar with the meetings said. Beyond data center chips, Nvidia has pursued telecom, automotive and video game customers.  Nvidia shares rose 2.75% after the Reuters report, helping lift chip stocks overall. Marvell shares dropped 2.78%.  In 2022, Nvidia said it would let third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking technology with their own chips. It has said nothing about the program since, and Reuters is reporting its wider ambitions for the first time. A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company's 2022 announcement.  Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), opens new tab and Marvell executive, heads Nvidia's custom unit and her team's goal is to make its technology available for customers in cloud, 5G wireless, video games and automotives, a LinkedIn profile said. Those mentions were scrubbed and her title changed after Reuters sought comment from Nvidia.  Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment.     **$30 BILLION MARKET**  According to estimates from research firm 650 Group‚Äôs Alan Weckel, the data center custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year, and double that in 2025.  The broader custom chip market was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023, which amounts to roughly 5% of annual global chip sales, according to Needham analyst Charles Shi.  Currently, custom silicon design for data centers is dominated by Broadcom and Marvell.  In a typical arrangement, a design partner such as Nvidia would offer intellectual property and technology, but leave the chip fabrication, packaging and additional steps to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330.TW), opens new tab or another contract chip manufacturer.  Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales.  "With Broadcom's custom silicon business touching $10 billion, and Marvell‚Äôs around $2 billion, this is a real threat," said Dylan Patel, founder of silicon research group SemiAnalysis. "It's a real big negative - there's more competition entering the fray."  **BEYOND AI**  Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson (ERICb.ST), opens new tab for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics processing unit (GPU) technology, two sources familiar with the discussions said. Ericsson declined to comment.  650 Group's Weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year. Nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video game markets, according to sources and public social media postings.  Weckel expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6 billion to $8 billion range at 20% a year, and the $7 billion to $8 billion video game custom chip market could increase with the next-generation consoles from Xbox and Sony (6857.T), opens new tab.  Nintendo's current Switch handheld console already includes Nvidia's Tegra X1 chip. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is likely to include a Nvidia custom design, one source said.  Nintendo declined to comment.,;,; 2024-02-09 23:15:02]
[Why is Nvidia so cheap?,;,; Nvidia's valuation based on forward earnings is cheaper than it's ever been since it's data centre business took off. Why is this? Do investors not believe it can continue growing after it's already grown so much? This sounds a lot like what people were saying when Apple hit $1T and look how that turned out.  Do you think NVDA is a smart long term buy. Will their software services lock people into their "ecosystem" to make up for GPU sales that will eventually slow?,;,; 2023-12-16 10:04:44]

[Cathie Wood's ARK Invest sold most of its Nvidia stake just before the chipmaker kicked off a rally that added $585 billion in market value,;,; Cathie Wood's Ark Invest is probably wishing it didn't sell nearly 1 million shares of Nvidia between early October and today following the chipmaker's massive year-to-date surge of more than 160%.  Nvidia stock soared as much as 30% on Thursday after the company announced jaw-dropping guidance as it benefits from a wave of demand for its chipsets that support generative AI technology platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Alphabet's Bard.  But the active investment manager, who has owned Nvidia on and off since the flagship fund's inception in 2014, missed out on massive gains as it started to pare down its position in Nvidia heading into a 52-week low in mid-October.  Since Ark Invest's first sale on October 5, when it held 1.3 million shares of Nvidia across all of its ETFs, the stock has soared 190% and added $620 billion to its market value. By late November, Nvidia owned just over 500,000 shares of the company.  Today, Ark Invest holds just 390,000 shares across its suite of next-generation technology ETFs. The stock is not in its flagship Disruptive Innovation fund.  Rough calculations by Insider suggest Ark Invest left more than $200 million in potential profits on the table when it sold down its Nvidia stake throughout the end of last year.   Ark's ill-timed share sale of Nvidia highlights the difficulties of actively managing a portfolio of disruption-focused investments, because even if you pick the right theme to invest in, there's no guarantee you'll pick the right companies to bet on.  **In February, Wood said Ark's wave of Nvidia sales was in part because its valuation was "very high" and that it was consolidating its portfolio into higher conviction names.**  "We like Nvidia, we think it's going to be a good stock. It's priced, it's the 'check-the-box' AI company. For a flagship fund, where we're consolidated towards our highest conviction names, part of that has to do with the valuation," she told CNBC on February 27.  Wood is instead counting on UiPath for Ark Invest's exposure to artificial intelligence, which is its second largest position across all of its ETFs. Meanwhile, Tesla remains Ark Invest's top holding, which is also working on artificial intelligence to help enable its self-driving technology.   But despite the hype in AI this year, those two stocks have only captured some of the year-to-date gains seen across the space. Shares of UIPath are up just 14% year-to-date, while Tesla stock is up an impressive 50%.   Shares of Ark Invest's Disruptive Innovation ETF were down 2.7% on Thursday, despite the Nasdaq 100 jumping 1.7%.   https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/cathie-wood-ark-invest-sold-nvidia-stake-before-ai-rally-2023-5?,;,; 2023-05-25 23:55:45]
[Nvidia ($NVDA) is the best risk-reward short over the next few months,;,; On a technical-level, $NVDA is absolutely ridiculous. It's valuation is on-par with it's 2021 peak when the GPU shortage was at it's peak, and it's up almost 100% YTD with its inventories ballooning. Of course, trying to short a company just because it's over-valued or overbought is a fool's errand. You'll quickly find out that great stocks can simply keep going up for months on end. That's why you need a spark, or a narrative shift to get the ball rolling for the stock to reverse.  https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-says-its-ai-supercomputer-is-faster-greener-than-nvidia-2023-04-05/  Fundamentally, $NVDA's enormous bounce has been attributed to Chat GPT and the recent AI movement. Just to be clear, I'm bullish on AI. (not $AI lol) However, up until now $NVDA's narrative has been that they will be the biggest, if not the sole, chip benefactor of the AI wave. Their A100 chip is the bread and butter for AI development while their H100 chip is the much beefier, enterprise-focused one. Don't get me wrong, the H100 is quite amazing and it's recent release will be hard to catch for some time. However, up until this point it's been thought that their lead in chips over AMD and Intel would grant them a large revenue boost over the next few years. Google's timely outperformance of the A100 is a testament that challengers are emerging. Nvidia's lead might end sooner than expected.  As we all know, once a technology trend catches on - the big tech players catch on and move quickly while deploying mountains of cash. Whether it's Apple, Microsoft, or Google - they will compete if the TAM is large enough. Whether it's Microsoft squishing out Zoom and Slack, or Apple ousting Intel CPU chips, or Google leveraging YouTube to compete against TikTok - these corporations do not hesitate to compete at any large opportunity.  I think tonight, the narrative has shifted for AI chips. I think we can all agree that big tech truly understands the dramatic paradigm shift that this AI wave will be. AI has been on the backburner for years up until Chat GPT recently proved that it's coming now. Therefore, would it be surprising that these corporations will try to develop their AI-chips in-house? Apple did it for their CPUs in their macs, thanks to TSMC. If Nvidia controlled and manufactured its own fabs then this discussion would be irrelevant. But that's not the case. Google has apparently already caught up to the A100 with their chip designs. What about Apple or Microsoft? You think they're content with continuing to dump fortunes on Nvidia chips if AI is the future? Of course they're going to develop their own chips in house as well. Hardware is key. That's been a turning point for Meta, and is a large reason they're trying to make VR work. You need to control both the hardware and the software.  tl;dr: OTM Puts on $NVDA for May or June 2023. Expect a 20-30% drop in the coming weeks.,;,; 2023-04-05 03:23:15]
[Nvidia looks cheap to me now,;,; With a P/E of 63.08, Nvidia hasn't been this cheap for a while now. It seems to me Nvidia is setting up for a nice rally as the earnings were strong as ever.

I am wondering what you guys think.,;,; 2023-11-26 18:38:15]
[Can you go wrong with NVIDIA and AMD?,;,; They‚Äôre the two biggest companies in a triopoly formed by them and Qualcomm.

AMD just bought a AI software company(Mipsology) and NVIDIA did as well with OmniML. They‚Äôre shaping up to be two of the biggest players in an industry that is going to 10x in the next 7 years.

[Nvidia stock pops on HSBC upgrade: 'We're shocked by Nvidia's pricing power on AI',;,; &gt;HSBC Head of Technology Frank Lee wrote in a note that he had concerns over Nvidia's declining data center revenue through the last two quarters as well as its rising inventories. But he believes the pricing of A.I. chips counteracts those headwinds and changes the revenue model for Nvidia.   &gt;   &gt;"In particular, we‚Äôre shocked by Nvidia‚Äôs pricing power on AI chips that we see driving earnings upside, higher valuation," Lee wrote.

[Ultimate Nvidia DD (The Best),;,; First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens.        It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark.    No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space.        First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently?        You could say it‚Äôs because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood.    It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT.        AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks.        How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype?    Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it‚Äôs not just any Product. It‚Äôs a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.    An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.        This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).        This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.        They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.        How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else.        Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:        \- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees        \- Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)        \- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)        \- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers        The Analogy:        ‚ÄûPrivate customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).        TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.        The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.        At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.        Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.        Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.        What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.        Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.‚Äú        \----        NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.        Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that‚Äôs their moat. This tells me that the person doesn‚Äôt know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.        NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They ‚Äûonly‚Äú design them.        Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It‚Äôs TSMC.    TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.        So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big ‚ÄûChip Design Company‚Äú. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult ‚Äúmoat‚Äù part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.        There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.        So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.    Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?    This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.        Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.        AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.        Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they‚Äôre building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.        According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.        Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!        Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:        ‚ÄûHowever, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple‚Äôs GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.        Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple‚Äôs commitment to developing its own graphics technology.‚Äú (Does Apple use Nvidia?

[PSA: Do you beat yourself up after missing 'obvious' opportunities like Nvidia and AI? It's not just you, and it's called Hindsight Bias.,;,; Before I knew about this psychological bias, I (and many others I know) thought we just had trouble 'biting the bullet' and investing in solid ideas. Thoughts like "it was in front of me all along, but for some reason, I was too scared to put money into it" were common. But the fact of the matter is, there are thousands of 'ideas' at any given moment, and the ones that actually make the news and become multi-baggers were **not** obvious in the past. So why do people feel this way, that they keep 'missing' out on obviously great investments? This is what is known as Hindsight Bias.   Hindsight bias is, [according to Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hindsight-bias.asp), "a psychological phenomenon that allows people to convince themselves after an event that they accurately predicted it before it happened. This can lead people to conclude that they can accurately predict other events. Hindsight bias is studied in behavioral economics because it is a common failing of individual investors."  Why is knowing about hindsight bias significant? One, because if you believe that you **did** have proper insight and analytical skills to spot future success stories, then you might chase after any idea that looks good to to you **now**. However, unless you actually have proof that you were able to consistency find good ideas in that past that you simply didn't capitalize on, then you should not trust just your memory. Otherwise, one would pick potentially bad investments, and then **think** that they knew about other better ideas, repeating the cycle.   It's also important to recognize this bias just for your state of mind. Enough people feel bad enough about missing multi-baggers like Amazon when they should be giving themselves a break. Saying you could have made made 100k if you only invested in some stock years ago is not the same as losing 100k, or we'd all be in the hole. So don't fret about the past and keep looking to the future. There are still plenty of opportunities out there, so best of luck investing!   **Tldr:** Whatever happened in the past was not obvious, no matter how much it feels like it. Don't be overconfident that you can catch future ones but don't beat yourself up over missing opportunities either. Focus on the future!,;,; 2023-06-01 23:17:42]

[Nvidia and The Coming Darkness,;,; Nvidia and The Coming Darkness          In a more serious sector of the market, we have $NVDA making a historic move to a new ATH ($380) on the speculation of transformative AI breakthroughs. Recession fears lying dead in the trunk of the starship rocket. With the price of used GPU‚Äôs sliding to the downside since early 2022, it‚Äôs hard to understand where the priced in demand will come into fruition.     Last quarter, Nvidia‚Äôs profit surged 26% to $2 billion, and sales rose 19% to $7.2 billion, each easily surpassing Wall Street analysts‚Äô forecasts. Nvidia‚Äôs outlook for the current quarter was also significantly ‚Äî about 50% ‚Äî higher than analysts‚Äô predictions.    The pump is based on forward earnings estimates along side the speculation on new AI tech. Let‚Äôs break down these two individually and see if this historic move is justified.    Let‚Äôs begin with Generative AI as this is the premise for massive forward anticipated demand. So powerful and transformative it will transcend and eclipse the likely incoming recession.    Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. The recent buzz around generative AI has been driven by the simplicity of new user interfaces for creating high-quality text, graphics and videos in a matter of seconds.         Going forward, this technology could help write code, design new drugs, develop products, redesign business processes and transform supply chains.    What are use cases for generative AI?    ‚Ä¢	Implementing chatbots for customer service and technical support.    ‚Ä¢	Deploying deepfakes for mimicking people or even specific individuals.    ‚Ä¢	Improving dubbing for movies and educational content in different languages.    ‚Ä¢	Writing email responses, dating profiles, resumes and term papers.    ‚Ä¢	Creating photorealistic art in a particular style.    ‚Ä¢	Improving product demonstration videos.    ‚Ä¢	Suggesting new drug compounds to test.    ‚Ä¢	Designing physical products and buildings.    ‚Ä¢	Optimizing new chip designs.    ‚Ä¢	Writing music in a specific style or tone.        These seem like great conveniences for the modern world. Transformative recession resistant groundbreaking technology? Not so much. AMD has shared a small fraction of the liquidity wave incoming for AI tech. They over expanded their business ventures in late 2021 as we slid into a major market pullback based on inflation fears and fed tightening. Is this a leading indicator of what‚Äôs to come for NVIDIA‚Äôs aggressive expansion moving into a recession yet to be priced in? Maybe.     NVIDIA has the technicals, financials and narrative on its side. All of which can change on a dime. What really matters are valuations which are flashing red in an alarming way.    The new all-time high price wasn‚Äôt the only new ATH for NVIDIA.    Let‚Äôs look at some indicators for NVIDIA.       Price to earnings P/E (TTM)    ‚Ä¢	NEW ATH ‚Äì 218x (2023)    ‚Ä¢	OLD ATH ‚Äì 97x (2017)      We‚Äôve seen a significant rise in the P/E ratio in a very short period, which indicates a large amount of speculation on NVIDIA.       Price to Sales P/S (TTM)    ‚Ä¢	NEW ATH ‚Äì 34.8x (2023)    ‚Ä¢	OLD ATH ‚Äì 26.2x (2021)       P/S at 34.8x is extremely high, it‚Äôs also important to note that we‚Äôre at higher levels currently than we were at peak mania back in both 2021 &amp; 2017. You will be dead before earnings catch up with current valuations, your children would also likely expire prior to these valuations making sense. We could call this a multi-generational investment strategy at best. Jokes aside, it‚Äôs more likely than not that we will see a massive correction in NVIDIA stock price. Insider sell volume continues to grow over the last 3 quarters and is likely to continue throughout 2023 and into 2024.    Nvidia is not a small startup. Its sales amounted to $27bn over the past year, while its free cash flow came in at $3.8bn, reflecting a free cash flow margin of 14%, which is higher than the NDX average of 12%. Such extreme valuation ratios are rare for large established companies as growth is a declining function of market size.      The combination of speculative trading activity, particularly in options markets, and the allure of a new game-changing technology often come together to create spikes in stock prices that are far out of line with any fundamental developments. As a stock's price rises, its gain attracts attention and strengthens the credibility of the underlying bullish story, which creates further buying interest. When a high volume of option trading takes place as in the case of Nvidia currently, this adds fuel to the fire as relatively small amounts of individual capital can have an outsized impact on prices.    We often see investors abandon traditional valuation methods or ignore valuations altogether when a fashionable stock such as Nvidia rallies significantly beyond its earnings potential. Many recent articles on Nvidia do a good job of explaining why the company will grow strongly yet ignore the issue of valuation.      As much as I enjoy my NVIDIA GPU, AMD has bridged the gap in performance at a cheaper price. NVIDIA are well known for being overpriced in the gaming industry. Future growth at this valuation almost completely relies on AI rapidly improving to another level again from here. This is screaming sell the news IMO. Given everything we‚Äôve gone over and the coming recession, NVIDIA cannot possibly keep up with their projections in the most recent report. If you don‚Äôt believe the recession is coming, just remember a 3-month and 10-year inversion has never been wrong.    It is very easy to see the flaws investing in something like $PEPE or $GME. NVIDIA on the other hand is a good company and does a great job of projecting believable future growth.       Beware the Phantom.,;,; 2023-05-26 00:52:37]
[Nvidia - growth in the future?,;,; Nvidia has had a tough year. The gaming side is in a state of financial recovery due to a resurgence of interest in GPUs in computer games and also the data centre is expanding thanks to increased use cases outside of ChatGPT.   Prices increased because of Nvidia‚Äôs bigger role as the biggest supplier of A100 chips in this market.  The auto industry is doing very well and Nvidia‚Äôs stock price would benefit immensely from a lucrative partnership with Mercedes ([https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/02/23/mercedes-benz-digitalization/](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/02/23/mercedes-benz-digitalization/)). The company is one of the three major players in the semiconductor industry; a partnership with Mercedes would be a huge revenue generator.

First gen GPUs (ARC) competitive with last gen Nvidia/AMD, next gen will likely be better with driver updates   4. They finally brought back a REAL engineer, Pat Gangsta Gelsinger, to lead the company.    5. Nvidia already testing out Intel's fabs for making their next gen chips   6. They have the US government funding their fab construction   7. If/when Taiwan gets invaded, TSMC will fall under Chinese control and Intel be the only western company that can make AI chips.

[How Competitive will AMD be against Nvidia in AI Accelerator Market,;,; I've been delving into the specifics of AMD's New MI 300 platform and it appears to stack up favorably against the H100, often surpassing it in several aspects. However, there's an ongoing discussion about ROCm lagging behind CUDA, though AMD is vigorously working to bridge this software gap. Despite not being a semiconductor novice, I find myself drawn to AMD's chiplet-based design over Nvidia's monolithic approach. As we move toward smaller die sizes with High NA EUV, expertise in chiplet-based design will prove crucial, yielding numerous advantages. Additionally, AMD's ability to integrate different process nodes within the same package adds to cost efficiency.        This discussion is pertinent due to the striking disparity in revenue estimates between AMD and Nvidia. The projections suggest Nvidia might achieve over six times the Accelerator revenue in 2027. It's worth noting that the actual figure could be even higher, considering that Data Center revenue encompasses enterprise CPU sales as well. Does anyone have any thoughts?,;,; 2023-09-19 15:52:11]
[Breaking: Nvidia‚Äôs Market Volatility Exposed as Graphics Card Price Drops Signal Intense Competition in Semiconductor Industry.,;,; Graphics card prices in the semiconductor industry have been on the decline for almost a year, and Nvidia, one of the leading players in the semiconductor industry, has felt the impact. The company‚Äôs RTX 4060 and RTX 4080 models have experienced price drops. This development serves as a reminder that even industry giants like Nvidia face intense competition in the semiconductor market, making investments in the company potentially volatile.  Today Forbes reported a significant decrease in the prices of Nvidia‚Äôs RTX 4060, with the card dropping by as much as six percent within just a week of its launch.   Include the tepid reception from reviewers, and this isn‚Äôt a good start for Nvidia‚Äôs latest launch. This has resulted in customers gravitating towards older graphics cards from both AMD and Nvidia themselves, particularly those not heavily reliant on ray tracing or DLSS technologies.  The situation becomes more apparent with the RTX 4080, as the graphics card‚Äôs experienced a price drop in Europe, and a 17 percent reduction in the US market from $1,199 to $999 was the most significant change.   These price drops and market dynamics highlight the highly competitive nature of the semiconductor industry. Nvidia‚Äôs position as a dominant player does not shield it from the pressures of a rapidly evolving market. The recent pricing pressure also suggests potential challenges in terms of demand and competition, which may impact the company‚Äôs financial performance and stock value.  Investing in Nvidia should be approached with caution, considering the inherent volatility in the semiconductor industry. While Nvidia has demonstrated its ability to adapt and innovate in the past, the market landscape is constantly shifting. The recent price drops serve as a stark reminder that even established players must navigate fierce competition and changing consumer preferences.  It is crucial to keep a watchful eye on Nvidia‚Äôs future product releases, market trends, and financial performance. These factors will shape the company‚Äôs ability to maintain its competitive edge and provide a clearer picture of the investment potential in the semiconductor industry.  In conclusion, Nvidia‚Äôs recent experience with pricing pressure highlights the competitiveness and volatility of the semiconductor market. As the company continues to navigate these challenges, investors should carefully assess the risks and potential rewards associated with investing in this industry heavyweight.,;,; 2023-07-10 12:00:04]

[Risk vs. reward in AI and computing, specifically NVIDIA and Intel?,;,; Not sure if this goes under company or industry discussion because it's about 2 specific companies in the same industry. Sorry if it's flaired wrong.  I'm new to all this, but I'm curious about investing in NVIDIA and Intel. To me it looks like there are both good and bad things about both so I don't know if it's the right time to invest.  NVIDIA has a huge stake in AI, they make some of the best hardware for it, and AI's huge right now, plus there are leaks (from sources which have previously proven accurate) of a new gaming/creator GPU for the high-end desktop market (a potential Titan RTX ADA or RTX 4090 Ti), which NVIDIA hasn't had an offering for for a few years. However, it sounds like they have a lot of unsold inventory of gaming GPUs, which is concerning.  I have less info on Intel, but there's recently been discussion of future 1.8- and 2-nanometer process nodes from them, which is really promising. However, their recent high-end CPUs have been widely considered "uncoolable" when overclocked and extremely difficult to cool when run at stock speeds (see the recent Linus Tech Tips video where they cooled an i9-13900k with a 5000W chiller, titled "The God of Computer Coolers." Meanwhile, their gaming GPUs have generally flopped. However, smaller transistors are known to consume less power and generate less heat (although transistor counts will likely massively increase).,;,; 2023-03-18 19:35:01]

[Nvidia‚Äôs stock could fly to $550 amid ‚Äòrobust demand‚Äô across the board in AI, analyst says,;,; Nvidia Corp. is benefiting from ‚Äúrobust demand‚Äù for artificial-intelligence servers across the board, and that could help extend the stock‚Äôs stunning rally, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets.  KeyBanc analyst John Vinh upped his price target on shares of Nvidia NVDA, -0.76% to $550 from $500 late Monday, with his new target among the highest on Wall Street: Above Vinh‚Äôs $550 target were one $767 target price and two $600 target prices, according to FactSet. C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI matched Vinh at $550.  Shares closed Monday at $421.80, and they‚Äôre up 189% so far this year.  Vinh‚Äôs heightened optimism about Nvidia‚Äôs prospects comes after he conducted channel checks in Asia. Those indicated strong interest in AI servers that are ‚Äúnot only coming from cloud but also enterprise and from AI startups,‚Äù he wrote in a note to clients.  Additionally, he said he sees the potential for Nvidia to benefit from delays related to an Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, +0.36% product.  ‚ÄúDelays associated with AMD‚Äôs MI300 are likely to free up incremental capacity in 2H23, while we believe NVDA has secured enough capacity (CoWoS) to quadruple its datacenter revenues in 2024,‚Äù Vinh wrote, referring to chip-on-wafer-on-substrate, a type of packaging.   That said, Vinh also boosted his price target on shares of AMD, despite more ‚Äúmixed‚Äù channel checks there, compared with the ‚Äúpositive‚Äù ones for Nvidia.  ‚ÄúWhile near-term challenges associated with delays of its MI300 AI server and stability issues with its PC NB Ryzen Phoenix (7040) could result in near-term risk to estimates, AI server wins at HP/El Capitan, MSFT, and Meta give us high conviction that AMD could see well over $2B in AI revenues in 2024,‚Äù Vinh wrote, as he lifted his price target on the shares to $160 from $150.  Chip companies will begin reporting earnings in the coming weeks, and one trend to watch will be how server demand is playing out more broadly. ‚ÄúAI servers [are] seeing outsized demand but appear to be cannibalizing traditional server,‚Äù Vihn wrote in his note to clients.

[NVIDIA's Impressive Report: Not the Market's Silver Bullet,;,; What's driving today's markets?  As anticipated, Wall Street's opening was a mixed bag, echoing the fluctuating futures. Shares in the real sector and banks are down, whereas technology and semiconductor manufacturers' stocks are enjoying a healthy boost. The primary catalyst for this tech growth was Nvidia's earnings report, released after yesterday's market close.  What's happening with NVIDIA?  Despite a decline in revenue and net profit by 13% and 20% respectively, the reported figures significantly outpaced analysts' predictions. Furthermore, the company announced impressive sales for Q2 2023 that surprised even the most bullish investors. Pre-market NVIDIA shares surged by 24%, and since the opening bell, the growth has topped 25%. A little more momentum, and Nvidia will join the $1 trillion club.  In my view, this is a fascinating story that highlights the 135% increase in NVIDIA's share price over the past year, which ha largely been attributed to the booming popularity of AI.  However, **I believe this growth alone won't suffice to propel the market further**. Given the challenging economic conditions, I see a high probability of a market correction on the horizon.  Let's also consider some statistical data. U.S. GDP figures surpassed expectations, yet with the unresolved debt ceiling issue, this news has taken a back seat and will likely resonate later. And as for the initial U.S. jobless claims? No change there either, meaning there‚Äôs yet more to keep an eye on in the future.  What raises concern is that the **DXY is standing at 104.21 points**, and the **ten-year UST yield is at 3.77% per annum**, with **the two-year yield at an alarming 4.42%**! Meanwhile, **gold is trending downwards**. All in all, quite an intriguing scenario.,;,; 2023-05-25 14:50:50]

If for example TSMC's Arizona facilities are completed in 2027, somehow allowing 10x orders to go to NVidia, NVidia will increase substantially if they're paid upon shipment. If they're paid months, and in some cases a year in advance, their increase may be limited if they're already being paid for chips that aren't yet finished and ready to assemble. I'm just curious if Nvidia has ever explained if they essentially request payment on delivery, or upon the time of agreement of purchase.   Thanks in advance.,;,; 2024-01-24 17:27:32]
[Ways to estimate how ServiceNow and NVIDIA Partnership Impact ServiceNow's Bottom Line and share price?,;,; Hello r/Stocks,I've been trying to understand how to capitalize on the ongoing AI boom. I've been looking into ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), which recently announced a partnership with NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA).     In articles from May 17, 2023, NVDA mentioned their plan to develop enterprise-grade generative AI capabilities to enhance business processes with faster, smarter workflow automation with NOW. NVDA's technology and infrastructure will be key to developing these custom large language models specifically for NOW platform.     ServiceNow already has some AI features, but this new partnership could introduce more uses for generative AI across the enterprise. It sounds like this could make a big difference to IT departments, customer service teams, employees, and developers by strengthening workflow automation and quickly increasing productivity.     It also seems like NOW will be using this new AI tech to help NVIDIA improve its own IT operations.They're working on various applications of generative AI to improve productivity. For example, they're developing intelligent virtual assistants and agents for handling user queries and support requests, as well as tools for customer service agents for automatic issue resolution and knowledge-base article generation.     On NVIDIA's end, they're providing AI Foundations cloud services and the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, which includes the NVIDIA NeMo framework. It looks like these tools will help developers build, customize, and deploy language models for different enterprise use cases.     How do you think this partnership could impact NOW' bottom line?

Microsoft (at least right now) is also the most logically and fairly valued P/E wise (unlike say, Nvidia's astronomical PE) and I may dabble with a few grand bc it's cheap.   They also have good cash on hand and good EPS.    Not sure what to make of Apple or PLTR in the AI game, with PLTR some people say their products are the best and most proprietary and others are just "meh" on PLTR and say they are super overvalued.    So who do you guys think will come out on top in the next few years in the AI arena? ,;,; 2023-09-05 23:48:37]
[Britain blocks Microsoft‚Äôs $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard,;,; LONDON ‚Äî Britain‚Äôs top competition regulator on Wednesday moved to block[ Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)‚Äôs acquisition of video game publisher [Activision Blizzard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ATVI/).  The  measure marks a major blow for the U.S. tech giant, as it seeks to  convince authorities that the deal will benefit competition.  Microsoft said it plans to appeal the decision.  The  U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said that it opposed the deal as  it raises competition concerns in the nascent cloud gaming market.  Microsoft  could make Activision‚Äôs games exclusive to its cloud gaming platform,  Xbox Game Pass, cuting off distribution to other key players in the  space, the CMA said.  Cloud gaming is a technology that enables  gamers to access games via companies‚Äô remote servers ‚Äî effectively  streaming a game like you would a movie on Netflix. The technology is  still in its infancy, but Microsoft is betting big on it becoming a  mainstream way of playing games.  Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in January 2022 for $69 billion, in [one of the biggest deals the video game industry has seen](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-buy-activision.html) to date.  Executives  at the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant believe the  acquisition will boost its efforts in gaming by adding lucrative  franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga to its content  offerings.  However, some of Microsoft‚Äôs competitors contested the  deal, concerned it may give Microsoft a tight grip on the $200 billion  games market. Of particular concern was the prospect that Microsoft [may shut off distribution access to Activision‚Äôs popular Call of Duty franchise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/09/16/microsoft-is-growing-tired-of-sonys-call-of-duty-complaints/?sh=bd568595ebb9) for certain platforms.  [Sony](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/6758.T-JP/), in particular, has voiced concern with Microsoft‚Äôs Activision purchase.  The Japanese gaming giant fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty  exclusive to its Xbox consoles in the long run.    Microsoft sought to allay those concerns by offering Sony, [Nintendo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7974.T-JP/), [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)  and other firms [10-year agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/microsoft-says-it-will-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-for-10-years.html) to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms.  Microsoft  argues it wouldn‚Äôt be financially beneficial to withhold Call of Duty  from PlayStation, Nintendo and other rivals given the licensing income  it generates from keeping the game available on their platforms.  Microsoft  President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering  Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo ‚Äî to make Call of Duty  available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same  features. Sony still opposes the deal.  The CMA had raised concerns  with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent  cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which  offers cloud gaming among its perks. Microsoft has committed to bring  new Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass on day one of its release.  Cloud  gaming, or the ability to access games via PC or mobile devices over  the internet, is still in its infancy and requires a strong broadband  connection to work well. According to network intelligence firm  Sandvine, cloud gaming made up less than 1% of global internet traffic  in 2022.

[Intel foundry event/subsidies,;,; I know intel is not a fan favorite on reddit, but with the 10 billion in subsidies reported after market close and the interesting industry leaders/government officials added as speakers at the foundry event I am expecting at least a couple surprises to be announced. The fireside chat with Sam Altman seems like it could be very interesting given the rumors of him  looking for partners in building chips to rival nvidias products. It may not happen right away but I wouldn't be surprised if the government is highly suggesting to him what foundries to work with in order to get his foreign funding approved. This is a national security risk after all. What are your expectations for the foundry event?

[Intel stock sinks as early 2024 outlook comes up short,;,; [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/intel-intc-earnings-report-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/intel-intc-earnings-report-q4-2023.html)  Intel  shares dropped in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker issued an outlook for the first quarter of 2024 that lagged analyst forecasts even as results for the latest quarter beat Wall Street estimates.        Here‚Äôs how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December:        Earnings per share: 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected    Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.15 billion expected      For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue.        Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year.        With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue.        Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia  and AMD  on Wall Street.        Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia‚Äôs recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs.        Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company  in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips.        Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye  into an independent company in 2022.        Intel‚Äôs largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%.        Intel‚Äôs second largest division, Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 10% to $4 billion. That unit includes server CPUs and GPUs.        Intel foundry services, its business making chips for other companies, remains nascent, with $291 million in revenue, a 63% annual increase.,;,; 2024-01-25 21:17:40]
[Apple stock closes at an all-time-high, added $1 trillion to its market cap in 2023,;,; Apple (AAPL) achieved a new record high yesterday, closing at $197.96, up 1.67% for the day.         The company consistently outperforms its peers and is one of only five US companies valued at over $1 trillion. Notably, on December 6, 2023, Apple surpassed a $3 trillion total market valuation.         Throughout 2023, Apple increased its market cap by $1 trillion, reaching a total valuation of $4 trillion expected in 2024 if the pace continues.         Other companies with over $1 trillion valuations include Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia. The gap between Apple and Microsoft is around $220 billion.         While these figures are interesting to observe, they don't mean much unless you're a stockholder. Apple's market cap is likely to reach $4 trillion in 2024 if its pace doesn't slow down, and with Apple Vision Pro on the horizon, anything is possible    ,;,; 2023-12-14 11:35:56]

[Congressional Insider Trading in 2022: Using Inside Knowledge to Make Profits,;,; Throughout 2022, there were a number of instances of very well timed trades among members of Congress. Let's examine a few examples.  In February, Marjorie Taylor Greene, a House Republican, bought stocks in Lockheed Martin, Chevron, and NextEra Energy. Mere days later, the Ukraine conflict escalated. Other politicians followed suit, buying up oil and defense stocks before the Ukraine invasion.  In July, Nancy and Paul Pelosi sold all their Nvidia stock. By August, Nvidia was instructed by the US to limit chip sales in China and Russia, causing the stock to drop 20%. When questioned about the timing of her sale, Pelosi remained silent.  Senator Thomas Carper bought bearish ETFs before significant rate hikes and CPI data from the federal reserve. Interestingly, he sits on the Senate Finance Committee, and his positions have profited.  Congress members also heavily invested in semiconductors prior to the passing of the CHIPS bill and restrictions in China. This led to significant gains for them in 2023.  Dan Crenshaw was questioned about his stock trades, including a sale in February that brought him a 32% return. In response, he implied that trading was a way for Congress members to better themselves.  In 2022, both Pat Fallon and Tom Suozzi faced STOCK Act violations for late disclosures of trades worth hundreds of thousands, but the House Ethics Committee dismissed their cases, citing lack of clear evidence of intentional non-disclosure. Both Fallon and Suozzi continued to make late disclosures of trades throughout the year.  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-07-05 14:36:19]

Siegel is optimistic about quality growth stocks, such as Google, Nvidia, Tesla, and Amazon, regaining prominence.        Additionally, he expects a 4% to 5% rise in housing prices in 2024 due to anticipated interest rate cuts.

Optane - Micron Technology  shut down Joint Venture 3DXPOINT leaving intel without their silicon.  Altera -Intel purchased Altera the #2 fpga player for $17 billion  vastly over paying and seeing no ROI.

At nvidia 200k in rsus would be worth $2.1 million. Why would anyone want to work at intel?   Capex: heavy cap ex requirements will keep pressure on margins  Competition: Intel faces stiff completion from AMD and NVIDIA when it comes to CPU applications. They are also missing out as the large datacenter customers develop their own custom silicon.   GPU - shit show at first when intel rolled out their cards. So many bugs and just terrible performance but looks like driver issues are being addressed an they are already past AMD and closing in on NVIDIA when it comes to their up sampling technology. I'm not very bullish on their GPUs because they had over a decade of experience for iGPU. It remains to be seen if intel GPPU/XPU products will be adopted by the large data center customers.

[Amazon to invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, a rival to ChatGPT developer OpenAI,;,; E-commerce giant Amazon on Monday said it will invest up to $4 billion in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic and take a minority ownership position in the company.The move underscores Amazon‚Äôs aggressive AI push as it looks to keep pace with rivals such as Microsoft and Alphabet‚ÄôsGoogle.  Anthropic was founded roughly two years ago by former OpenAI research executives and recently debuted its new AI chatbot called Claude 2. Amazon is looking to capitalize on the hype and promise of so-called generative AI, which includes technology like OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, as well as Anthropic‚Äôs Claude chatbots.  The two firms on Monday said that they are forming a strategic collaboration to advance generative AI, with the startup selecting Amazon Web Services as its primary cloud provider. Anthropic said it will provide AWS customers with early access to unique features for model customization and fine-tuning capabilities.  Anthropic will also use custom AWS-designed semiconductors to train the foundational models that underpin its AI applications. Foundation models are large AI programs trained on vast amounts of data so that they can be adapted to solve a wide range of tasks.   This year, chip firm Nvidia is the chip firm that has seen the biggest gains from the generative AI boom. Nvidia‚Äôs key product is a type of semiconductor known as a graphics processing unit, which can be used to train huge AI models. At one point Nvidia‚Äôs stock had rallied more than 200%, as the company smashed through financial forecasts on the rising adoption of AI.  To an extent, Amazon‚Äôs deal with Anthropic aims to show that there are alternative chips that can be used for AI applications. AWS customers will be able to build on Anthropic‚Äôs AI models via Amazon Bedrock ‚Äî a service that lets customers build generative AI applications in the cloud via existing models, rather than train their own models.  Amazon is looking to position itself as the one-stop shop for AI. The e-commerce giant designs its own chips for training huge AI models. Through Amazon Bedrock customers can also design their own generative AI applications using existing models, which are all run on the Amazon cloud. The company sells its own AI applications too.  Anthropic already counts some high-profile backers, including Google and Salesforce Ventures. This support comes as tech giants continue to make massive bets on AI companies, a move sparked by Microsoft‚Äôs multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI in January.  https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/25/amazon-to-invest-up-to-4-billion-in-anthropic-a-rival-to-chatgpt-developer-openai.html,;,; 2023-09-25 09:01:26]
[MercadoLibre seems absurdly undervalued.,;,; My portfolio is up 50% this year.  I have a portfolio that is 100% growth stocks and I‚Äôve taken some time to look at valuations to evaluate if I have companies that seem to be over their skis in terms of valuation.  I‚Äôve been looking at lots of stocks in terms of reverse dfc and it seems to me that MercadoLibre is undervalued by about 50%.  They are still growing sales by more than 30% y/y and are improving their operating margin by increasing take rates and reducing costs.  They turn out outstanding results quarter after quarter and when faced with competitive threats from players such as Amazon and Shopee, they just keep coming out on top.  I have a somewhat focused portfolio of 9 stocks, but with the numbers I‚Äôm seeing, I just really want to put everything into MercadoLibre (not that I have a big portfolio - just around 30k)  Every other growth stock I evaluate seems either overvalued or reasonably valued, taking into account ten years of reasonable growth assumptions.  Take Nvidia for example.  I own Nvidia and based on my reverse DCF, if they can grow FCF by 30% for ten years, the stock is currently fairly valued.  I think they might be able to pull that off, so Nvidia might be worth owning.  But according to the same model, MercadoLibre only needs to grow FCF 11% annually over the next 10 years to justify their current valution.  This just seems like an absurdly low bar for them.  If my model is off, it would be off in the same direction for all the companies im evaluating.  Part of me thinks I should just invest in this one company that has both amazing fundamentals and low valuation.  Another part of me is just saying ‚Äúhell no!  Always stay diversified!‚Äù  It‚Äôs like Cramer vs Munger in my head.  One voice says ‚Äú5 stocks minimum‚Äù. The other says, ‚Äúwhy buy anything but your best idea?‚Äù  Peter Lynch is also in my head.  I live in Mexico and use Mercado Libre‚Äôs services, so it‚Äôs a company I can get behind on a personal level.  I think Lynch would approve.  I‚Äôve just never put all my money into one stock before, but this seems like an insane bargain.    What do you think?

Intel stands out as the week's biggest winner among large-cap tech stocks, surging 13%, driven by robust demand for PCs following better-than-expected profit and sales reports. Mizuho Securities upgraded Intel to a buy rating, citing a renewed focus on the data center business and positive prospects in the customer pipeline.  Next week, the spotlight shifts to semiconductors, with Nvidia set to report results. The stock has surged 22% in three weeks, boasting a year-to-date gain of 237%, outpacing other S&amp;P 500 members. Nvidia's strong performance is attributed to its role in generative artificial intelligence, providing graphics processing units (GPUs) for powerful workloads. Analysts expect revenue growth of over 170% for Q3 and anticipate Nvidia's forecast to suggest close to 200% growth in Q4.  Eric Jackson, founder of EMJ Capital, considers Nvidia his "top large-cap name" and sees the tech market in the early stages of a rebound, linked to the potential end of Federal Reserve rate hikes. The market is sensitive to interest rates, with low costs encouraging risk-taking and higher rates directing investors to safer assets.  Tame U.S. inflation data, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) remaining flat in October, boosts the broader market. The week's large-cap gainers also include Tesla, rising 9.2%, despite CEO Elon Musk's controversial social media post.

[AMD shares fall as first-quarter forecast comes in light,;,; Here‚Äôs how the company did versus LESG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus estimates for the quarter ended in December:  EPS: $0.77 per share, adjusted, versus $0.77 per share expected  Revenue: $6.17 billion, versus $6.12 billion expected   For the first quarter, AMD said it expects about $5.4 billion in sales, plus or minus $300 million, while analysts were looking for revenue of $5.73 billion. AMD added that it expected all of its major businesses, including server and PC chips, to decline sequentially during the quarter.  Net income in the fourth quarter was $667 million, or $0.41 per share, versus $21 million, or $0.01 per share a year ago.  AMD makes graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are needed to train and deploy generative artificial intelligence models. While that market is currently dominated by Nvidia, AMD has said that its new AI chips introduced last year will challenge Nvidia‚Äôs H100 GPUs for some applications, and investors are looking for significant growth in the company‚Äôs data center segment over the next few years.  In October, AMD said it expected $2 billion in server GPU sales in 2024.  But historically, AMD‚Äôs main business has been central processors, or CPUs, for PCs and servers. Compared to AI chips, that part of the semiconductor industry has been flat or shrinking over the past few years, as PC sales have suffered post-pandemic.  Data center, which includes server CPUs and AI chips, rose 38% on an annual basis to $2.28 billion in sales. It‚Äôs now firmly AMD‚Äôs largest business and the company said that much of the increase in revenue was attributable to ‚Äústrong growth‚Äù for sales of its Instinct graphics processors, which are used for AI.  However, AMD‚Äôs overall performance in the business was in line with a $2.29 billion FactSet estimates for the Data Center business.  AMD‚Äôs client group, which is comprised mostly of chips for PCs and laptops, rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.  Sales in AMD‚Äôs gaming segment, which includes ‚Äúsemi-custom‚Äù processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù double-digit percentage in the current quarter.

[Why Buy AMD?,;,; To me, it seems like they‚Äôre never going to beat Nvidia, ever. Ive always looked at the prices of both stocks throughout time, even bought one share when they announced a supposedly competitive AI chip and NVIDIA still crushed them.  Whenever I read articles justifying this stock, the reasons to buy are literally the same reason you should buy Nvidia (they‚Äôll be a player in AI, theyre coming out with a new chip); its literally all the same stuff Nvidia does, so what exactly is the competitive edge?  From personal experience, when I used to build PCs, both company‚Äôs products had the exact same capabilities, but the Nvidia brand just had stronger recognition so I always opted for them.  I just dont see the point ever buying AMD when you could buy Nvidia, both company‚Äôs have been around long enough and if AMD was a true competitor they would have proven so by now.,;,; 2023-06-30 18:10:23]

For those that don‚Äôt know  (like me) TSM is the largest chip foundry in the world. It only produces chips whereas a company like NVDA designs chips. I think what makes TSM different is it just cranks out the chips that its customers design. Please correct me if I am wrong here‚Ä¶.  It has been on a tear for the past six months.

[Which stocks encompass most trends that have a chance at catching up in the near future?,;,; I am talking things like AI, AR, VR, Metaverse (whatever that ends up being)...For example:  \- Microsoft: they kinda own OpenAI, they also own Github, so they have all the source code to feed their AI to become a God like programmer (Copilot with superpowers), and finally they own HoloLens, the AR platform.  \- Nvidia: Their GPUs seem to be powering everything futuristic, would've been a great buy few years back. Is there no other public company competing with Nvidia in the GPU chips supremacy?  \- Unity: Popular game engine that is also widely used to build AR/VR experiences, used by "web3" companies to build their "metaverse" dreams, so I see it as a bit of a crypto play too, and they added AI to the mix to automate game building.

[This AI stock may be a bit overpriced, but I think the hype is right.,;,; **-Nvidia stock is trading at more than 200 times earnings following terrific gains this year.**    **-The acceleration in the chipmaker's growth should help it justify its rich valuation, and its forward P/E ratio suggests that it may not be too overpriced.**   **-Nvidia has impressive upside potential and could turn out to be a solid long-term pick.**     **This high-flying stock could be a buy even after eye-popping gains so far in 2023.**   The craze around artificial intelligence (AI) has sent shares of several companies soaring this year. Nvidia ($NVDA) is one of the foremost examples of this trend -- shares of the semiconductor giant have jumped a whopping 180% so far in 2023.  This terrific rally has made shares of Nvidia very expensive as the stock is now trading at 213 times trailing earnings and 39 times sales. Those multiples are significantly higher than Nvidia's already expensive five-year average P/E of 67 and sales multiple of 18. For some more perspective, the S&amp;P 500 has a price-to-sales ratio of 2.45 and earnings multiple of 19.        So, it is safe to say that Nvidia stock is expensive by quite some margin. However, the forward earnings multiple of 52, based on estimates, suggests that the company's earnings are on track to grow at a rapid pace. Nvidia's forward earnings ratio also suggests that the stock is only a tad overpriced when compared to its five-year average forward earnings multiple of 41.   As a result, it makes sense for investors who are looking to take advantage of the AI boom to consider buying Nvidia even after its red-hot rally. A closer look at the company's prospects will make it clear that it is indeed worth the hype.     **Nvidia AI-driven growth is just getting started**  The impact of AI on Nvidia's financial performance became very clear when the company released its fiscal 2024 first-quarter results last month. While revenue fell 13% year over year during the quarter that ended on April 30, to $7.2 billion, the company is estimating a 64% year-over-year jump in revenue in the current quarter, to $11 billion at the midpoint of its guidance range.  The data center business is the biggest reason Nvidia expects a solid acceleration in growth in the current quarter, as this segment is benefiting strongly from the adoption of generative AI.        On the company's latest conference call with analysts, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said that companies are "racing to deploy" Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) to meet growing AI demand. The demand for Nvidia's graphics cards is so strong that the company is reportedly struggling to keep up. Supply issues have reportedly led to a sharp jump in the prices of Nvidia's AI-capable GPUs, with the company reportedly commanding a premium of as much as 40% in China.        The impressive pricing power that Nvidia is enjoying can be attributed to the semiconductor giant's dominant position in the market for AI chips. New Street Research estimates that Nvidia controls a whopping 95% of the market for GPUs that can be deployed for machine learning in data centers. Meanwhile, HSBC estimates that Nvidia enjoys a 90% share of processors used for generative AI applications.        All this indicates that Nvidia is crushing it in the market for AI chips, and it could win big from the same in the long run as the demand for these chips is set to boom even more. Nvidia looks to be at the beginning of a massive growth curve thanks to AI, which should help the company justify its expensive valuation by helping it sustain outstanding growth in the long run.  &amp;#x200B;  **The stock is built for more upside**   Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia  to sustain momentum over the next five years, which is not surprising given the huge opportunity in AI chips discussed above.  Bank of America global research analyst Vivek Arya projects that the adoption of generative AI services could help Nvidia increase its revenue at an annual pace of 25% through 2027. The company is expected to finish fiscal 2024 (which will end in January 2024) with revenue of of almost $40 billion. Assuming it does clock 25% annual revenue growth through the end of 2027 (which will coincide with its fiscal 2028), its top line could jump to nearly $100 billion at the end of the forecast period.        For comparison, Nvidia delivered $27 billion in revenue in fiscal 2023, suggesting that its revenue could nearly quadruple over a five-year period. The stock sports a five-year average sales multiple of 18. While that's rich, it wouldn't be surprising to see Nvidia maintain a similar multiple after five years given its tremendous AI opportunity.        If it keeps that multiple and has $100 billion sales, it would have a market cap of $1.8 trillion. That would be 80% higher than Nvidia's current market cap.,;,; 2023-06-19 05:46:01]

In October, the company said it added 8.76 million paid memberships in the third quarter, pushing its total to 247 million. Wall Street expects Netflix to have continued that trend in the fourth quarter, with forecasts projecting another 8 million to 9 million paid membership adds, bringing the company to roughly 256 million. Netflix took another step toward building subscribers when it announced earlier Tuesday that it would stream the popular WWE Raw starting next year. The deal is the streaming platform‚Äôs biggest step yet into live entertainment.  Netflix is still navigating its transformation from targeting subscriber growth to focusing on profit, using price hikes, password crackdowns and ad-supported tiers to boost revenue.

[EU approves Microsoft‚Äôs $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, clearing major hurdle,;,; https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/15/microsoft-activision-deal-eu-approves-takeover-of-call-of-duty-maker.html  European Union regulators on Monday approved Microsoft‚Äôs proposed $69 billion acquisition of gaming firm Activision Blizzard, subject to remedies offered by the U.S. tech giant. The European Commission, the EU‚Äôs executive arm, said that Microsoft offered remedies in the nascent area of cloud gaming that have staved off antitrust concerns. These remedies centered on allowing users to stream Activision games they purchase on any cloud streaming platform. Europe‚Äôs green light is a huge win for Microsoft, after the U.K.‚Äôs top competition authority last month blocked the deal. Regulators globally have been probing whether Microsoft‚Äôs acquisition of Activision could distort competition in the console and cloud gaming market. One area regulators questioned is whether Microsoft might take Activision games and keep them exclusively on the U.S. giant‚Äôs own platforms. Activision is behind some of the biggest console and PC games in the world, including the Call of Duty franchise and World of Warcraft.  The EU decision comes after the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority last month blocked the deal over concerns that it would reduce competition in the nascent cloud gaming market. The CMA said that Microsoft would find it commercially beneficial to make Activision‚Äôs key games, such as Call of Duty, exclusive to its own cloud gaming platforms. The CMA nevertheless said the acquisition would not reduce competition in the console market.  Microsoft has faced opposition to the deal from regulators and some of its rivals, including PlayStation games console maker Sony. Microsoft sought to allay the Commission‚Äôs concerns over making Activision games exclusive ahead of the EU decision. Microsoft President Brad Smith met with EU officials in February, after which the tech giant said it would bring Xbox PC games to Nvidia‚Äôs cloud gaming service. The chipmaker had reportedly expressed opposition to the acquisition takeover. Microsoft also signed a 10-year deal with Nintendo to bring Call of Duty to the Japanese gaming giant‚Äôs platforms, if the Activison deal closes.,;,; 2023-05-15 14:39:43]

[Short sellers are betting more than $1 trillion against US stocks after big run,;,; * Total US short interest exceeded $1 trillion as of last Friday, S3 Partners data shows. * The top five shorts are mega-cap tech stocks Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon * That comes after big stock market gains so far this year.  US short interest this month rose to the highest level since April 2022, as investors bet that the current bull run in the stock market is set to falter.  According to data from S3 Partners, the amount spent by short sellers against US stocks hit $1.02 trillion, as of Friday. Those bets came even as they continued to rally earlier this month, costing short sellers $101 billion.  S3 data shows that the top shorts are Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. As of Friday, their collective short interest topped $83 billion.  The bearish sentiment results from skepticism about how much higher stocks can go. So far this year, the S&amp;P 500 is up 13.5%, and the Nasdaq is up 29%.  But since the Federal Reserve last week indicated more rate hikes are on the table this year, stocks have been on a losing streak.  This year, Wall Street has been caught up in the hype over artificial intelligence companies, which saw their valuations skyrocket and have brought more investors into the market due to "fear of missing out."  But big names have voiced divided outlooks on the AI frenzy. For instance, while Stanley Druckenmiller sees Nvidia as a stock worth holding for the next couple of years, short seller Jim Chanos has demonstrated skepticism towards the stock.  Meanwhile, the prospect of continued hawkishness from the Fed has added to macroeconomic risks. A recent Goldman Sachs report put the odds of a recession in the next 12 months at 25% and warned a downturn could cause a 23% decline in the S&amp;P 500.

TSMC also claims it is on track for its own 2 nm process node in 2025 and already enjoys the patronage of major customers including Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, MediaTek along with Apple. Undoubtedly, Intel will be keen to secure at least one of these companies as it helps with its own economies of scale as investing in each of these new process nodes is a multi-billion-dollar endeavor.

While risks remain within the plan, IDM 2.0 creates a unique value proposition for potential clients. First, Intel‚Äôs current node roadmap is technologically superior to its main competitor, TSMC. Furthermore, Intel will have a geographic monopoly on advanced semiconductor nodes. TSMC‚Äôs announced expansions in the United States will no longer be generations behind Intel‚Äôs at the estimated time of release.  As a result of these factors, Intel trades at a discount to its Intrinsic value. The market and intrinsic value gap exists due to poor short-term business performance and execution risk.,;,; 2023-09-17 13:22:55]
[Q2 Earnings - Microsoft beats estimates as Azure grows faster than expected,;,; Here‚Äôs how the company performed, compared with consensus among analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:  Earnings: $2.93 per share, vs. $2.78 per share expected  Revenue: $62.02 billion, vs. $61.12 billion expected  Microsoft‚Äôs revenue increased 17.6% year over year in the year, which ended on Dec. 31, according to a statement. Net income, at $21.87 billion, or $2.93 per share, increased from $16.43 billion, or $2.20 per share.  The company‚Äôs Intelligent Cloud segment produced $25.88 billion in revenue, up 20% and above the $25.29 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The grouping contains Azure cloud infrastructure, SQL Server, Windows Server, Nuance, GitHub and enterprise services.  Within that segment, revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 30%. Analysts polled by CNBC had expected 27.7% growth, and the StreetAccount consensus was 27.5%. The metric for the previous quarter was 29%.  Revenue from the Productivity and Business Processes unit including Office productivity software, LinkedIn and Dynamics totaled $19.25 billion. That was up 13% and higher than the $18.99 billion StreetAccount consensus.  The More Personal Computing segment contributed $16.89 billion in revenue, up about 19% and more than the StreetAccount consensus of $16.79 billion. The segment comprises Windows, Surface, Bing and Xbox.  During the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft closed its acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, its largest deal ever. The company also announced custom cloud chips and started selling a $30 monthly Copilot artificial intelligence add-on to Microsoft 365 productivity software bundles.  But layoffs continued. Microsoft‚Äôs LinkedIn subsidiary cut around 700 jobs in October on top of the 10,000 announced earlier in the year.

[Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..),;,; From https://www.investors.com/news/nasdaq-100-plans-special-rebalance-to-curb-dominance-of-magnificent-seven/    The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the "magnificent seven" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.  The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.  The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to "address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights."  The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.  The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.   How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted? The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.  The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.  The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.  Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.  Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.  Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.  Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.  Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.  How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut? Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.  Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.  The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.  Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023 The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.  This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.  There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.  Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices? The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.  However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&amp;P 500, which is why S&amp;P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.  The S&amp;P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.  Most of the "magnificent 7" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.  The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.  Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.,;,; 2023-07-10 20:25:37]

[Disney beats earnings estimates, hikes guidance as it slashes streaming losses,;,; LOS ANGELES ‚Äî The Walt Disney Company reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, as the media giant slashed costs while revenue stagnated.   The company hiked its guidance, and now expects fiscal 2024 earnings per share of about $4.60, which would be at least 20% higher than 2023.   Disney said it is on pace to meet or exceed its goal of cutting costs by at least $7.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2024.   Here is what Disney reported compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:  Earnings per share: $1.22 vs. 99 cents expected  Revenue:$23.55 billion vs. $23.64 billion expected   Disney‚Äôs direct-to-consumer unit reported a $138 million operating loss in the quarter. Including the performance at ESPN+, losses for all its streaming businesses narrowed to $216 million, from $1.05 billion in the prior-year period.  Disney+ core subscribers shrank by 1.3 million from the prior quarter due to price increases, but the company saw a rise in average revenue per user because of those subscription cost hikes.  The company posted the improvements to its streaming business a day after it announced Tuesday that it will launch a new sports streaming venture among ESPN, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery later this year.   While no price has been determined, a logical starting point could be $45 or $50 per month with introductory pricing lower to entice signups, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions around the service have been private.  Disney‚Äôs earning results come as its board battles again with activist investor Nelson Peltz and Blackwells Capital.  While Peltz ended a previous proxy battle against Disney a year ago after the company committed to numerous cost-cutting initiatives, he revived his fight last fall, looking to shake up the board and earn himself and former Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo a seat.  Peltz has cited the company‚Äôs stock plunge, a drop in consensus earnings estimates and disappointing studio content as he has pushed for a board shake-up.  CEO Bob Iger has publicly addressed Disney‚Äôs theatrical release woes and vowed to rely less on sequels and more on fresh, quality films. Of course, production timelines are often in the ballpark of 18 months, so Disney‚Äôs box office haul likely will not change until 2025 or 2026. At that point, Disney is slated to release four mega blockbusters: an Avatar film, two Star Wars features and an Avengers team-up flick.  Also of note to investors is this is the second quarter that Disney is using its new financial reporting structure, which segmented the company into three divisions: entertainment, sports and experiences. Entertainment contains all of Disney‚Äôs streaming and media operations, sports includes ESPN and experiences includes the company‚Äôs theme parks, hotels, cruise line and merchandising efforts.

[Opinions on AMD?,;,; Hey guys. Wanted to get some more experienced people's opinions. I don't know if this kind of post is allowed or not. If not, I apologize and feel free to remove. So I'm a pc gamer and have noticed AMD has been popping off in all aspects. Almost nothing bad has been said about them this generation and I have heard and seen a lot of people moving from Intel and nvidia to AMD. I bought some calls on it since I believe it to continue to go up. These are my current options, it's not much, but I'm a beginner. And before anyone says it, I know people recommend to not do options early on and I understand why. I'm not afraid of losing the little bit of money I have in there. My goal is to get some decent chunks of change from AMD's calls and reinvest the profits into actual shares and using the original investment into calls again.

[3 soaring stocks that show no signs of slowing down,;,; \-Nvidia has bounced back this year from its dismal 2022, and enthusiasm for AI can continue to drive shares higher.    \-Taiwan Semiconductor is poised to benefit from a multi-decade growth runway for chips.    \-General Electric's incredible run isn't over yet.  **These chip and industrial stocks have tons of upside potential.**    No matter how long you've been investing, you've probably heard the phrase "buy low, sell high." But it's not that easy. In fact, following this advice can frequently result in money being left on the table. Outsized gains are typically realised over a multi-year period by allowing winning positions to compound. The best companies have a habit of improving their fundamentals until they reach a premium valuation. This has been the case with a company like Apple, which has effectively compounded its earnings (and bought back its stock) to justify a sustained valuation expansion. Nvidia ($NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing ($TSM), and General Electric ($GE) are three well-known stocks that are currently on fire but may still be worth investing in.  **Nvidia is a smart way to invest in AI**    Scott Levine (Nvidia): Falling more than 50% in 2022, Nvidia's stock has roared back in 2023. Since the start of the year, shares of Nvidia have skyrocketed about 160%. While the stock had climbed steadily through the first four months of the year, most recently the catalyst behind the stock's rise was a strong first-quarter 2024 earnings report and guidance for Q2 2024. And, despite the stock's meteoric climb this year, there's still reason to believe shares can fly even higher.        In all likelihood, most investors recognize Nvidia for its prowess in graphics processing units (GPUs). What many may not know, however, is that the company is also at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) -- an area that has exploded in popularity recently thanks to ChatGPT. While Nvidia played a pivotal role in the development of ChatGPT, the company's AI offerings transcend this one AI chatbot.  Thanks to its industry-leading GPUs -- critical components in training AI -- Nvidia is highly sought after by companies developing AI systems. In late March, for example, Nvidia announced that Alphabet's Google Cloud will be the first cloud services provider to use its L4 GPU for assisting in the development of large generative AI models. A variety of other industry leaders also rely on Nvidia for their AI platforms, including AT&amp;T, Oracle, and Adobe.        With Nvidia's recent rise, the stock is trading at a premium. Currently, shares are valued at 68 times forward earnings. With this steep price tag, it wouldn't be surprising if investors choose to take profits, resulting in a slight decline. Over the long term, though, with some analysts forecasting the generative AI market to rise from $11.3 billion to $51.8 billion in 2028, Nvidia is well positioned to see its stock outperform the market -- especially since the company relies on much more than simply its AI solutions to keep the lights on.  **Taiwan Semi has it all**    Daniel Foelber (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing): Shares of Taiwan Semi have rebounded nicely after a brutal 2022. And for good reason. The stock had sold off primarily due to concerns about a slowing economy (which impacts cyclical chip stocks) and Taiwan Semi's geopolitical risk with China. The industry leader now sells for an inexpensive valuation -- sporting a price-to-earnings ratio of 14 (near a 10-year low).        Shares of Taiwan Semi got an additional boost after Nvidia blew expectations out of the water and soared to a new all-time high. While Taiwan Semi doesn't have the direct exposure to AI that a chip company like Nvidia does, it does provide a catch-all way to benefit from a rising tide in AI and robotics.  Taiwan Semi operates a third-party foundry business that receives designs from customers like Apple, Nvidia, and Advanced Micro Devices (among others) and manufactures chips to their specifications. In this vein, Taiwan Semi is one of the more straightforward ways to indirectly benefit from a growing chip industry. Instead of building a new factory and hoping customers come knocking on the door, Taiwan Semi's expansions are more so in response to its customers demanding higher volumes and increasingly sophisticated products.        There's a short list of third-party foundries that can handle a surge in chip manufacturing as a result of AI and other trends -- giving Taiwan Semi a wide moat in addition to massive growth potential. The biggest risk for this company is geopolitical. However, it is combating that risk by expanding outside of Taiwan with a new 4-nanometer fab in Arizona and a sophisticated technology fab in Japan (both are expected to come online in late 2024).         With an inexpensive valuation, industry leadership, growth opportunities, cheap-looking shares, and a 1.9% dividend yield to boot, there's a lot to like about Taiwan Semi stock -- even though it's run up a lot in the last month.  **GE's end markets keep improving**    Lee Samaha (General Electric): The industrial powerhouse General Electric is up over 55% in 2023 but still has room to run. The reasoning behind this argument is that all three of its end markets continue to improve.    GE is a much smaller company now than in Jack Welch and Jeff Immelt's heydays. Following the healthcare spinoff early this year, GE is now focused on aerospace (mainly commercial with some defense exposure), power (especially gas turbines and services), and renewable energy (wind power and grid solutions).    In aerospace, GE continues to enjoy the benefits of the recovery in commercial aerospace and a gradually improving supply chain. GE Aerospace grew orders by 14% in the first quarter, and its joint venture with Safran, CFM International, is on track to ramp up production of its LEAP engines by 50% in 2023. While the LEAP comes with a negative engine margin, it generates highly lucrative aftermarket revenue spread over decades as the engines are used.    In addition, GE Aerospace may have an opportunity to take market share on the Airbus A320 neo family of aircraft. Its competitor on the airplane, Raytheon Technologies' geared turbofan engine (GTF), has disappointed some airlines with durability issues in harsh environments.    GE Power is heading for another solid year, with management forecasting low-single-digit revenue growth and "slightly better" operating profit than in 2022. However, given that the natural gas price has fallen by 74% over the last year and 33% this year, it's likely that gas turbine usage will increase, leading to more services revenue and a possible increase in investment in gas turbines.    Finally, the infrastructure bill is unleashing pent-up demand in GE's core market, U.S. onshore. As such, GE Renewable Energy orders rose 94% in the first quarter to $5.4 billion, driven by onshore wind and two large grid solutions orders to connect renewable energy sources to the grid.    Given the strengthening momentum in its end markets, there's plenty of reason to believe the industrial company could exceed its earnings guidance.,;,; 2023-05-30 09:53:39]
[NVDA shares have tripled in 2023, while the Nasdaq-100 has climbed 38% and the S&amp;P 500 has gained 16%,;,; AI Mania Triggers Dot-Com Bubble Flashbacks  Nvidia shares have nearly tripled this year. Investors question whether the stock can live up to the hype.  The dot-com bubble taught investors to be wary of stock-market rallies powered by a technological boom‚Äîthat is, until generative artificial intelligence sent tech stocks soaring this year.  Shares of Nvidia NVDA -0.39%, the graphics-chip maker at the heart of the frenzy, have nearly tripled in 2023, while the Nasdaq-100 has climbed 38% and the S&amp;P 500 has gained 16%.  For some investors, the surge in Nvidia‚Äînow the fifth-largest U.S. company by market value‚Äîis difficult to chalk up to anything but speculative mania. Its weighting in the benchmark stock indexes means everyday investors are at the whims of its trajectory, whether they believe in AI‚Äôs potential or not.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge boom in AI‚Äîsome people are scrambling to get exposure at any cost, while others are sounding the alarm that this will end in tears,‚Äù said Kai Wu, founder and chief investment officer of Sparkline Capital. ‚ÄúInvestors can benefit from innovation-led growth, but must be wary of overpaying for it.‚Äù  Nvidia is the primary producer of semiconductors backing artificial-intelligence systems. The company forecast a record $11 billion in sales for the recently ended quarter when it reported results in May, catching analysts off guard with the projected surge in customer demand.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when the excitement around AI really ramped up,‚Äù said Ryan McCormack, an Invesco senior exchange-traded fund strategist.   The hype has driven companies such as Meta Platforms and Amazon.com that have been building out AI capabilities, he said. Shares of the tech giants are up 154% and 65% in 2023, respectively. Microsoft, which has climbed 35%, has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, a chatbot that can answer difficult questions in seconds.  The furious rally in those stocks, long the market‚Äôs biggest drivers, has fanned worries about market concentration. The 10 biggest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 now comprise more than a third of the market, according to Dow Jones Market Data. They represented 27% of the index at the start of the year and less than a quarter in 2000.  ‚ÄúThe market story that rhymes most with the internet bubble is the concentration of leadership,‚Äù said Mike Edwards, deputy chief investment officer of Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers.  Nvidia‚Äôs second-quarter earnings report, due Aug. 23, will provide insight into whether its inexorable rise is well-rooted in demand for chips, or a product of hype. The stock gained 24% in the trading session after its earnings reported in May, and 14% the day following February‚Äôs results.  Investors are paying up for the shares, betting on a windfall down the line. Nvidia is trading at 41 times its sales from the last 12 months, according to FactSet, compared with 2.4 times sales for the S&amp;P 500. On a forward basis, the stock trades at 20 times its expected sales for the year ahead‚Äîdouble its average over the last decade of 10 times, according to Dow Jones Market Data.   The nascency of AI programs such as ChatGPT means it is likely too early to determine whether Nvidia can raise revenue in line with the eye-watering valuation investors have slapped on its shares. If the company‚Äôs growth isn‚Äôt enough to reflect its price, the stock could crater.  A basket of 43 high-multiple internet stocks‚Äîthose worth at least $5 billion that traded at 25 times their revenue at the turn of the century‚Äîcrashed 80% over the next two years, according to Sparkline.   The companies weren‚Äôt duds, either. Their sales grew 10-fold in the ensuing two decades. But investors were badly bruised from the bust: The shares returned an average of 16% in that time span. The S&amp;P 500 returned 284%.  The basket included Amazon and Microsoft, both darlings of today‚Äôs market, along with Cisco Systems, then one of the largest companies in the Nasdaq-100. The networking- equipment maker traded as high as 38 times its sales in early 2000. Cisco has returned 43% since the start of the century‚Äîit is down 0.4% when excluding dividends.  ‚ÄúValuations matter,‚Äù said Wu. ‚ÄúInvesting in stocks exposed to rapidly growing technologies only works if the growth is not already priced in. Unfortunately, in periods of euphoria, the market has a tendency not only to price in potential growth, but to greatly overextrapolate it.‚Äù  One reason why this rally might lack the boom-and-bust nature of the dot-com bubble: The beneficiaries of artificial intelligence were the stocks already shining this year. Investors were flocking to big tech in the first quarter, seeking shelter in strong balance sheets and cash flows.  Tech companies are also benefiting from the expected end of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest-rate campaign and resilient consumer spending. Cyclical sectors of the broader market have begun to catch up now that recession fears are fading.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like 1999 when investors were racing to hot IPOs for companies that had no chance of making money,‚Äù said Edwards. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs winners are disciplined, enormous companies that have moats in place and data sets to exploit.‚Äù,;,; 2023-08-11 12:53:17]

[Any good media creation companies to invest that benefit from AI?,;,; Hey   ADBE actually did pretty good these past month relative to other tech companies (excluding Nvidia). I suspect this might be due to its new features involving AI like the generative fill took in photoshop. I work in VFX and it is frankly quite incredible. I see new innovations in Image creation with AI, most recently the one where you can costumize text or shapes that the AI replicates, that can be implemented in the future. After effects is also benefiting from AI with their roto rush tool. Adobe is a company that actually currently offers something tangible with AI.   So my question is, are there other public media creation companies that could potentially offer stuff using AI in the near future? Nvidia is offering new ways to raytrace and generate 3d environments, but I'm seeking  companies other than NVIDIA and ADOBE.  For example, if you take a look at two minute papers, the text to video is progressing pretty fast. I'm particularly surprised by how good the particle simulation is advancing, which may eventually be an viable option for particle/smoke effects rather than using houdini.

[TSMC warns of deepening chip slump as AI boom fails to offset economic woes,;,; The world‚Äôs biggest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, has warned of a deepening semiconductor slump, as the boom in artificial intelligence fails to offset global economic woes and China‚Äôs delayed recovery.  TSMC now expects its 2023 revenue to drop by 10 per cent, rather than the less than 5 per cent it forecast three months ago, the Taiwanese company told investors on Thursday. This would translate into a 15 per cent revenue decrease in the second half of the year, compared with the same period in 2022.  ‚ÄúThree months ago we were probably more optimistic, but now [we are] not. The recovery of the Chinese economy is weaker than we thought, so end-market demand is not as we expected,‚Äù said CC Wei, chief executive. ‚ÄúAlthough we have very good AI end-market demand, it is not enough to offset [that weakness].‚Äù  The warning comes as the growth of large language models behind generative AI services such as ChatGPT is boosting the need for high-end processors for data centres, with TSMC making chips for Nvidia, whose AI processor business is booming.  https://www.ft.com/content/f433971d-fd8e-4ed3-91e9-e25a96284ea0,;,; 2023-07-20 17:18:11]
[Arm shares spike 24% after chip designer gives strong forecast, says AI is increasing sales,;,; Arm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat estimates and gave a strong profit forecast for the current quarter. The shares soared more than 20% in extended trading.  Here‚Äôs how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending December:  Revenue: $824 million, vs. $761 million expected  EPS: 29 cents adjusted, vs 25 cents expected.   Arm, whose chip design technology is in nearly every smartphone and many PCs, said it expects earnings per share for the fiscal fourth quarter of between 28 cents and 32 cents on sales of $850 million to $900 million. Analysts expectations earnings of 21 cents per share on sales of $780 million.  The company reported net income of $87 million, or 8 cents per share. Total revenue in the quarter increased 14% from a year earlier.  Arm makes money through royalties, when companies pay for access to build Arm-compatible chips, usually amounting to a small percentage of the final chip price.  Arm said its customers shipped 7.7 billion Arm chips during the September quarter, which is the most recent period which figures are available.  Royalty revenue increased 11% on an annual basis to $470 million. The company said the jump was partially because of a recovery in the smartphone market, as well as increasing sales to automotive companies and cloud providers. Arm said that it expects growth to be driven by royalty revenue.  In recent years, Arm has emphasized its licensing business, selling access to more complete designs that semiconductor companies can take and plug into their planned chips. That process saves chipmakers time and effort, and it‚Äôs more lucrative for Arm than simply collecting royalties.  Arm‚Äôs license and other revenue was $354 million, up 18% year-over-year. Arm said more companies were choosing to license its CPU designs to run artificial intelligence, and that the company charges higher licensing fees for advanced designs.  Arm, which had been owned by SoftBank, went public in September. The company was founded in 1990 to develop technology for low-power chips, but became more important to the overall technology industry when the Apple  iPhone and competing Android devices standardized on Arm-based chips.  Arm says that companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia use its technology.  Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/07/arm-earnings-report-q3-2024-.html,;,; 2024-02-07 21:43:28]

[Taiwan Semi (TSMC) will be 'back to strong growth in 2024' - JPMorgan (holding small position),;,; Missing explosive Nvidia growth in 2023 my small play in AI has become TSMC (next to MSFT). This is the company that actually makes Nvidia's chips (and Alphabet's, and Apple's and many others). I had my eyes on ASML too, but it seems too expensive especially in the light of recent China export restrictions.  JPMorgan released a note today covering Taiwan Semi (TSMC), saying it expects will be back to strong growth in 2024, while the Intel competition concerns seem overstated;  *Analysts, who have a Buy rating on the stock, raised the TSMC price target to NT$750 from NT$700.The investment bank expects TSMC to bounce back to \~20% revenue growth in 2024, led by inventory restocking, strong AI demand, and the rapid expansion in N3."Looking ahead, we believe N3 is likely to drive strong growth into 2025, while early progress on N2 looks promising, despite market concerns about competition," wrote the analysts.While Intel competition has been weighing down the stock, JPMorgan's analysis indicates Intel outsourcing to TSMC is likely to outweigh any market share Intel Foundry takes away from TSMC in the next three to four years."In the near-term, we expect TSMC to guide for 1Q24 revs to decline only 3-4% QoQ and indicate a healthy demand recovery at 2024 in its upcoming earnings conference, although GMs may remain under pressure due to higher depreciation costs, N3 dilution, and strong TWD," added the analysts.*  Link: https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/taiwan-semi-will-be-back-to-strong-growth-in-2024--jpmorgan-432SI-3267293,;,; 2024-01-04 15:14:36]

[Investors Are Bailing on Cathie Wood‚Äôs Popular ARK Fund.,;,;  Cathie Wood‚Äôs flagship exchange-traded fund has rallied more than 50% this year. Investors are using that as an opportunity to get out.  They have pulled a net $717 million from the ARK Innovation ETF over the past 12 months, according to FactSet. That exodus marks a notable shift for a fund that had consistently drawn investor cash since its 2014 inception. Once the largest actively managed ETF with nearly $30 billion in assets under management, the fund has shrunk to roughly $9 billion, mostly due to investment losses.  Known by its ticker symbol ARKK, Wood‚Äôs fund became an investor darling shortly after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic with hugely successful bets on unprofitable and ‚Äúdisruptive‚Äù technology companies. It took in huge amounts of investor money, culminating with a $6.5 billion inflow in the first quarter of 2021, when its share price peaked.  Then, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs fastest interest-rate hiking campaign in decades crushed the valuations of unprofitable growth companies, which often attract investors when interest rates are low and returns on safer investments such as CDs are minimal. Shares of ARKK plunged 67% in 2022, but its investors largely held on or bought the dip. Now, analysts say they expect some of those investors are getting out for good.  ‚ÄúYou have a whole group of people who got in somewhere near the top and are sitting on horrific losses,‚Äù said Matthew Tuttle, chief executive of Tuttle Capital Management, which operates an inverse ETF that lets investors bet against Wood‚Äôs fund. ‚ÄúI think some of those people have said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm never getting back to even; this is probably the best I‚Äôm going to do, and it‚Äôs time to get out.‚Äô‚Äù  Wood says the outflows have been small compared with the fund‚Äôs assets.  ‚ÄúWe have been astonished at our asset retention since February of ‚Äò21,‚Äù Wood said in an interview. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very small number as a percentage of assets, which suggests that it‚Äôs far more likely to be people who are taking some profits than some exodus of people who have stayed in the fund through a prolonged down period.‚Äù  Despite the recent rally, ARKK shares are trading about 70% below their all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 has climbed 17% this year on hopes the Fed is near the end of its tightening effort; it is still down 6.1% from its early 2022 high.  ARKK‚Äôs top five holdings are Tesla, Coinbase Global, Roku, Zoom Video Communications and Block. Only Tesla and Zoom were profitable last year. Tesla holds an 11% weight in the fund, helping power its advance this year. Shares of the electric-vehicle maker have more than doubled in 2023 but, like ARKK, are down sharply from their previous high.  Although technology stocks are strongly back in favor this year, the best performers have mostly been mature, profitable companies that generate significant cash, such as Microsoft and Amazon.com. Unlike two years ago, investors appear to have less interest and patience for companies that aren‚Äôt expected to turn a profit until years in the future. Higher interest rates have meant there is a much higher opportunity cost to wait for profitability.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs certainly been a change in sentiment from when the ARK funds were doing really well,‚Äù said Aniket Ullal, head of ETF data and analytics at CFRA Research. ‚ÄúA lot of the stocks the ETF holds won‚Äôt have big cash flows until way out in the future, and it‚Äôs a more challenging environment for that with rates expected to be higher for longer.‚Äù  Investors say the ARK brand lost its luster after the fund‚Äôs prodigious fall. It took another hit after missing out on the monster rally in shares of Nvidia, the graphics-chip maker at the heart of the boom of interest in artificial-intelligence technology. ARKK sold the last of its Nvidia position in January, a stake that had long been one of its largest holdings. Nvidia has been the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs best performer this year, more than tripling.  ‚ÄúThe bloom is off the rose a little bit,‚Äù Tuttle said.  Wood says the negative publicity over the past two years has been an opportunity for ARK to solidify its brand as an asset manager focused on disruptive innovation.  ‚ÄúI can tell you at the end of ‚Äô20 and early ‚Äò21, when we couldn‚Äôt do anything wrong and people were just chasing, I felt very uncomfortable,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúToday, I feel very comfortable. We are not seeing that kind of behavior. That tells me there is a wall of worry out there. And that usually sustains a bull market.‚Äù  The outflows at ARK are coming while ETF investors appear eager to put money to work in other funds. June was the best month for equity ETF flows since October, according to State Street, while active funds attracted $10 billion of inflows for the month and more than $100 billion over the past 12 months.  Investors displayed ‚Äúchildlike exuberance‚Äù and ‚Äújumped into the market‚Äôs rally with both feet,‚Äù Matthew Bartolini, head of Americas research for State Street‚Äôs ETF business, said in a research note.  The ARKK fund has an 11% annualized average return since inception, but the average ARKK investor has lost 21% on a dollar-weighted, annualized basis, according to FactSet.  ‚ÄúARKK shareholders have not timed their purchases well. Many bought high and have yet to sell,‚Äù said Elisabeth Kashner, director of global funds research at FactSet.  The fund remains a cash cow for Wood, who owns a majority stake in its parent company, ARK Investment Management. Its 0.75% annual fee is about double the average fee for active ETFs.  Although fee revenue is well off its 2021 peak, ARKK has generated more than $20 million of fees this year. ARK Investment Management currently has the third-highest daily revenue from active equity ETFs, of at least 145 different issuers, according to an analysis from FactSet.  To be sure, the market comeback staged by many of ARKK‚Äôs tech-focused holdings surprised many, highlighting the perils of trying to forecast performance.  ‚ÄúIf you just look at rates, you would not have expected this great rebound in growth coming into the year,‚Äù said Dana D‚ÄôAuria, co-chief investment officer at Envestnet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a classic window into why market prognostication doesn‚Äôt work. Who would have thought artificial intelligence would boom and create this massive interest?‚Äù  https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-are-bailing-on-cathie-woods-popular-ark-fund-dbf5d801?mod=hp_lead_pos2,;,; 2023-07-16 21:48:07]

[Passive investing bubble brought to you in part by ETF‚Äôs,;,; So you know how in most of the melt up‚Äôs/meltdowns there‚Äôs usually a product that‚Äôs largely responsible?  Usually no one can see it coming, in 2007/8 it was overlevering bad loans through CDO‚Äôs.  Today I was trying to track where the volume was coming from on one of my stocks. I found a declaration of 5% ownership by Blackrock in the SEC filings. So this pointed me towards their Ishares line of ETF‚Äôs. These ‚Äúmodified market cap weighted‚Äù ETF‚Äôs seem to forget the market cap weighted in favour of the modified part.   Money is being channeled by Vangaurd, Blackrock Etc‚Ä¶ into a select few ‚Äúunicorns‚Äù. I believe that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs no breadth in rallies, the passive investing money hose is selectively focused.   The investing mandates are created when the ETF‚Äôs are established, so all that‚Äôs left to do is rebalance. What results from this? The investment mandate might make sense at the time, all of this passive investing pushes the price to levels where the fundamentals don‚Äôt quite make sense anymore. The fund managers don‚Äôt give a shit, and why would they? It‚Äôs not their money and the more they have under management the more they‚Äôre earning in management fees. The folks supplying the money are too far removed from the investing to see what‚Äôs happening. They buy these ‚Äúdiversified ETF‚Äôs‚Äù that are professionally rebalanced and diversified with the premise of releasing control to the experts.  Here‚Äôs an example: why are AMD and NVIDIA almost equally weighted in the SOXX ETF given that NVIDIA is roughly 6x the size of AMD? They should be weighted proportional to their market caps. When fund managers place this metaphorical finger on the scale it creates buying pressure. ETF‚Äôs are enabling market makers to use other people‚Äôs money to move the markets. This can snowball as the companies that are given a larger allocation in the semi-actively managed ETF‚Äôs gain a larger market cap. As the companies market cap becomes a larger portion of the index the passively managed ETF‚Äôs begin allocating a larger percent to the company and so on‚Ä¶  I would also hypothesize that more young people are turning to the markets to get ahead more than ever. Let‚Äôs face it, the rich housing markets seem out of reach for a lot of people these days. Higher interest rates perpetuate this further. I would be curious to know how many of you also see the equity markets as your means to get ahead in the midst of unaffordable real estate.  What are your thoughts on this? Poke holes in my ideas if you see flaws. Add to the idea if there‚Äôs another angle that you see in this line of thought.  I‚Äôm fairly convinced that we‚Äôre going to see a meltdown. CRE will likely be one of the catalysts. Office space is very difficult to convert to residential. The logistics of plumbing additional bathrooms, space planning, fixturing appliances etc‚Ä¶ make it very expensive.   Thanks for reading.,;,; 2024-02-11 04:58:59]
[Softbank files for ARM IPO. Looking to raise $8-10b. I'm not buying.,;,; Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sndmzr/softbanks\_arm\_to\_ipo\_buyers\_beware/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sndmzr/softbanks_arm_to_ipo_buyers_beware/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  **Edit: People are very confused about how ARM licensing works. Read this explanation first:**  &gt;ARM licenses its [ISA](https://developer.arm.com/architectures/instruction-sets) and/or stock CPU designs to companies. Some companies license both. They pay more. Some companies only license the ISA. They pay less. Apple only licenses the ISA, for example.   Apple's ARM-based designs actually compete with ARM's stock designs. This is why your iPhone is always faster than Android phones.   Yes, Apple is both a customer and a competitor to ARM.   Stock ARM chips are used by companies like Qualcomm, Mediatek, etc. But slowly, these companies are moving away from them and they're designing their own ARM-based chips. This means ARM will make less money from them and they too, will become both customers and competitors to ARM.   ARM's biggest customers are an existential threat to ARM's most profitable business.  I'm not buying. While I believe that ARM CPUs will continue to take marketshare away from x86 on laptops, desktops, and servers, I don't believe the company will be that profitable.  Despite licensing its IP and being at the core of the mobile world, ARM's business model makes peanuts compared to Apple, Qualcomm, AMD, Intel, Nvidia. ARM's last reported revenue was $2b/year. Apple makes that in 1.5 days. Microsoft makes 88x more. Intel makes 39x more. Qualcomm makes 17x more.  In essence, ARM can't compete with the big boys and far more profitable companies are poaching their talent. Take for example, Mike Filippo, a lead architect at ARM, was poached by Apple then poached by Microsoft.  ARM simply can't compete with the money that big tech can throw at their top employees. If you're a top student graduate, you're going to Apple/Intel/AMD/Nvidia. You're not going to ARM Austin Texas. Whenever a big tech company wants to build a custom ARM chip, they go raid ARM talent.  This basically means ARM won't be able to match the performance of big tech designs with their stock ARM cores. And it shows because Apple Silicon is far ahead of stock ARM cores, Qualcomm themselves will be building custom ARM cores again, and Ampere is [ditching stock ARM cores](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16684/ampere-roadmap-full-custom-cores) for their own custom server cores.  Companies that only rely on the ARM ISA pay far less in licensing fees than companies that also license ARM core designs.  Nvidia buying ARM would have injected the capital needed to compete with Apple, Qualcomm, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, AMD, Intel designs and future designs. And it would have been cool to see ARM SoCs with Nvidia IP. I was/am [one of the few people](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/s1r0w8/nvidia_was_approached_by_softbank_to_buy_arm_not/hsb30a6/?context=3) on Reddit who actually liked the deal. The vast majority of people were in the camp of "zomg Nvidia closed source monopoly price fixing omg". Reddit hive mind is real.  Anyways, I'm bullish on custom ARM designs long-term. I'm bearish on ARM the company because their stock cores can't compete with high-end custom ARM cores and high-end x86 cores. If their stock cores can't outperform custom cores, then they will be reduced to small licensing fees forever. This doesn't justify their $40b+ valuation. Every big player in the mobile space is making tens or hundreds of billions. Somehow the tech that is crucial to the mobile world is making peanuts. This isn't going to change and might get worse.  ARM is essential but not a cash cow and has no potential to be a cash cow.  There is no doubt that Softbank saw the same thing and wanted to unload ARM. First, by trying to sell it to a company that valued its technology more than its financials. Now by trying to IPO. Buyers beware.,;,; 2023-05-01 13:12:08]

[What market trends are you BULLISH on in 2024?,;,; Hey all! Just trying to familiarize myself with some of the most talked about investment opportunities in the market right now as well as potential stock picks for each. Feel free to correct any info here or add on more. Just looking to start a discussion on the different hot topics lately and the following stock picks that go along with them! I know there are several other big opportunities like weed,crypto,etc just didn‚Äôt wanna go overboard   **Lithium ( MALRY, LAC)**   The booming EV market, along awith the growing demand for renewable energy storage, positions lithium as a key investment opportunity. Major automaker's substantial investments in EVs drive the need for lithium-ion batteries, while the increasing focus on sustainable energy ensures a sustained demand for lithium. Despite global lithium deposits, the challenge of securing a stable and cost-effective supply persists, presenting investment potential in companies involved in lithium exploration, mining, and battery production.     **GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, INTL )**   Demand for GPUs comes from AI and machine learning for handling big data in areas like healthcare and finance. Data centers need GPUs for cloud computing as businesses shift operations online. In the gaming industry, GPUs are crucial for high-quality graphics in video games. Cryptocurrency mining, particularly for coins like Ethereum, relies on GPUs for their processing power. Overall, the demand is driven by the growing need for high-performance GPUs in AI, data centers, gaming, and cryptocurrency mining.   **Uranium (BHP, NXE )**   The demand for uranium primarily stems from its crucial role in fueling nuclear power generation. As global efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources intensify, the demand for nuclear energy has been on the rise, particularly in emerging economies like China and India. This growing demand, coupled with supply constraints and geopolitical factors affecting uranium production, creates a decent investment opportunity. As countries strive to meet their energy needs while minimizing carbon emissions, uranium stands out as a key component in the clean energy landscape.   &amp;#x200B;  Are you betting on any of these?

The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple (AAPL.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O), has benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence applications that has helped it weather the tapering off of pandemic-led demand.   Revenue in the final three months of last year came in at T$625.5 billion ($20.10 billion), according to Reuters calculations, compared with $19.93 billion in the year-ago period.  That beat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (TSMC) previous prediction for fourth-quarter revenue being in a range of between $18.8-19.6 billion, and also beat an LSEG SmartEstimate of T$617.1 billion drawn from 21 analysts.     *Source:* [https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmcs-december-sales-down-84-yy-2024-01-10/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmcs-december-sales-down-84-yy-2024-01-10/),;,; 2024-01-10 20:51:34]
[Seeking Opinions on Semiconductor Giants and Uranium Stocks,;,; Hello r/stocks community,        I've been closely observing the market trends and have a keen interest in two specific sectors: semiconductors and uranium. With the undeniable surge in AI popularity, companies like NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel seem to be at a crucial juncture.   I‚Äôm curious about your perspective on these companies. Do you think they are well-positioned to capitalize on the AI boom? Should I invest now ?        Furthermore, with the growing emphasis on clean energy, uranium stocks like Uranium Energy Corp are catching my eye. In your view, is this an opportune time to invest in such companies?            I would greatly appreciate insights, analyses, or any personal opinions. Whether it's based on technical analysis, market trends, or just gut feeling, all thoughts are welcome!        Thank you in advance for your valuable input!,;,; 2024-01-18 12:12:35]
[Intel stock drops 6% as company updates chip manufacturing plans,;,;    * Intel stock dropped 6% Wednesday after the company gave investors an update on the company‚Äôs turnaround plan to become a foundry competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. * Intel‚Äôs new reporting structure could help control costs at the chipmaker, which is seeking to trim as much as $10 billion from its costs over the next three years. * Other chip stocks also fell Wednesday amid a down day for tech stocks.   Intel stock dropped 6% Wednesday after the company gave investors an update on the company‚Äôs turnaround plan to become a chip manufacturing company competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.  Wednesday‚Äôs update featured Intel‚Äôs Chief Financial Officer David Zinsner explaining how the company would soon change the way it reports its financial results to give its foundry business, known as IFS, its own profit-and-loss statement, which would reveal the company‚Äôs manufacturing margins.  Intel‚Äôs new reporting structure could also help control costs at the chipmaker, which is seeking to trim as much as $10 billion from its costs over the next three years.  The update comes as investors continue to assess Intel‚Äôs turnaround plan under CEO Pat Gelsinger, which depends on catching up with TSMC‚Äôs manufacturing technology by 2026, a plan it calls ‚Äúfive nodes in four years.‚Äù Intel plans to use its own chips to work out problems in its manufacturing before opening the factories to third-party companies.  If Intel catches up with TSMC, then it can compete for contracts to build high-performance chips from companies such as Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm  , which don‚Äôt run their own manufacturing and currently often opt for TSMC or Samsung manufacturing. Intel said it expected to announce a key customer for its foundry business later this year.  ‚ÄúThe manufacturing group will now face the same market dynamics as their foundry counterparts,‚Äù Zinsner told analysts. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll need to compete for volume through performance and price as internal customers will have the option to leverage third-party foundries and to attract external foundry volume, they must do the same.‚Äù  Wednesday‚Äôs update was focused on how Intel would use its manufacturing capabilities for its own chips. It said more updates on the foundry business and third-party customers would come later this year. Intel also said its own chip needs would contribute $20 billion in revenue to the unit next year.  Analysts on the call worried about Intel‚Äôs gross margins and asked how this plan would increase them. In April, Intel said its gross margin for the first quarter was 38.4%, down 51.3% in a year. Intel management said Wednesday it was shooting for 60% margins.  Separately, Intel said Wednesday that it planned to sell 20% of an Austrian subsidiary, IMS Nanofabrication, to private equity firm Bain Capital in a deal that valued the unit at $4.3 billion.  ‚ÄúThis will turn out to be one of the best acquisitions we‚Äôve ever made, given that level of valuation and investment made,‚Äù Zinsner said Wednesday.  Other chip stocks also fell Wednesday amid a down day for tech stocks. AMD  , Intel‚Äôs chief rival, fell nearly 6%, while Qualcomm fell more than 3%. Nvidia, which has been boosted by the recent artificial intelligence wave, fell less than 2%.,;,; 2023-06-22 05:20:53]
[How do you buy more an individual stock that seems to be going up ... up ... up,;,; This is one thing that has always confounded me about investing ... if you zero in on a stock that you think is at a good price, and buy  some of it, what strategies do you employ to continue investing in that stock if it starts to rise rapidly and you don't have as much of the stock as you'd like? (examples are Uber, Shopify, AMD or Nvidia)     Do you dollar cost average into the stock, or just stack up on cash and wait to buy on dips? if you  buy on dips, then how much of a dip do you buy on? What happens when the stock inevitably moves past the level you were comfortable buying at?

[Intel shows Gaudi3 AI accelerator, promising quadruple BF16 performance in 2024, is Intel a buy now considering its low valuation,;,; I have long been an Intel bag holder. Intel is now the biggest position in my portfolio. I was once down about 50% on my position, but doubled down few times on Intel, now the investment is +5%  I have been holding on to Intel for the following reasons:  1, Attractive valuation, compared to Nvidia and AMD  2, Intel is the only US chip manufacturer, so when manufacturing is coming back on-shore in the US, Intel should be the biggest beneficiary. God forbid China invades Taiwan  3, Intel will catch up on AI and it should drive significant growth in revenue and profits  4, A comeback story, if Intel is successful, this will be huge for the stock  I think the 3rd factor is coming to pass and I may be looking at decent returns in the year to come  What do people think? Am I delusional?,;,; 2023-12-15 17:25:26]
[Bond yields are soaring and prices plummeting,;,; The 20 year treasury yield is about to hit 5%, which is an excellent ‚Äúrisk free‚Äù return. However, this means bond prices continue to decline. With such volatility, it becomes hard to endorse purchasing treasuries right now unless one plans to hold to maturity. Price movements like this suggest buyers believe yields will continue to increase. Which means they believe inflation is going to become a long term problem. This is dangerous for stocks.  What is the right play with bonds right now? My friends in r/LETFs have had their TMF heavy portfolios absolutely wrecked. Relative to stocks, 5% is starting to look downright attractive. Stocks are at near all time highs, and PE ratios are crazy. Nvidia is around 103x earnings. That‚Äôs 103 years to repay one‚Äôs investment.

[When is it better to hold equal-weighted S&amp;P ETF?,;,;  I have some cash I want to put back into the market. Is it better to buy equal-weighted instead of market-cap weighted S&amp;P 500 ETF? Some reasons why:  * Nvidia's advancements is going to "democratize AI" by making it cheaper. This means smaller companies might be able to displace bigger companies.  * I expect a period of growth in the next 6-12 months due to rate hike pausing. In these type of environments investors are going to move out of the safe tech bets (like Apple, Microsoft) and get back into more speculative, smaller cap names.  * I already hold stocks like Google, Amazon, and a lot of Apple &amp; Tesla. I also wheel stocks like FB and Nvidia, so might get stuck with them as well.  Would love your opinions. Or if you just have general thoughts to share about equal vs market cap weighting, that's great as well.,;,; 2023-06-02 18:34:53]
[Intel in talks to serve as anchor for ARM IPO,;,; https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-talks-anchor-investor-arm-014951769.html  &gt;Intel is in talks with SoftBank Group Corp's Arm to be an anchor investor in the chip designer's initial public offering (IPO), a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.  &gt;Arm plans to sell its shares on Nasdaq later this year, seeking to raise between $8 billion and $10 billion, Reuters reported earlier in April.  Great idea for Intel to open a sizable position in ARM as the IPO anchor imo. Intel clearly missed most of the smartphone race apart from some modems before selling even that off, but getting tighter with ARM and becoming the best place to fabricate ARM parts would be a solid addition to the turnaround. Also hedges from singular Nvidia or Apple influence on ARM.,;,; 2023-06-14 23:10:50]

[Intel to invest $4.6 billion in new chip plant in Poland,;,; Intel plans to invest up to $4.6 billion in a new semiconductor assembly and test facility near Wroc≈Çaw, Poland, as part of a multi-billion-dollar investment drive across Europe to build chip capacity, it said on Friday.  The U.S. chipmaker last year announced plans to build a big chip complex in Germany along with facilities in Ireland and France as it seeks to benefit from European Commission's eased funding rules and subsidies as the EU looks to cut its dependence on U.S. and Asian supply.  The facility in Poland will employ 2,000 workers and create several thousand additional jobs during the construction phase and hiring by suppliers, the company said in a statement.  "Poland was just a little bit hungrier to win this site," Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a news conference.  Several countries have been vying to get Intel to invest in their regions and some, like Germany, who have secured a commitment from Intel, have been in talks on the amount of subsidies they can doll out.  Handelsblatt newspaper reported on Thursday that the German government and Intel were close to an agreement for 9.9 billion euros ($10.83 billion) in subsidies, up from a previously agreed 6.8 billion.  "We are not asking for handouts, we are asking for competitiveness," Gelsinger said in an interview.  "Labour costs have gone up substantially, material costs have gone up substantially, so all of a sudden, the cost gap was bigger than we had originally estimated."  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will meet with Gelsinger on Monday, a government spokesperson said in Berlin.  Gelsinger declined to provide detail on the subsidy amount, but said he hopes to come to an agreement.  "The gaps are too big. If we close them, we shake hands, and we are going forward," Gelsinger said.  The level of any subsidy offered to Intel by Poland was not made public during Friday's announcement.  Design and planning for the facility will begin immediately, with construction to commence pending European Commission approval.  Mateusz Morawiecki, prime minister of Poland, called Intel's factory "the largest greenfield investment in the history of Poland".  The company, which has been in the country for 30 years and employs 4,000 workers, said it chose Poland because of its infrastructure, available talent and noted the site is close to its planned factory in Germany and its site in Ireland.  It expects the facility to come online by 2027.  Intel under Gelsinger has been investing billions in building factories across three continents to restore its dominance in chip making and better compete with rivals AMD, NVIDIA and Samsung.  https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-invest-46-bln-new-chip-plant-poland-2023-06-16/,;,; 2023-06-16 12:33:40]

[Where are you building positions?,;,; I have a very small portfolio, about 14k. Over the last few years I lost a very, very substantial amount of money as a % of my portfolio making stupid trades. Mostly trying to be too cute with long dated call options that went terribly in the wrong direction and expired worthless, credit spreads, chasing some WSB tickers. Basically trading like I'm in a literal casino.  The last 18 months or so I've mostly gotten back on the right track and have been building positions in the big names that have been traditionally good bets over a long horizon. Google, apple, Amazon, meta, tesla, Microsoft, Nvidia, visa, you get the idea. I recently started a new job and can comfortably put $1000 a month into the market to chase some growth while equally contributing to my savings.  Something nearly all of these companies have in common is that they are all hovering at or near 52 week highs and while I'm not entirely deterred by that it gives me some pause.  Personally my next thought is to build a bigger position in the s&amp;p and nasdaq indices over the next few months since I'm currently concentrated in individual companies.

Microsoft shares climbed to a record Thursday after analysts at JPMorgan Chase touted the software maker‚Äôs growth prospects in artificial intelligence.  The stock rose 3.2% to close at $348.10, topping its prior all-time high reached in November 2021, the same month the Nasdaq peaked. U.S. indexes enjoyed a broad rally, following the Federal Reserve‚Äôs announcement Wednesday that it would hold off on increasing interest rates.  AI has been a hot topic all year, after Microsoft-backed OpenAI in November released the ChatGPT chatbot, which quickly went viral. Tech companies have rushed to embed the technology into products and features and have boasted their ability to use AI to drive cost savings as recession concerns persist.  Microsoft is a major beneficiary of the rise of ChatGPT and tangential products. On top of its hefty investment in OpenAI, the company provides the underlying computing power. Microsoft also has an exclusive license on OpenAI‚Äôs models, including the GPT-4 large language model that can spit out natural-sounding words in response to a human‚Äôs text input.  Microsoft has incorporated OpenAI tools into its Bing search engine and even the Windows operating system. At the company‚Äôs event in February to announce its Bing Chatbot, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said ‚Äúit‚Äôs an exciting time in tech.‚Äù  Investors want to see what it all means for Microsoft‚Äôs earnings and revenue.  In April, Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood said she expects fiscal fourth-quarter growth for Azure cloud of 26% to 27% year over year in constant currency, with 1 percentage point of it coming from AI services. On Monday, in a public discussion with Microsoft technology chief Kevin Scott, Hood provided more specifics, saying that ‚Äúthe next generation AI business will be the fastest-growing $10 billion business in our history.‚Äù  In the past four quarters, Microsoft has generated almost $208 billion in total revenue.  Scott went deeper on Hood‚Äôs prediction.  ‚ÄúBecause it really is a very general platform, we have lots of different ways that $10 billion of ARR is going to first show up,‚Äù he said. ARR stands for annual recurring revenue.  ‚ÄúThere is all of the people who want to come use our infrastructure, whether they‚Äôre training their own models, whether they are running an open-source model they‚Äôve got or whether they are making API calls into one of the big frontier models that we‚Äôve built with OpenAI,‚Äù Scott said.  Following the event, JPMorgan analysts lifted their price target to $350 from $315.  ‚ÄúWhile MSFT continues to encounter a broad wave of cloud optimizations weighing on Azure growth, we see it planting the longer-term seeds for success across Security, Teams, Power Apps and now the forward-looking OpenAI/ChatGPT investments,‚Äù wrote the analysts, who have the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft stock.  With Microsoft‚Äôs 46% rally this year, the stock has recouped all its losses from 2022, when investors rotated out of technology in anticipation of rising interest rates and economic headwinds.  Negative sentiment around cloud growth and a contracting PC market led to pessimism on Wall Street last year. But the excitement around AI in addition to the cost-cutting measures that tech companies implemented produced a renewed bullishness. The Nasdaq is up 32% this year, doubling the gains in the S&amp;P 500.,;,; 2023-06-16 02:14:37]

[Berlin, Intel strike deal on $33 billion chip plant after months of subsidy talks,;,; BERLIN/STOCKHOLM, June 19 (Reuters) - Intel (INTC.O) will invest more than 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in Germany as part of its expansion push in Europe, the U.S. company said on Monday, a project key to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ambitions to create a global chip hub.        The deal, which involves two leading-edge semiconductor facilities, involves 10 billion euros in German subsidies, a person familiar with the matter said.        Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said he was grateful to the German government and the local state of Saxony-Anhalt, where the company plans to built one plant, for "fulfilling the vision of a vibrant, sustainable, leading-edge semiconductor industry in Germany and the EU".        Under Gelsinger, Intel (INTC.O) has been investing billions in building factories across three continents to restore its dominance in chipmaking and better compete with rivals AMD (AMD.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Samsung (005930.KS).        The deal in Germany would be Intel's third big investment in four days, following a $4.6 billion chip plant in Poland and a $25 billion factory in Israel.        Both the United States and Europe are trying to lure big industrial players via a mix of state subsidies and favourable legislation, with Berlin concerned about losing appeal as a place to invest.        The German government is investing billions of euros in subsidies to lure tech companies to Germany amidst growing alarm over supply chain fragility and dependence on South Korea and Taiwan for chips.        Berlin is currently also talking with Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) and Sweden's electric vehicle battery maker Northvolt about setting up production in Germany, having already convinced Tesla (TSLA.O) to build its first European gigafactory there.        Frankfurt-listed Intel shares were 0.3% lower at 1316 GMT.        The chipmaker last year announced plans to build a big chip complex in Germany, along with facilities in Ireland and France, as it seeks to benefit from the European Commission's eased funding rules and subsidies as the EU tries to cut its dependence on U.S. and Asian supply.        It has not yet specified the exact size of the investment.        Gelsinger told Reuters on Friday that the gap between what Germany had offered and what Intel needed was too big but he expected to reach an agreement, adding that his request was to be cost competitive.        "We lost this industry to Asia, we have to be competitive if we're going to bring it back," he said, adding the overall investment for the site would be "tens of billions of dollars".

[Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) $171 A good long term buy,;,; \#AMD‚Äôs MI300 chips will be its growth engine for the future and the key reason for buying this stock. While I don‚Äôt believe it will get close to Nvidia‚Äôs near monopolistic market share of 80% there is ample room for more competitors and AMD will benefit from the AI boom as well.   It recently upped its guidance for 2024 for artificial intelligence-related revenue to $3.5B up from $2B previously.  $AMD Chief Executive Dr. Lisa Su said she had "good confidence" the company will be able to exceed the $3.5B figure this year and the $1.5B run-rate for the coming fourth-quarter. $1.5Bn run rate implies $6Bn in annual sales.   However, based on Citi analyst estimates, AMD is likely to generate $5B this year and $8B next year from the MI300 - they believe that Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are the largest customers for the MI300, which was unveiled in December to much fanfare. And with the average selling price at roughly $10,000 for Microsoft and $15,000 or more for other customers, it's possible AMD is purposefully underestimating sales figures, possibly on supply concerns?   For Q4-2023 AMD results were in line with expectations   EPS: $0.77 per share, adjusted, versus $0.77 per share expected   Revenue: $6.17 billion, versus $6.12 billion expected   Data Center revenue $2.28Bn in line V $2.29 expected.   Guidance was light:   Q1-24 $5.4Bn in sales, plus or minus $300 million, V $5.73 Bn expected.   Flat data center revenue with server chip declines to be offset by AI GPU sales. We saw weak data center revenue from Intel, this is definitely some cannibalization and likely to continue, till AI GPU starts taking a larger share of the pie.   Client Group - The recovery in PC‚Äôs helped AMD‚Äôs client group, which rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.   Gaming, which includes ‚Äúsemi-custom‚Äù processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù double-digit percentage in the current quarter. This is a low margin business and drags AMD‚Äôs overall margins.   AMD‚Äôs embedded segment, which includes chips for networking, reported $1.1 billion in sales, down 24% on an annual basis.,;,; 2024-02-10 22:08:45]

[Intel surges as Q2 results show PC rebound underway, strong guidance,;,; Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares rose more than 7.5% in extended-hours trading after the semiconductor giant posted second-quarter results that topped estimates and showed signs of a recovery in the PC market.  For the period ending July 1, Intel (INTC) earned an adjusted 13 cents per share on $12.9B in revenue, as the company's Client Computing Group generated $6.78B in revenue, above estimates.¬†  Revenue attributed to its Data Center and AI group fell 15% year-over-year to $4B, while Network and Edge revenue dropped 38% to $1.4B. Intel's nascent foundry unit saw a 307% surge in revenue to $232M.  The company also generated $454M in revenue attributed to Mobileye (MBLY), which it partially spun-off in October 2022.  A consensus of analysts expected ¬†the company to lose 3 cents per share on $12.14B in revenue.  AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose in after-hours trading following the results.  Looking ahead, Intel (INTC) said it expects third-quarter revenue to be between $12.9B and $13.9B, with the mid-point above the $13.28B estimate. It also expects adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share, topping the 13-cent-per-share estimate.  The Santa, Clara, California-based Intel (INTC) also said it is on track to deliver $3B in cost savings this year.  "We remain focused on operational efficiencies and our Smart Capital strategy to support sustainable growth and financial discipline as we improve our margins and cash generation and drive shareholder value," CFO David Zinsner said in a statement.  Intel (INTC) is holding a conference call at 5 p.m. EST to discuss the results.

[Nvdia #NVDA is expensive but still has an excellent future and should be bought on dips.,;,; ‚Ä¢ Nvidia #NVDA an expensive P/S ratio, but a reasonable P/E given its excellent profit margins.  ‚Ä¢ Generational AI growth is definitely not a panacea, but has started to gain traction as use cases expand beyond ChatGPT.  ‚Ä¢ Besides, higher performance computing is becoming a must have.  ‚Ä¢ Its Auto segment is doing extremely well, gaming rebounding, and data center still growing.  ‚Ä¢ Nvidia's new product innovation and exceptional R&amp;D spend allow it to keep its pole position.  I had recommended NVIDA #NVDA at $116 in Oct 2022 as the best in its class -- on strong product innovations such as the new RTX gaming series, and the Hopper and the Grace in data center. Now, its price has more than doubled to $265, helped by the disinflation rally of January 2023, the expected growth from generational AI A100, AI chips that are being used for Microsoft (MSFT) and AI [C3.ai](https://c3.ai/), Inc.

[Looking for niche industries with dominant players/brand loyalty.,;,; Greetings. I'm seeking to source ideas from the wisdom of the crowd. Following a Peter Lynch approach, I've been exploring niche or premium/luxury industries with 1-2 dominant players due to industry consolidation and brand loyalty. The fewer competitors, the better. Let me provide some examples:     * **Nvidia (Prior to AI/Crypto boom):** Before entering the spotlight, Nvidia was in a niche industry (GPUs for PC gaming) with little competition and selling products that could be considered in an enthusiast/premium-tier.  * **Garmin (GRMN):** Garmin holds a robust position in the niche sport watches segment, boasting around 40% market share (but facing fierce competition at the macro level). They offer premium products and enjoy significant brand loyalty. * **Shimano (7309):** I think in categories beyond entry-level; all the bicycle manufacturers/designers use Shimano and SRAM parts. Recently started in the hobby but I have the impression that having Shimano component could make-or-break a sale.   Other (not validated) ideas: OLED (as OLED technology it¬¥s getting mainstream), CUERVO (Tequila industry), perhaps Herman Miller and Steelcase in the premium office chair segment?, Dolby (audio technology) and potentially Sonos in the future.

[Investment plan for about 85 000$ USD over the coming year,;,; So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years.  I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030.  However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.  I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.  The plan:   \-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)   \-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)   \-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)   \-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)   \-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)   \-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)   \-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)  Some possible additions right now:   \-Considering Invesco **S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&amp;P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)   \-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)   \-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)   \-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)   \-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)   \-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)   \-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)   \-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)   \-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)   \-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)  So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?  Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :),;,; 2023-07-17 12:59:33]

[WSJ - S&amp;P 500 ends longest bear market since the 1940s and signals beginning of new bull market.,;,; U.S. stocks rose Thursday, ending the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs longest bear market since the 1940s and marking the start of a new bull run.   The broad index powered higher over the past few months, in large part because of a handful of companies posting outsize gains.  Many of those same stocks, including Amazon.com, Tesla and chip maker Nvidia, led the market‚Äôs advance Thursday.   That helped propel the S&amp;P 500 up 0.6%, allowing the index to finish up 20% from its October low.  The Nasdaq Composite climbed 1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.5% to 33833.  Treasury yields retreated. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was at 3.714%, down from 3.782% Wednesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.  Analysts attributed the relative calm to traders taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of key events next week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release fresh data on inflation Tuesday, while the Federal Reserve will announce its latest interest-rate decision Wednesday.  So far, positioning in futures markets suggests many traders are betting the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged in June. That might offer markets some relief in the short-term, although investors warn that there could still be more policy-tightening ahead.   ‚ÄúA pause does not mean they are done with rate hikes,‚Äù said Tim Courtney, chief investment officer at Exencial Wealth Advisors.   Traders are betting volatility could pick up in the coming months. The options contracts with the biggest positions tied to the Cboe Volatility Index, or Wall Street‚Äôs ‚Äúfear gauge,‚Äù are wagers that it will surge to 30‚Äîa level associated with investor anxiety‚Äîor 60, a level only seen during stock-market crashes.  Among individual stocks, electric-car maker Tesla jumped 4.6% to $234.86, posting its 10th straight session of gains. That marked the company‚Äôs longest winning streak since an 11-session run that ended in January 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data.   Carvana, the online used car retailer, rose 56% to $24.23 after saying it expects its profit to jump in the second quarter.  GameStop plunged 18% to $21.44 after the videogame retailer fired its CEO, Matt Furlong, and appointed board member Ryan Cohen as its new executive chairman.   U.S. crude oil prices initially dropped after a report suggested U.S.-Iran talks on a temporary nuclear deal could allow the Islamic Republic to export more crude. They pared some of their losses by the end of the trading day, though, finishing down 1.7% at $71.29 a barrel.  Global stock markets were mixed.

"Of course, people's intentions change ... but if Netflix is able to entice 25% of current sharers to re-subscribe to their ad-tier, that would translate to 6.8 million net adds and $567 million in incremental annual subscription revenue," MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson explained in the report (registration required). "Net-net, so while this might not be the home run that the Bulls might believe, the near-term opportunity to continue adding subscribers in North America seems very likely. "The survey found that 23% of accounts that engage in password-sharing have received a notice from the streamer that they are in violation of the new policy. Of that group, about 72% have since lost access to their shared account. "This implies Netflix has ample room to go in rolling out warnings and enforcement of this measure," Nathanson wrote. But he allows that there's some squishiness in those findings since it's possible that some survey respondents might not be fully aware they are in violation of Netflix's new rules. Among the group that currently shares a subscription and has not yet lost access to a shared account, 22% either plan to get their own subscription or have already done so. That's a possible indicator that "when push comes to shove, many find themselves missing their Netflix access more than they had thought," Nathanson surmised.*  ***So we know the numbers to draw from are massive*** *(100 million): and these are the* ***gains of subs*** *over the last 4 quarters:* ***Q1***: *1.75mil*, ***Q2***: *5.89mil*, ***Q3***: *9mil*, ***Q4***: *13mil*.  *It stands to reason that the "content" threshold to convert a freeloader to a subscriber is lower than the acquisition of a new subscriber from a competitive market. It's also true that Netflix had to actively entice a freeloader to convert with good content. So is reducing content next year prudent?*  *How much of this growth is password-sharing crackdown? and how much of it is left to draw from? what do the numbers look like going forward?

[Morgan Stanley‚Äôs new client letter on AMD ‚Äî ‚ÄúAl opportunity looks to be multiples of our initial assessment‚Äù,;,; Body of letter:  ‚ÄúWe have tried to set conservative forecasts for AMD's Al, given historic false starts, but higher price points plus supply chain commentary is pointing to an opportunity that is multiples of our initial target. Raising Al revs to $400 mm, but with bull case &gt;$1.2 bn for CY24. We have spent the last few days gathering data points from industry sources on the AMD MI300 (AI) opportunity. Our original estimate of $100 mm of Al revenue in CY24 in addition to other data center GPU such as cloud gaming or supercomputer) was intended to be conservative - and AMD management commentary has also been circumspect - but the opportunity in formation is materially larger.   Our thought process is that 1) the overall inference market for GPUs is only about $400 mm trailing, and while it's clear that growth will be explosive in the near term, AMD is coming from outside the market, and customer's biggest priority is to reduce cost per query so price will be an issue. 2) We have been here before, where customers state enthusiasm for AMD data center GPUs, but NVIDIA reacts aggressively to defend their turf with very good products and dilute the opportunity, and 3) our price assumptions for MI300 was that it would come at a significant discount to the A100 points of about $9k. Through conversations with several industry contacts - and to be clear, none of this is coming from AMD management, who has yet to size the opportunity - we are becoming more optimistic on all three fronts.  We continue to hear about more aggressive investment in both training and inference, and our initial numbers were likely too low, as we have discussed recently. While initially we had heard about LLM inference still heavily using (PUs, that appears to be only the case for select low latency applications - which are significant. If there is no urgency for results, CPUs are fine, but for LLM it's clear that hitting the latency requirements needs GPUs or specialty silicon. In terms of AMD's share of that opportunity, it seems more tangible and durable than our initial expectations, with solid revenue forecasts from two of the four  US hyperscalers - with prospects for a third - at unit levels that materially surprised us. We would still expect NVIDIA to be aggressive in defending its turf, but AMD is seeing solid orders from these customers‚Ä¶‚Äù  https://twitter.com/fundam_inv/status/1656747330216005632?s=46&amp;t=EfdUOH7OfS4lpc8-o1U6Dg,;,; 2023-05-11 22:49:30]

[ATH | Leverage | Index Funds and more,;,; I got a few questions as a newbie  &amp;#x200B;  1. Some of the companies I want to invest long-term are either at their ATH or close to ATH, like Microsoft  or Nvidia. I'm wondering whether I should wait for it to drop, because most of the stock market is green this year, so I have a feeling it may drop since it grew so much, what do you think? Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy 2. Index funds - the legendary S&amp;P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? 3. Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow?  4. Stock Math  - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back? Logically the first answer, but something doesn't give me a peace of mind here, so I prefer to ask 5. Eli Lilly - what do you think about this stock? Growed massive amount lately, and pharmaceutical industry will definitely be there in 5 or 10 years.,;,; 2023-11-06 14:09:30]

[4 Tech stocks benefiting from the AI boom.,;,; The world of artificial intelligence (AI) these days is overwhelmingly dominated by discussions on generative AI and its implications. Simply put, generative AI is a form of machine learning through which AI software can produce text, video, images, and more. Basically, generative AI can produce any form of content on the basis of prompts. This form of AI became more widespread and renowned after the launch of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, which revolutionized the AI sector while pulling in major tech companies to become part of the AI race.        This form of AI and its impact on the markets was discussed by Jim Stewart, a New York Times columnist, on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on June 16. According to Stewart, big tech companies, especially those that are AI beneficiaries, have been leading the recent stock market rally. These include companies such as Microsoft Corporation ($MSFT), Alphabet Inc. ($GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA). Stewart claimed that he was bullish on AI, especially considering the fact that this technology could boost productivity gains across different fields, including journalism.        **AI and the US Stock Market**    In May, NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) joined the group of companies with valuations in trillions of dollars. Many financial professionals today are attributing the gains of the S&amp;P 500 to AI, primarily, with the focus being on NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) and other big tech companies that have begun incorporating AI and generative AI in their products and services.        This overwhelming focus on a select few number of companies that can successfully play the AI boom and come out victorious has led to many investors worrying that the stock market in 2023 will turn into a selection of a few winners and a lot more losers. The S&amp;P 500 has "basically been the S&amp;P 7," a reference to the fact that only seven major tech companies have been calling the shots so far in 2023, leading the market to heavily rely on them and their gains.        **"You Are At The Starting Line Of AI"**    This reality has led many professionals and corporations to realize that the AI boom is very real and may be here to stay. Companies today will be bound to figure out where they stand in this environment and how they can integrate AI into their business models to reap the benefits of this technological revolution. NVIDIA Corporation's ($NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, in an address at the National Taiwan University in May, stated that we are currently at "the starting line of AI" and that at this moment, we should run instead of walking. The implications of his statement are many, but perhaps the most obvious lesson to take away from Huang's speech is that companies and individuals today shouldn't be slow to join the AI race - they should try their best to become part of it and ensure they don't end up getting left behind by their competitors.        Keeping the above-mentioned market dynamics and developments in mind, I have compiled a list of the top tech stocks to consider investing in to play the AI boom. I included the obvious stock picks because of their contributions to this industry so far, but I also attempted to find other companies that wouldn't be the first to come to your mind when looking at AI beneficiaries today.   # Our Methodology    To select our stocks, I  looked at which companies analysts are expecting to benefit from the AI boom and shortlisted them based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter of 2023. The stocks are ranked based on this metric, from the lowest to the highest number of hedge funds long each of them.  # Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom      **1. Oracle Corporation ($ORCL)**       On June 13, Keith Bachman at BMO Capital raised his price target on Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) from $96 to $132. The analyst also holds a Market Perform rating on the stock.        Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) is an information technology company based in Austin, Texas. The company's products and services address enterprise information technology environments across the world.        I saw 67 hedge funds long Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $2.9 billion.        TD Cowen's John Blackledge expects Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) to benefit from the current AI boom because its cloud-computing platform can offer it some competitive advantages.        First Eagle Investment Management held 20.7 million shares in Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) at the end of the first quarter, making it the largest shareholder in the company.  **2. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD)**        CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) is an information technology company offering cybersecurity products and services. It is based in Austin, Texas.        There were 72 hedge funds holding stakes in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) at the end of the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $2.4 billion.        CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) may be an interesting stock pick to play the AI boom considering the company has recently announced new AI-powered indicators of attack (IoA) models. These models can combat advanced adversary tradecraft by using machine intelligence to stop breaches.        Tal Liani at Bank of America holds a Buy rating on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) shares as of June 16. The analyst also raised the firm's price target on the stock from $162 to $190.  **3. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD)**        Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) was spotted in the portfolios of 91 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $4.9 billion.        Based in Santa Clara, California, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) is a semiconductor company that operates globally.        Joseph Moore, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, raised his price target on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) shares on June 16 from $97 to $138. The analyst also holds an Overweight rating on the shares.        Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) is a chipmaker that TD Cowen's John Blackledge has picked as one of his tech stocks to play the AI boom. This is unsurprising considering the fact that this June, the company revealed its new AI chip in its race with NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA). The new MI300X chip was described by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) as "the world's most advances accelerator for generative AI."        Citadel Investment Group held 13.9 million shares in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) at the end of the first quarter, making the fund the most prominent shareholder in the company for that quarter.  **4. Adobe Inc. ($ADBE)**        Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) is a diversified software and information technology company based in San Jose, California. The company's flagship product is its Creative Cloud, a subscription service offering members access to its creative products.        John Blackledge at TD Cowen sees Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) as a smart AI play because the company has begun rolling out new generative-AI content creation tools.        An Outperform rating was reiterated on Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) shares on June 16 by Kirk Materne at Evercore ISI. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $475 to $590.        A total of 99 hedge funds were long Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $7.3 billion.  **4. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)**        Apple Inc. ($AAPL) may not be the first big tech company that comes to your mind when looking for AI plays, but with the company's new Vision Pro headset, some believe it may be getting involved in the machine learning space more than before.        Analysts at Bernstein hold a Market Perform rating and a $175 price target on Apple Inc. ($AAPL) shares as of June 14.        Our hedge fund data for the first quarter shows 131 hedge funds long Apple Inc. ($AAPL). Their total stake value was $165 billion.        Holding 915.6 million shares in the company, Berkshire Hathaway was the largest stakeholder in Apple Inc. ($AAPL) at the end of the first quarter.,;,; 2023-06-21 06:45:44]
[Prediction thread from the start of 2023 - a shining example of how bad people are at predicting the future,;,; [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zxbjuf/what\_are\_your\_predictions\_for\_2023/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/zxbjuf/what_are_your_predictions_for_2023/)  The *overwhelming sentiment* was more pain in 2023, with the market starting to recover in late 2023. The sentiment for Q1 was pretty much unanimously negative. From what I can see, pretty much ZERO people predicted a strong rally in Q1/Q2.  People who predicted any kind of positive gains in 2023 were downvoted (sort by controversial).  **Today, after 6 months, SPY is up +16% and QQQ is up a staggering +40%.**  I hope this helps to demonstrate how difficult it is to predict the market (and yet people do it with such confidence every day, just look at the prediction thread). Take everything you read on this sub with a massive grain of salt.  NOBODY knows what the market will do next. The people who get hurt the most in the market are the ones who believe they do.  Investing is one of those strange things where the more research you do and the more trades you make, the worse you tend to do.  Women tend to outperform men simply because they are more likely to just buy and hold.  In fact, in one study the demographic that performed the best was those who had passed away, since they were unable to make any trades.  The sooner that you realize how difficult it is to time the market successfully, the better your performance will be.  As always, I recommend a DCA strategy into market ETF's and hold long term.  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-07-07 18:29:19]

They also cut their dividend, which is good to offset some of these problems but this means even LESS returns for investors.

Just curious how other investors decide on which stocks to pick? For example, I saw that QQQ, VTI, VOO, &amp; IVV all have done about 10% per year, the last 10 years, and since they're index funds, figured they'd be somewhat safe) but then saw some like Apple, Microsoft, &amp; Nvidia have done up to 27% per year for the last 10 years and want to make the most of my money so I can retire someday (currently 29 years old)  Additional Info: Grew up poor, with next to no financial education and just trying to learn so I can have a good financial future, and pretty much just try to self educate with Google and YouTube (like Graham Stephan, Andrei Jikh, etc).

[Taiwan Semiconductor is a screaming buy,;,; Taiwan Semiconductor is trading at a P/E ratio of 15. ASML, a similarly important semiconductor company who is also the global leader in its respective field commands a P/E of 37. Nvidia, and AMD also trade at far higher multiples despite being largely dependent on TSM for chips.  The reason TSM is so cheap compared to these other companies is because of the geopolitical risks associated with investing in a Taiwanese company. However, this risk is way overstated on many levels.  #1. China invading Taiwan is nowhere near a certainty. #2. TSM is building manufacturing plants outside of Taiwan including in Arizona. #3. Most importantly if China were to invade Taiwan, the entire stock market would drop off a cliff. US involvement and concerns over nuclear war would hit all non military stocks.   In that situation TSM probably falls like 70% but the rest of the market may drop by 30%. Buying a company trading at half its market value is entirely worth it if the biggest risk is that it would lose an extra 40% in value in the event of WW3 starting.   I don‚Äôt know about y‚Äôall, but I‚Äôd be more worried about getting drafted then I would about my portfolio underperforming the market.  Investing in TSM is like getting 2/1 odds that WW3 won‚Äôt happen in the next 10 years.  If you win you double your money. If you lose, the money is the least of your concerns.,;,; 2023-05-22 07:18:44]
[I may be stupid...,;,; but I was just wondering why people don't just hold shares of a company for 5 to 10 minutes, and trade when they earn a 2% profit.   If someone with 100 dollars do that 1 time a day, in a year, they would earn 137000 dollars.  Now, I understand that it is extremely difficult to do that perfectly, because stocks would rise and fall. But some shares are really volatile, so....  Actually, I don't know what I'm saying or doing. I just thought of it last night and thought it would be interesting if someone could do that.  Edit: So after I read many of the Redditor's comments, I realized I left out a key piece: doing it on a large scale. So  one would invest in many different company's stocks. Once a share price drops, they would sell it at minimal losses. But with so many stocks, there is a good chance at least one would rise, so they could sell it at a higher price and potentially earn a profit.  Thanks to you all as well! I do not trade stocks at all and I do not know much at all about them. I was just wondering about that and this was the first place I thought to ask.,;,; 2023-10-27 02:23:02]
[Microsoft-Activision deal moves closer as judge denies FTC injunction request,;,; [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/microsoft-activision-deal-moves-closer-as-judge-denies-ftc-injunction.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/11/microsoft-activision-deal-moves-closer-as-judge-denies-ftc-injunction.html)  A federal judge in San Francisco has denied the Federal Trade Commission‚Äôs motion for a preliminary injunction to stop Microsoft from completing acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard.        ‚ÄúThis Court‚Äôs responsibility in this case is narrow. It is to decide if, notwithstanding these current circumstances, the merger should be halted‚Äîperhaps even terminated‚Äîpending resolution of the FTC administrative action,‚Äù Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley wrote in her decision, published on Tuesday. ‚ÄúFor the reasons explained, the Court finds the FTC has not shown a likelihood it will prevail on its claim this particular vertical merger in this specific industry may substantially lessen competition. To the contrary, the record evidence points to more consumer access to Call of Duty and other Activision content. The motion for a preliminary injunction is therefore DENIED.‚Äù        The decision comes after five days of court hearings to assess whether Microsoft     would be able to complete the $68.7 billion Activision Blizzard     acquisition it announced in 2022. The judge was deciding whether to grant the FTC‚Äôs request for an emergency injunction to prevent the deal from closing.        The FTC argued Microsoft has shown an interest in making some games exclusive, to prevent them from appearing on Sony‚Äôs PlayStation or Nintendo‚Äôs Switch, and might do that if the deal were to close, while Microsoft said they would want to make Activision‚Äôs title more available, not less, partly to grow from people subscribing to its Game Pass library of games. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick both testified, as did executives from Alphabet, Nvidia and Sony.        In December the Federal Trade Commission filed suit to block the deal and have an administrative law judge at the agency assess it. But in June, before that could happen, the FTC requested a preliminary injunction to prevent Microsoft from completing the acquisition, with an eye toward bringing the case to its administrative law judge on Aug. 2. The two companies were looking to close the deal by July 18.        Kotick said during the hearings that the Activision Blizzard board didn‚Äôt see how the deal could continue if the judge were to grant the preliminary injunction.,;,; 2023-07-11 15:10:02]
[Analyzing a Company's Potential for Rapid Expansion: #RBLX - A Glimpse into the Metaverse,;,; I have a clear vision of the Metaverse world and its immense potential for the future. My focus is on identifying stocks that have the capacity to shape and embody this vision. Initially, I invested in AMD back in 2016, primarily because it was more affordable compared to Intel, and I happened to get lucky. In 2018, I added NVIDIA to my portfolio as I had a deep interest in gaming and GPU/computer building. In 2020, I purchased an Oculus device, which allowed me to glimpse into an untapped future. Interestingly, Facebook, now META, has emerged as a dominant player in this space. It's possible that they will enjoy several years of success, much like Intel did in 2016.        Recently, I discovered Roblox, a company that shares my vision and embodies how I envision the true metaverse operating. They have a long road ahead, but with the right talent within the company, they have the potential to achieve their goals. Patience will be crucial since the key lies in retaining their user base into adulthood rather than solely targeting adults at present. This journey will undoubtedly take years. Furthermore, their success is reliant on partnerships with NVIDIA and other hardware manufacturers who can provide the necessary technology. I believe Roblox could be the interface we rely on as AI progresses and 3D/VR technology becomes more advanced.        Considering all this, I seek advice on whether to invest in this company now or wait for future developments, especially if I anticipate Roblox to resemble the fictional 'Innovative Online Industries' from the book Ready Player One. While there seems to be a collective vision for the future, the uncertainty lies in identifying the company that can bring it to life. What are your thoughts on this matter?,;,; 2023-05-27 05:16:02]

[Morgan Stanley Sees Dojo Boosting TSLA Value by $500 Billion,;,; Headline comes from Bloomberg [(yahoo link)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-surge-thanks-dojo-supercomputer-032644640.html)  TSLA is up nearly 10% today.  Morgan Stanley's upgrade of TSLA was a target of $400, up from $250.  Excerpt from the article:  &gt; Tesla has been mentioning how Dojo gives it an edge in AI and self-driving technology since at least 2021. In July this year, CEO Elon Musk told investors that the carmaker plans to invest more than $1 billion on the project by the end of 2024.  &gt; ‚ÄúAs a point of reference, in 2022, Nvidia spent $7 billion across the entire company on research and development,‚Äù Gene Munster, co-founder and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, wrote in a note in July. ‚ÄúIn other words, spending $1 billion plus on a single product is aggressive and speaks to Musk‚Äôs urgency at making good on this FSD prediction.‚Äù  &gt; Seth Goldstein of Morningstar Research Services LLC says that, ‚Äúwhile it‚Äôs good for Elon to push the team to go as quickly as possible, in reality Tesla usually sees a delay from Elon‚Äôs original timelines.‚Äù  &gt; ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt making progress,‚Äù Goldstein said in a phone interview Monday. ‚ÄúOnce Dojo is up and running and takes over the software training, it will allow Tesla to update software more quickly and increase subscriptions at software margins, which can be a big value driver.‚Äù,;,; 2023-09-11 18:14:43]

[I am a cynical pessimist. How do I ever get to buy a hype?,;,; The thing is: I am somewhat knowledgeable in the IT / AI field and chose that field as my investment "playground". When looking at trends, I tend to have a cynical, pessimistic outlook which, on a technical level, has generally proven to be correct in the past. However, the stock market ignores all this nice technical expertise and trades unfounded expectations and hype -- and I never buy into the hype and look at all those green numbers on my watchlist only.  Some examples: I looked at NVIDIA when the crypto mining hype was on, with a background in high performance computing, and figured their GPUs were not energy efficient enough and this was quite obviously a task for ASICs, which proved correct in hindsight. I decided to stay out of what I considered an unfounded hype -- and missed out on the first big jump.   I also looked at AI and big data-based predictive analysis and maintenance, back before the \*GPT hype, and with connections to high energy physicists who run serious big data analyses decided that that was not a good fit for typical industry data. Almost no one apart from perhaps the big cloud operators has enough raw data in their enterprise to do meaningful statistical analyses. From what I hear, this is also technically correct as many companies silently ditch their hopes to be able to do predictive maintenance now -- but I obviously missed out on that hype as well.  Can you give me some advice on adjusting my way of looking at the market? I find "don't worry about the technical realities, the finance people won't understand anyway and just buy the shiny new stuff" a bit too simplistic and cynical... What's a good balance between knowledge of a field and following the herd into the green numbers?,;,; 2024-02-09 07:13:27]
[Foreign Investors Sold $9.8B of Chinese Stocks this Month,;,; [https://tokenist.com/foreign-investors-sold-9-8b-of-chinese-stocks-this-month/](https://tokenist.com/foreign-investors-sold-9-8b-of-chinese-stocks-this-month/)     In August 2023, foreign investors set a new record by divesting $9.8 billion in Chinese stocks, driven by escalating concerns over China's crumbling property market. This historic monthly sell-off highlights the crisis's impact on the local stock market, with offloaded stocks totaling 71.6 billion yuan ($9.8 billion), the highest since the mainland-Hong Kong stock trading link began in 2014.        Despite mainland institutional investors expressing interest in Chinese stocks, the market continues to struggle. While foreign investors hold under 10% of A-shares by market cap, their preference for top-weighted stocks in the CSI 300 index grants them substantial influence. Although the index increased 0.72% to 3,723, it remains down over 7% since July.        Rooted in China's property turmoil, responsible for a quarter of its economy, the sell-off follows Evergrande's bankruptcy protection filing due to a colossal debt exceeding $300 billion. As the property and broader economic concerns meld, experts caution that factors like tight loan conditions and muted consumer spending amplify the risk of an impending global recession.,;,; 2023-08-24 13:48:00]

[is it too late to put vti types in roth at my age?,;,; I'm 54. I have $10k to invest right now. I am going to be putting 8k into my roth but want to buy some stocks in the roth with it. I was looking to get something like vti or one of those. But, is that a bad decision if I'm planning on retiring in 6-8 yrs. I live a very minimal lifestyle. But, I was bad with money in my younger years and have been much better in my last few decades. I always try to buy winter beaters for cars (live in NY). I have a 1000sq ft house which I think is too big for me alone, but oh well. It's paid for. I can put a decent amount of my paycheck away every week. I make about 70-80k per year with the ability to make over 100k, but I dont want to cause it's too many hours to put in (blue collar). I'm not married and have no expenses besides the usual taxes, food, etc. I have a 401k through my employer with fidelity. It is one of those 2030 (not sure of the number )plans where they manage it. I also have some individual stocks that I "gamble" with and am doing ok. I am planning on putting 8k into my roth and being done with that for the year. But, i want to get some stocks with that so the money isnt just sitting there. So , is vti or one of those a good choice? I have nvidia, apple, palintir, amd and some other small ones. Not sure what I will do with the other $2k. Thanks,;,; 2024-01-04 16:41:18]
[Long Jim Cramer ETF Shutters After Luring in Just $1.3 Million,;,; (Bloomberg) -- An exchange-traded fund that aimed to track CNBC anchor Jim Cramer‚Äôs stock picks is planning to shutter just five months after launching.  The Long Cramer Tracker ETF (ticker LJIM) will stop trading Sept. 11, according to a press release Monday. The fund, which buys stocks recommended by the host of CNBC‚Äôs Mad Money show, has only managed to attract $1.3 million in assets amid gains of just 2.2% since its debut in March.  Tuttle Capital Management chief executive Matt Tuttle launched LJIM alongside the $3.4 million Inverse Cramer Tracker ETF (SJIM), which bets against Cramer‚Äôs stock calls and will continue to trade. While LJIM has actually outperformed its bearish Cramer counterpart, Tuttle says he is shutting the fund after failing to attract the attention of the CNBC host.   ‚ÄúWe started LJIM in order to facilitate a conversation with Jim Cramer around his stock picks as the other side to the Short Cramer ETF,‚Äù Tuttle said in the press release. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, Mr. Cramer and CNBC have been unwilling to engage in dialogue and instead have chosen to ignore the funds, therefore there is no reason to keep the long side going. Going forward we will just focus on the short side.‚Äù  A CNBC spokesperson didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment.  Despite a slide in August, LJIM has gained about 2.2% on a total return basis since inception, with Nvidia Corp., Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Oracle Corp. among its biggest holdings. SJIM, which also short-sells Cramer‚Äôs picks in addition to buying companies he recommends against, has dropped 4.4% over that span.   Tuttle told Bloomberg‚Äôs Trillions podcast in March that he and two colleagues monitor Cramer‚Äôs television appearances and social media accounts to put together the fund‚Äôs actively managed portfolios, which charge 1.2%. A CNBC spokesperson said at the time that Cramer encourages long-term investing through ‚Äúa balanced portfolio that includes index funds and individual stocks.‚Äù  Tuttle is behind some of the $7.4 trillion ETF industry‚Äôs more infamous products. In addition to the Cramer funds, he‚Äôs also behind the $240 million AXS Short Innovation Daily ETF (SARK), which wagers against Cathie Wood‚Äôs flagship fund  https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/long-jim-cramer-etf-shutters-after-luring-in-just-1-3-million-1.1961839,;,; 2023-08-22 01:01:08]

[Question On Trailing Stop Limits,;,; Bear with me as I‚Äôm a simple trader and really put most my money into 401K and a target date fund, but my Roth IRA is my play account.

Good example being Nvidia. Their growth recently is crazy from the AI hype, and I‚Äôm up way over 20% on them, so instead of gamble missing out on more upside by taking gains now, wouldn‚Äôt it make sense to just set a trailing stop if like 10-12% and let it play out?

[ASTS holders - What are your plans now?,;,; It still hurts to revisit that stock was diluted again on June 28th, at a price 30% lower than the last day's price around $6.5. While their technology is making progress (there is still lots to go), funding continues to be the main concern for them.  Personally, I'm still holding with average cost of $5.4, but to be honest the last dilution kind of screamed desperation in my opinion, considering their previous dilution before this one was on December 2022, at a lesser discount of 15%.   I'd be lying if my thesis still remains the same before purchase, but curious to see what others are thinking. Not trying to trigger a bearish post about the company, I'm generally curious.,;,; 2023-07-17 18:06:08]
[As Americans shop, stocks see another weekly win,;,; &amp;#x200B;  In a holiday-shortened day of trading, U.S. stocks showed a mixed performance, but the major indices ended the week on a positive note. Analysts are optimistic about the last five weeks of trading in 2023, expecting holiday sales to boost retailers, while the technology sector remains strong and energy prices ease. The Dow Jones gained 0.3%, the S&amp;P 500 added 2.7 points, and the Nasdaq slipped 15 points. For the week, the Dow was up 1.3%, the S&amp;P 500 added 1%, and the Nasdaq rose 0.9%. Notable stock movements include Johnson &amp; Johnson leading Dow winners, while Apple, Nike, and Microsoft were in the red. Nvidia, a Nasdaq-100 stock, was the biggest loser.        Retail stocks generally rose, with the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF gaining 0.7%. Interest rates edged up, and oil prices declined. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 rose 0.28% despite concerns about Germany's economic contraction, while in Asia, the MSCI ex-Japan benchmark fell 0.8%, influenced by a pullback in Chinese markets. The Nikkei 225 closed at a four-month high.

["Is the AI-led 'F*cking Baby Bubble' Bursting? BofA Says Tech Stocks Just Saw Their Biggest Outflow in 10 Weeks.",;,; The current AI-led "baby bubble" could be seen as a positive or a negative depending on the perspective. On the one hand, it is a sign of progress and innovation, with technology giants such as Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla leading the way. The stock prices of these companies have boomed this year, suggesting that investors are bullish on the future of AI.  On the other hand, there are some who are warning that the investor hype for AI could be short-lived and that the market could be heading for a significant correction. Bank of America's Michael Hartnett has compared the current AI boom to the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s, where the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 78%. UBS's Art Cashin and veteran economist David Rosenberg have also drawn parallels with the dot-com bubble.  Ultimately, it is difficult to know for sure whether the AI-led "baby bubble" will burst or if it will continue to grow and drive the stock market higher. It is important to remember that, while AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, it is still a relatively new technology and there is a lot of uncertainty and risk associated with investing in AI-related stocks. As such, it is important for investors to do their due diligence and be aware of the potential downsides before investing in AI stocks.  (https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-led-baby-bubble-bursting-020103566.html)  What lessons can be learned from the dot-com bubble that could be applied to the current AI stock boom?,;,; 2023-06-24 03:11:03]
[How US stocks rose 20% from their lows, and where they might be going,;,; U.S. stocks have defied fears of a recession, a banking crisis and soaring Treasury yields to rise 20% from their October lows - one definition of a bull market.        The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index closed at a low of 3,577.03 on Oct. 12, 2022, down 25% from its all-time high after the Federal Reserve unleashed a series of bruising interest rate increases to fight decades-high inflation.        On Thursday, it closed up 0.6% at 4,293.93, amid growing optimism over the economic outlook and a rate hiking cycle that appears to be nearing its end. Here are some features of the index's rally, and a look at where stocks might go from here.  While markets seldom rise in a straight line, the S&amp;P 500's journey from the bottom took 164 days - the longest 20% climb from a bear market low in five decades. Among the factors holding stocks back was a surge in Treasury yields to their highest levels in decades that dulled the allure of equities by offering investors the potential to earn attractive income in government-backed bonds.        A crisis that saw the biggest bank busts since the Great Recession also shook investor confidence, as did worries over a potentially catastrophic fight over lifting the U.S. debt ceiling.  The narrow breadth of the S&amp;P 500's rally has been a concern for some investors, with just seven stocks - Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) - responsible for almost all of the index's gains this year. Many investors view these stocks as safe bets in uncertain times. Their gains were also driven by excitement over advances in artificial intelligence.  More recently, however, the market's gains have shown tentative signs of broadening out to other stocks.  Meanwhile, volatility has subsided - not only in stocks, but in Treasuries and currencies.        One reason for the calm in markets is investors' belief that the Fed is unlikely to deliver many more of the rate hikes that shook asset prices last year.        Investors have also been encouraged by evidence showing that the U.S. economy continues to be resilient in the face of the central bank's monetary tightening, while inflation slowly cools. The U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (.CESIUSD) shows U.S. economic data has in aggregate topped market expectations, helped by stronger than expected numbers for employment and consumer spending.        A 20% gain from bear market lows has in the past heralded further upside for stocks.  In four of the last six bear markets, the S&amp;P went on to rise 20% or more in the six months after hitting this milestone.  [https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/how-us-stocks-rose-20-their-lows-where-they-might-be-going-2023-06-09/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/how-us-stocks-rose-20-their-lows-where-they-might-be-going-2023-06-09/)  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-06-09 09:07:00]
[Microsoft stock hits a record high. Why its next move might be lower,;,; Microsoft stock reached a new all-time closing high‚Äîbut there could be some hiccups ahead in the short term.        Microsoft's stock rose 1.1% to $360.53 on Tuesday. That's a new closing high, topping the previous high of $359.49 set on July 18. Furthermore, Microsoft has won for eight days in a row, its longest winning streak since January 28, 2021.        The stock has been helped by the company‚Äôs strong earnings and sales, which got a boost from the Azure cloud business.        But it‚Äôs not just earnings. Microsoft was already outperforming its peers following tech weakness in August and September. Its stock has gained 15% since the end of September, outpacing Amazon.com (AMZN), which has risen 12%, Meta Platforms (META), which has risen 6.5%, Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), which is up 6%, Alphabet (GOOGL) which has ticked up 0.3%, and Tesla (TSLA), which has dropped 13%.        So, why be concerned? It all comes down to the 14-day relative strength index from Microsoft. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a measure of a stock's or index's momentum, or lack thereof. The closer it comes to 20 on the negative, the more oversold it is, while a score close to 80 indicates that the stock is extremely overbought. A value below 30 usually indicates that a stock is about to rally, while a score above 60 indicates a likely decline. Microsoft's RSI is at 72.75, indicating that it is becoming quite overbought and that a pullback is possible.        That doesn‚Äôt mean Microsoft isn‚Äôt worth buying for its long-term potential. The company has a lot to recommend, including a cloud business that should get a boost as ChatGPT, which held its developer conference yesterday, looks to expand. It just means that investors might get a better opportunity to pick up shares in the days ahead.        ,;,; 2023-11-08 11:35:51]
[Which industry will benefit the most with cost savings due to AI advancements? Insurance?,;,; When we think about investing in AI, we usually tend to think about companies like Google that own DeepMind, or companies like Microsoft that have a stake in OpenAI. We think about Nvidia as a hardware player.  It's fine to invest in these companies, because if AI takes off huge, they'll all reap tremendous rewards, but what about the companies that will use these new AI tools to eliminate huge swaths of their payroll? I think we should concentrate on companies that can continue to do everything that their business model is aligned to do, just with 70 percent less human employees. The gigantic cost savings will start showing up in their surprising earnings beats, and the valuations for these companies will start to accelerate.   So, which industry uses thousands of human workers to process forms and documents, that won't need any of these workers anymore once AI has completely automated their process? The first industry that popped into my mind is Insurance. Should we look for insurance companies with the largest number of current workers likely to be phased out?  Look, I know this is depressing, but what else are we going to do? If we're all going to have our jobs replaced, might as well get rich investing in these companies on the way out. I don't want to come across as a vulture that's just following a group of travelers in the Sahara desert, just waiting for them to drop dead so they can feast, but it is.... what it is.,;,; 2023-04-21 16:34:39]
[Medical Properties Trust - Whatcha think?,;,;    Hi all  I'm not here to shit on anything. But I use to trade options on MPW. There were a few things that were yellow flags for me. Yellow flags meaning they might be issues or could indicate issues but alone are not enough to disqualify MPW for me.  1. High premium usually indicates high risk. REITS that I have looked at usually have option premium more like a value stock. But MPW has premium rivaling Tesla and Nvidia. 2. High dividends are concerns for several reasons. The biggest concern is fundamentals of the company. Another is a possible dividend cut. 3. MPW recently wrote down a pretty substantial amount of money from one of their tenants going into bankruptcy. This was given in their last earnings report/call. This would explain the drop in share price in the last couple weeks.  Then I came across some things online. The info to me turns those yellow flags into big red flags.

[Seeking Advice on Reallocating Tech Stock Profits to IRA: Long-Term Gains vs. Retirement Planning,;,;   Hey fellow investors,  I've been holding onto tech stocks like Nvidia, Netflix Amazon, Apple, and a few others since 2017, and they've seen impressive returns ranging from 100% to over 1,000%. Currently, I have around $65,000 invested in these stocks on Robinhood.  Considering the incredible gains over the past seven to eight years, I'm contemplating whether it makes sense to sell some of these long-term holdings and redirect the profits into my IRA accounts. My IRAs have a balance of approximately $72,000, and this year, I lack the additional income to contribute to my retirement accounts.  The idea is to potentially diversify by moving some gains from individual tech stocks into more traditional investment vehicles, such as a target retirement fund, total stock market index fund or an S&amp;P 500 tracking fund within my IRA.  I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences on whether reallocating profits from high-performing tech stocks to retirement accounts is a prudent move, considering the current market conditions and the long-term benefits of retirement planning.  For some more context, I'm a 34 year old male with no major debt, I own a house with mortgage payments of about $1600 a month and about 190k in homeowners equity, and I have no car or student loan payments.  Some of my long term tech holdings are as follows:  NVDA - $28,000, 1300% return;  AMZN - $9,000, 137% return;  NFLX - $6,200, 220% return;  AAPL - $14,000, 340% return   I have some more small tech holdings totaling the rest.

[Massive Misconception About the Writers Strike,;,; What most people do not realize is that the majority of the major studies are owned by larger entities that do not suffer from this. Sure its small term pain knowing that certain projects are on hold. There is a lot of content in the coffers that they can still continue to produce without additional writing.  Most of the major studios also have other revenue streams that power them through. Let's just take Disney to start. They have $8.3B coming in from parks. They have $5.5B coming in from Streaming. They have 1.9 Billion coming in from cord deals.  Look at Comcast, they have Peacock streamers, they have their existing cable business, they have their internet business (mixed with cable subscribers), they have their mobile unit.. they have plenty to keep powering their way through.  Then you have weird companies like Apple and Amazon who can take virtual losses forever in entertainment and not care. Netflix is weird because of all its custom content but has a massive catalog of back content to keep subscribers happy for a while.  &amp;#x200B;  What stocks to look at are the ones that rely only on content to stay alive. Those are the companies to be paying attention too. For instance I'd be very interested in how Warner Bro's/Discovery are going to be doing.  I'd also look at Sony who owes a lot to their entertainment divisions for profits (sure they do electronics and niche other areas), but they own some of the larger studios.  &amp;#x200B;  I also don't want to make this a political topic but the Writers guild really needs to re-think their leverage. Sure the major studio's wont have new content coming out and already put a massive backlog and delays to projects. The major studios now are conglomerates that own so many other businesses they can keep moving along. They also don't realize that these studios will keep generating revenue but don't have to pay any of the writers, actors, production, etc... they have a freeze on money coming in but also a freeze on money going out.  The problem with industry consolidation + multi-faceted businesses is you lose your negotiating leverage.  &amp;#x200B;  Would love to hear other peoples thoughts on this. What do you think?  &amp;#x200B;  Especially their fear of AI As they know will becoming after their jobs. Netflix already was using it to determine what  shows and themes would be the most productive for returns. Disney/ILM started using it to replace opening credits. Disney even hired the group that for the end of Mando Season 2 were Luke showed up, another group of people showed they could do a better Deep Fake and they hired them. If I'm not mistaken Netflix used AI to write one of black mirrors episodes.  AI is coming and I can see why writers are so fearful. People are so naive on the idea that AI is coming for jobs even creative.  &amp;#x200B;  If anything I'd love to hear from people some of the VFX studios if they are public? That would be were I would start putting money into. Ones that are progressive and have a massive catalogue. It sucks ILM is private (Disney owned), Pixar (Disney Owned), Dreamworks, etc.  &amp;#x200B;  I wish Epic which powers the majority of games but also the Volume that is used in almost all new TV productions.... was public but they are private for now.  &amp;#x200B;  **At the end of the day the stocks to pay attention to are:**  The Chips Needed to Make these: Intel, Nvidia, AMD  The Fabs that produce them: TSCM, Samsung, Intel  Then there are companies producing the software: Epic, Blender, Unity. Adobe  The Streaming Services: Netflix, Disney+, Max (Warner Bros) -- then you have youtube material being turned into its own streaming service like Curiositystream Inc.

[Intel - not overvalued amid this euphoric market,;,; Let's summarize the reasons why INTC is at the current price:  * \- Lagging behind in technology * \- Poor track record of management * \- In the middle of a pivotal moment in their history * \- Losing market share in most segments * \- Record low profits amid market saturation and supply chain issues * \- Their AI portfolio misses most of the AI golden rush * \- Alternative architecture ARM is customizable and this spiked in demand these days  &amp;#x200B;  Still, let's underline some facts:  **Market valuation landscape:**  * \- Up in the value chain, the only competitor is AMD. AMD is 5 times smaller in size, yet has bigger market cap. And remember AMD outsources its fabs, with this info alone you can estimate that the apples-to-apples difference in valuation is 25-fold. * \- In the fab front, TSMC is valued 5 times higher than Intel. For reference it has 40% less employees.  **Strategy:**  Currently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully:  * \- Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC) * \- Catching up to TSMC's tech  They have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking.  Everything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn't worry too much.  &amp;#x200B;  **Management:**  The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike.  If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.  We already have positive things to say about their execution:  * \- They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do. * \- They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join. * \- 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards. * \- I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes.  &amp;#x200B;  **Irrational fears:**  * \- The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share:  Hey, it's one thing to believe that catching up is gonna make the parity even, and it's a completely different thing to defend that AMD has some kind of superpower or INTC an unforgiveable defficiency that will lead to an uneven outcome over the long term. 50-50 seems natural.  * \- Intel performance disappointed me / I had losses with this stock:  Relatable, but it's not wise to make decisions on these terms.  &amp;#x200B;  Ngl, this is a long game, but it doesn't look like a bad starting position, especially if we consider the already saturated alternatives.  &amp;#x200B;  EDIT: Thank you for your points of view, they give me more to think about. After all, my goal is to make the most fair case and orient my thoughts, as I see no good or current publication about this.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-07-29 15:16:15]
[IonQ Pursues a Revolutionary Step in AI: Striving to Develop Quantum Machine Learning Models Matching Human Cognitive Abilities,;,;    IonQ, a quantum computing company, is aiming to pioneer Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models that can rival the capabilities of human intelligence. The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.   In terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities. Their next major technical milestone is achieving 35 algorithmic qubits (AQ) which, beyond this point, will make it more cost-effective to run models on actual quantum machines than simulating them classically. IonQ also collaborates with leading tech companies like Amazon, Dell, Microsoft, and NVIDIA to integrate their quantum technology with the partners' AI and machine learning expertise.   Further, IonQ is venturing into Quantum Artificial Intelligence and has already published research on modeling human cognition. This field of study employs quantum computers to simulate human cognition, potentially offering powerful insights into artificial general intelligence (AGI).  &amp;#x200B;  Source: https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2023/06/02/a-quantum-leap-in-ai-ionq-aims-to-create-quantum-machine-learning-models-at-the-level-of-general-human-intelligence/?sh=31c398187b88,;,; 2023-06-03 08:15:36]
[Any reasons to not invest in tech companies?,;,; Seems to me like tech has most potential for growth: AI, robotics, nanotech, biotech, etc, will surely influence society by A LOT.

[Tesla's valuation could soar by another $150 billion thanks to the rise of the robo-taxi, RBC says,;,; * Tesla shares could jump another 19% thanks to the rise of robot-taxis, according to RBC. * That would add over $150 billion to the EV giant's total market capitalization. * Robo-taxis "could potentially transform society" and account for over 70% of Tesla's future value, analysts said.  Tesla's market capitalization could soar by over $150 billion thanks to a looming surge in demand for robo-taxis, according to RBC Capital Markets.  The self-driving taxi "could potentially transform society more than anything else in our lifetimes" and makeup over 70% of the EV giant's future value, a team of analysts led by Tom Narayan said in a note to clients Thursday.  The Canadian bank lifted its price target for Tesla's stock to $305 ‚Äì over 19% above the $255.90 shares traded at as of Thursday's close.  Those gains would add another $155 billion to Elon Musk's company's total valuation, by Insider's calculations. Tesla has already seen its market cap surge by over $270 billion in the past month after it struck deals with General Motors and Ford that would allow them access to the EV leader's charging infrastructure.  Tesla should be able to dominate the robot-taxi market given how well-developed its self-driving tech already is, according to RBC.  Narayan's team estimated that Musk's EV maker could achieve a 25% market share in the US, as well as an 8% share in Europe and a 7% share in China.  Tesla's share price is already up 107% in 2023, with the EV maker adding over $300 billion of market cap over the past month alone.  The robo-taxi is the strongest of several factors that will help the stock extend its breakneck rally, according to RBC.  Tesla's early success in its price war and the landmark deals it signed with Ford and General Motors last month could also fuel further gains, the analysts said.  They added that the stock will also benefit from the frenzy for artificial intelligence, which has helped fellow tech giant Nvidia to rack up triple-digit gains and reach a $1 trillion valuation.,;,; 2023-06-17 09:25:19]

Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 1.2%. ***** &gt; President Joe Biden and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy reached an agreement to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a default over the weekend, with Congress set to vote on the legislation as early as Wednesday. Lawmakers have not signaled that they intended to return to Capitol Hill early to work on the deal. Both Republican and Democratic support is needed for the bill agreement to pass. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúAlthough the upcoming votes in Congress still pose a small risk, the main risk had been that political pressures would prevent a deal from coming together,‚Äù wrote Goldman Sachs economists in a note. ‚ÄúNow that a deal has been reached, it seems very likely to pass both chambers of Congress in the coming week.‚Äù ***** &gt; The agreement comes just days before the so-called ‚ÄúX date‚Äù on June 5, which is the earliest date the Treasury Department has signaled the U.S. could default on debt obligations. The initial compromise was first announced on Saturday evening. ***** &gt; The long negotiations between the White House and congressional leaders raised concern among investors that a default on U.S. debt could take place. Wall Street has already contended with persistent inflation and a banking crisis this year. ***** &gt; Stocks closed higher on Friday. The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 finished last week with gains. The market was closed Monday due to Memorial Day. ***** &gt; Investors will also turn their attention to May jobs data out on Friday, while the April Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics will be released on Wednesday.

[Petco - 0.01 EPS miss, ~20% decline. Opportunity?,;,; Petco earnings released yesterday, revenue inline and an EPS miss of 0.01, doesn't seem to justify the almost 20% decline. üò≥  Stock sitting at about $8 now.  I've been watching this thing fall for 2 years. Glad I never got in   but now I'm considering a position. I suppose the danger of continuing to fall is there but I feel like this could/should be the bottom. I mean they're still a profitable company at the end of the day and they seem to be trying to move forward with their vet clinics. And if the FED starts to loosen up on the rate hikes then Petco just might have a decent path ahead of them from this point.  Anyone out there want to chime in on this?,;,; 2023-03-24 03:41:27]
[Ok seriously NVDA?,;,; The company is good. But it's not nearly profitable enough to be a $1.1T company. What on earth is driving this massive bump again this week?  Disclosure I've owned NVDA since 2015 with no intention of selling beyond what I sold after earnings to lock in massive profits. I just don't understand what's going on at all with it now.,;,; 2023-07-13 16:15:28]
[Do you think NVDA will split its stock soon?,;,; The last time they split it was in the mid $700/share ($748 I think), which it is rapidly approaching again. I know it has no real effect on the value of the company, but splits do often provide a nice bump to the stock price. Not that it needs the help going up...   What say you? Split or no? If split, what do you think, 3/1, 4/1, something else? ,;,; 2024-02-05 19:07:16]
[Why NVDA keeps going up?,;,; WTF is going on with NVDA? It keeps going up and it doesnt seem like it will stop anytime soon. I read some comments in about a couple weeks ago that many people are shorting @320 but it seems a pretty bad idea based on its trend lately. What‚Äôs your thought?,;,; 2023-05-18 18:53:50]
[NVDA: another painful lesson in selling,;,; I've said numerous times in this sub that my most painful mistake over my investing career by far has been selling prematurely. But I'm human, and I still occasionally make the same stupid mistake.  I bought NVDA a year ago at around $234. I watched in horror as it dropped to a low of almost $110, but I patiently held on. Then it started to rebound nicely late last year but I started getting concerned, hearing lots of people talk about the supply glut in chips and valuation concerns and blah, blah, blah. So I decided to cut my losses around $160. And here we are, back right to my purchase price.  Yet another painful reminder that for long term investors, the only reason to sell (unless you really need the capital) is if the thesis for making the investment in the first place no longer applies. Don't sell because of macro concerns, hypothetical risks, or because of valuation.,;,; 2023-02-23 17:06:07]
[Could NVDA go the way of Cisco?,;,; Yes, chips and AI aren't going away. But neither was the internet. People would make that argument about cisco at the dotcom. "It's just the beginning".   At almost 95 p/e ratio, is it still sensible to buy?,;,; 2024-02-11 10:59:26]
[Should I sell NVDA?,;,; I have about xxx NVDA. From vested RSU.   Should I sell some of them? If yes, how many?  Or do we think NVDA is going to increase significantly more in 5-10 years?  The rationale for selling would be to lock in the profits and invest in other stocks that might have higher chance of going up where NVDA might not have enough growth left in it in mid term.  What‚Äôs a good strategy?  Thanks!  Update: I have decided to sell about yyy of them next week unless the price drops below $zzz.  Thanks everyone for taking the time to respond. Appreciate it.  Update 2: If you are curious about my own opinion as someone in the deep learning industry for 5/6 years, my forecast is we are NOT in a bubble. The hype of AI is justified. NVDA might actually cross $500. But I still want to realize at least some profit.,;,; 2023-05-27 14:41:00]
[Nvidia(NVDA) at an All-Time High Today!,;,; Nvidia stock jumps over 6% by the end of the trading day on January 8, 2024, making one share worth $524.36. Everyone who knows something knows to keep an eye on Nvidia but it just keeps getting better and better. Being at an all-time high despite some analysts believing it could be out performed in the AI industry I still believe it is nowhere near its intrinsic value and therefore is still a good buy in my opinion. With Nvidia(NVDA) being at an all-time high what are your thoughts on this stock? Will you be buying more in 2024 despite the high price of this stock?,;,; 2024-01-08 21:41:23]
[NVDA may surpass AMZN within weeks,;,; Wild times guys. To summarize, NVDA reported super bullish guidance for coming quarters, average yearly estimate was $30B in revenue, which may now be somewhere between $40B-$50B. We will be seeing lot of upgrades from analysts in coming days. I am still puzzled as to how this was already not priced on with almost 100% run in last 6 months alone. Now stock is up another 26%.  Amazon will be doing ~$550B in revenue in 2023 alone with low teen growth next year. And their market cap is between $1T-$1.1T.  Can someone help me understand how NVDA has such a low short interest at these level? And literally everyone thinks this all makes sense? (Excluding redditors) i am talking about institutional investors, because at these level, they are the one moving the needle. And they clearly loading this up big time. At least for TSLA when it went on this insane run, there was lot of short interest, then S&amp;P 500 inclusion hype, stock split, EV demand surge and 0% interest rate.   Trying to figure out what these fund managers are seeing for bull case for NVDA.,;,; 2023-05-25 02:37:44]
[Is there potential to short NVDA?,;,; I was taking a look at the general semiconductor industry and was surprised by the metrics of NVDA. The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years.   I also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning.  I do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows. However this valuation seems obscene and reminds me a lot of NVDA before the big sell of from its former valuation at similar levels.  Seems that going short through ITM or ATM long dated puts seems legitimate. What do you guys think?   Update: I did see the +20% move after NVDA reported earnings. Luckily I did not open the short position yet. However, after briefly reading the filings I believe this could potentially be an even better short as valuation is more ridiculous,;,; 2023-05-19 04:07:33]
[Two Big Differences Between AMD &amp; NVDA,;,; I was digging deep into a lot of tech stocks on my watch lists and came across what I think are two big differences that separate AMD and NVDA from a margins perspective and a management approach.  Obviously, at the moment NVDA has superior technology and the current story for AMD's expected rise (an inevitable rise in the eyes of most) is that they'll steal future market share from NVDA. That they'll close the gap and capture billions of dollars worth of market share. Well, that might eventually happen, but I couldn't ignore these two differences during my research.   The first is margins. NVDA is rocking an astounding 42% profit margin and 57% operating margin. AMD on the other hand is looking at an abysmal .9% profit margin and 4% operating margins. Furthermore, when it comes to management, NVDA is sitting at 27% of a return on assets and 69% return on equity while AMD posts .08% return on assets and .08% return in equity. Thats an insane gap in my eyes.   Speaking to management there was another insane difference. AMD's president rakes home 6 million a year while the next highest paid person is making just 2 million. NVDA's CEO is making 1.6 million and the second highest paid employee makes 990k. That to me looks like greedy president on the AMD side versus a company that values it's second tier employees in NVDA.   I've been riding the NVDA wave for nearly a decade now and have been looking at opening a defensive position in AMD, but those margins and the CEO salary disparity I found to be alarming at the moment. Maybe if they can increase their margins it'll be a buy for me, but waiting for a pull back until then and possibly a more company friendly President.,;,; 2024-02-01 00:45:47]
[Is NVDA losing demand?,;,; From UBS today,   To address Nvidia (NVDA) GPU limitations, Oracle said they won't pursue a proprietary silicon program and will instead focus on AMD's MI300X chips, planning to launch with these chips "early next year."

[shorting NVDA,;,; I am not one to short stocks and I am aware that shorting NVDA is a very dangerous game.  &amp;#x200B;  NVDA has raised guidance so high and the stock has ran a ridiculous amount that if they don't deliver perfect earnings/guidance it is set up to drop IMO.    &amp;#x200B;  Is anyone shorting/buying puts into earnings?  ,;,; 2023-08-15 13:33:02]
[Nvidia ($NVDA) is the best risk-reward short over the next few months,;,; On a technical-level, $NVDA is absolutely ridiculous. It's valuation is on-par with it's 2021 peak when the GPU shortage was at it's peak, and it's up almost 100% YTD with its inventories ballooning. Of course, trying to short a company just because it's over-valued or overbought is a fool's errand. You'll quickly find out that great stocks can simply keep going up for months on end. That's why you need a spark, or a narrative shift to get the ball rolling for the stock to reverse.  https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-says-its-ai-supercomputer-is-faster-greener-than-nvidia-2023-04-05/  Fundamentally, $NVDA's enormous bounce has been attributed to Chat GPT and the recent AI movement. Just to be clear, I'm bullish on AI. (not $AI lol) However, up until now $NVDA's narrative has been that they will be the biggest, if not the sole, chip benefactor of the AI wave. Their A100 chip is the bread and butter for AI development while their H100 chip is the much beefier, enterprise-focused one. Don't get me wrong, the H100 is quite amazing and it's recent release will be hard to catch for some time. However, up until this point it's been thought that their lead in chips over AMD and Intel would grant them a large revenue boost over the next few years. Google's timely outperformance of the A100 is a testament that challengers are emerging. Nvidia's lead might end sooner than expected.  As we all know, once a technology trend catches on - the big tech players catch on and move quickly while deploying mountains of cash. Whether it's Apple, Microsoft, or Google - they will compete if the TAM is large enough. Whether it's Microsoft squishing out Zoom and Slack, or Apple ousting Intel CPU chips, or Google leveraging YouTube to compete against TikTok - these corporations do not hesitate to compete at any large opportunity.  I think tonight, the narrative has shifted for AI chips. I think we can all agree that big tech truly understands the dramatic paradigm shift that this AI wave will be. AI has been on the backburner for years up until Chat GPT recently proved that it's coming now. Therefore, would it be surprising that these corporations will try to develop their AI-chips in-house? Apple did it for their CPUs in their macs, thanks to TSMC. If Nvidia controlled and manufactured its own fabs then this discussion would be irrelevant. But that's not the case. Google has apparently already caught up to the A100 with their chip designs. What about Apple or Microsoft? You think they're content with continuing to dump fortunes on Nvidia chips if AI is the future? Of course they're going to develop their own chips in house as well. Hardware is key. That's been a turning point for Meta, and is a large reason they're trying to make VR work. You need to control both the hardware and the software.  tl;dr: OTM Puts on $NVDA for May or June 2023. Expect a 20-30% drop in the coming weeks.,;,; 2023-04-05 03:23:15]
[Which institutions buy NVDA at those levels?,;,; It is well known that retail investors do not move the markets especially trillion dollar companies.  Even if some retails investors pour their 401Ks or excess cash into NVDA this would not create any significant price appreciation.   So institutional buyers are the ones pouring million of dollars every day to this company with a P/E or more than 200  So my question is if they know something we all miss, (maybe something  such as a new product that was not announced during the recent earnings but insiders know it) or the institutions are masked WSBs managing billions?   Every institution had the opportunity to buy NVDA at 250 when ChatGPT was talk of the town. Everyone could buy NVDA at 300 before earnings.  Everyone could also buy NVDA at 390 after earnings.  So who is buying today at 430 and why?,;,; 2023-06-15 00:56:03]
[NVDA did not file a new shelf offering.,;,; No open positions in NVDA, but follow it. I‚Äôm seeing a misunderstanding run wild and thought I‚Äôd make a post to address it: NVIDIA on Friday did not file for NEW shelf offering. They filed an amendment to the one from February (the difference being dilution of 20 billion vs 10 billion). Further, the quarterly report explicitly addressed that this filing was coming purely for administrative purposes and that they actually have no plans to use it anytime soon (ie no dilution at all anytime soon).  The bear narrative that the rug has been pulled isn‚Äôt correct and everything can be understood by reading the quarterly report.,;,; 2023-05-28 14:50:28]
[how do investors justify buying nvda given the risks at this price?,;,; their NVDA last annual revenue was around 26bil dollars, but around 30% came from taiwan, 20% came from china, 25% came from other foreign countries ex-US. so majority is foreign country and its likely the us will put more restrictions on sales from china, which will just crash their biggest customer market. there's also uncertainty to how much will come from taiwan or other foreign countries if those places have a recession or something, if this was ANY other company the stock will tank, but since its the biggest chip company here and people think it can just outmanuver policy or maybe a recession? how is that even justified? so even if the us market doesnt have a recession how would it be able to recover uncertainty in sales declines from other markets?,;,; 2023-08-23 04:36:55]

[NVDA looks to have a blow off top.,;,; Pretty straight forward technical analysis.NVDA trading at this valuation doesn't make sense. I think its headed to $275. Everyone keeps talking about AI and how its a Iphone moment, its not. AI has been around for years. Chat GPT is just a new toy. AI like all technologies will continue to advance but i don't think NVDA will be the primary benefactor from continued technological advancement in the space.

[Why $NVDA is a buy if you plan to hold for more than 2 years,;,; If we assume a sustainable long term PE of 20, you can expect no true growth for 2024, but there's no guarantee of a dip to buy it cheaper. 2024 earnings will bring the PE down to 25 at the current price. This is when you can expect real growth to start. 2025 earnings growth is forecast to be up another 50%. With PE falling from 25 to 20 this would mean stock price growth of about 40%. Thereafter expect the stock to grow like for like with earnings.

[This is why I held and kept buying Nvidia (NVDA),;,; https://www.tomshardware.com/news/chatgpt-nvidia-30000-gpus  I'm unsurprised by this article, mainly because after researching machine learning systems and platforms, I discovered that Nvidia is *the* leader in the field, and has been almost since its inception.  They lead the industry by about 6 years, and the gap appears to be widening rather than converging.  Pretty much every company that utilizes machine learning has Nvidia as its hardware platform- so that's not just ChatGPT, it's Google, Apple, Tesla, GM, all the big funds experimenting with machine learning trading and forecasting algorithms, pretty much everyone.  And this market is just getting bigger, faster.  People freaked out over gamers not buying because of inflated prices and miners offloading hardware they couldn't use anymore because of restrictions in China, but I was aware an underlying revenue stream was solid and prepared to widen.

[Anyone get frustration with themselves not buy more Magnificent 7 ?,;,; In early 2023, I noticed that these Magnificent 7 should be in my portfolio, which I did get into Meta, NVDA, GOOD, and TSLA. Obviously, I got greedy by holding too much TSLA and sold off during the crash from February 2023. Luckily, I had some META but I sold it off during February 2023. However, I managed to hold my NVDA, which was up so much, but eventually, I sold it at $425 in August.

[AI - while AI revolution is benefiting NVDA, how come storage providers like STX, WD, Toshiba are down ?,;,; AI depends on data. This data will need to be stored somewhere.

SSDs (solid state/flash) carry the rest of the data.   https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/05/16/monday-gartner-hdd-ssd-numberfest/  Will AI need more HDD or SSD ? Or both and hence demand for both will go up ?  There are only few (like 3/4 ?) manufacturers of storage. STX, WD, Toshiba being the major ones. While their recent quarter revenues haven't yet shown any large demand related to AI and revenues haven't shown increase like that in NVDA revenue, wouldn't in the future they will have more AI driven demand ? like multiple times of current demand ?  If yes, how come these stocks are down ? recent revenues were down but isn't that like ignoring the potential demand from AI requirements ?

[NVDA shares have tripled in 2023, while the Nasdaq-100 has climbed 38% and the S&amp;P 500 has gained 16%,;,; AI Mania Triggers Dot-Com Bubble Flashbacks  Nvidia shares have nearly tripled this year. Investors question whether the stock can live up to the hype.  The dot-com bubble taught investors to be wary of stock-market rallies powered by a technological boom‚Äîthat is, until generative artificial intelligence sent tech stocks soaring this year.  Shares of Nvidia NVDA -0.39%, the graphics-chip maker at the heart of the frenzy, have nearly tripled in 2023, while the Nasdaq-100 has climbed 38% and the S&amp;P 500 has gained 16%.  For some investors, the surge in Nvidia‚Äînow the fifth-largest U.S. company by market value‚Äîis difficult to chalk up to anything but speculative mania. Its weighting in the benchmark stock indexes means everyday investors are at the whims of its trajectory, whether they believe in AI‚Äôs potential or not.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge boom in AI‚Äîsome people are scrambling to get exposure at any cost, while others are sounding the alarm that this will end in tears,‚Äù said Kai Wu, founder and chief investment officer of Sparkline Capital. ‚ÄúInvestors can benefit from innovation-led growth, but must be wary of overpaying for it.‚Äù  Nvidia is the primary producer of semiconductors backing artificial-intelligence systems. The company forecast a record $11 billion in sales for the recently ended quarter when it reported results in May, catching analysts off guard with the projected surge in customer demand.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when the excitement around AI really ramped up,‚Äù said Ryan McCormack, an Invesco senior exchange-traded fund strategist.   The hype has driven companies such as Meta Platforms and Amazon.com that have been building out AI capabilities, he said. Shares of the tech giants are up 154% and 65% in 2023, respectively. Microsoft, which has climbed 35%, has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, a chatbot that can answer difficult questions in seconds.  The furious rally in those stocks, long the market‚Äôs biggest drivers, has fanned worries about market concentration. The 10 biggest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 now comprise more than a third of the market, according to Dow Jones Market Data. They represented 27% of the index at the start of the year and less than a quarter in 2000.  ‚ÄúThe market story that rhymes most with the internet bubble is the concentration of leadership,‚Äù said Mike Edwards, deputy chief investment officer of Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers.  Nvidia‚Äôs second-quarter earnings report, due Aug. 23, will provide insight into whether its inexorable rise is well-rooted in demand for chips, or a product of hype. The stock gained 24% in the trading session after its earnings reported in May, and 14% the day following February‚Äôs results.  Investors are paying up for the shares, betting on a windfall down the line. Nvidia is trading at 41 times its sales from the last 12 months, according to FactSet, compared with 2.4 times sales for the S&amp;P 500. On a forward basis, the stock trades at 20 times its expected sales for the year ahead‚Äîdouble its average over the last decade of 10 times, according to Dow Jones Market Data.   The nascency of AI programs such as ChatGPT means it is likely too early to determine whether Nvidia can raise revenue in line with the eye-watering valuation investors have slapped on its shares. If the company‚Äôs growth isn‚Äôt enough to reflect its price, the stock could crater.  A basket of 43 high-multiple internet stocks‚Äîthose worth at least $5 billion that traded at 25 times their revenue at the turn of the century‚Äîcrashed 80% over the next two years, according to Sparkline.   The companies weren‚Äôt duds, either. Their sales grew 10-fold in the ensuing two decades. But investors were badly bruised from the bust: The shares returned an average of 16% in that time span. The S&amp;P 500 returned 284%.  The basket included Amazon and Microsoft, both darlings of today‚Äôs market, along with Cisco Systems, then one of the largest companies in the Nasdaq-100. The networking- equipment maker traded as high as 38 times its sales in early 2000. Cisco has returned 43% since the start of the century‚Äîit is down 0.4% when excluding dividends.  ‚ÄúValuations matter,‚Äù said Wu. ‚ÄúInvesting in stocks exposed to rapidly growing technologies only works if the growth is not already priced in. Unfortunately, in periods of euphoria, the market has a tendency not only to price in potential growth, but to greatly overextrapolate it.‚Äù  One reason why this rally might lack the boom-and-bust nature of the dot-com bubble: The beneficiaries of artificial intelligence were the stocks already shining this year. Investors were flocking to big tech in the first quarter, seeking shelter in strong balance sheets and cash flows.  Tech companies are also benefiting from the expected end of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest-rate campaign and resilient consumer spending. Cyclical sectors of the broader market have begun to catch up now that recession fears are fading.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like 1999 when investors were racing to hot IPOs for companies that had no chance of making money,‚Äù said Edwards. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs winners are disciplined, enormous companies that have moats in place and data sets to exploit.‚Äù,;,; 2023-08-11 12:53:17]

[This doesn't feel sustainable for a nearly $1 TRILLION Company!,;,; tl;dr at bottom   Not trying to start a debate, I'm not long or short $NVDA, don't own any, and I don't plan to open a position anytime soon, I'm just your monthly buyer of $VOO and $QQQ.    However, to the bulls out there, what is the reason for such a MASSIVE premium for this stock?  I understand they crushed earnings and increased foecast to a nearly 50% gain in revenue by Q1 2024, but even with that premium, they are trading at a nearly 200 P/E.    Assuming NVDA maintains that 50% premium and holds it for all 4-quarters in 2024, thats $44B in revenue which if they had 100% margins and zero cost of any kind, it would take you almost 22 years to payback the value of the stock.   Sure, someone will tell me P/Es don't matter, and they are growing like crazy, but at what point is the value of the stock (again, almost $1 TRILLION) still out of control?   \- Their Gross Profit is 56% which is impressive, but not unherd of (MSFT is 68%, META is 80%)    \- Their net income is 16% which is right in line with everyones favoriate not a car company TESLA at 15%  Lets throw out fundamentals since they clearly don't matter that much for this stock and look at their growth:  $7.19B (lower than Q1 2022 of $8.29B).    Their Q4 22 Revenue was $6.05B vs. Q4 21 of $7.64B  So grow is slower/stagnant from the previsous years, so why does that get such a massive premium?  Did they beat earnings estimates, yes, but those were concervitive.  Did they raise guidance by 50% due to the AI boom, yeah, how long will that last?  Same length as the gaming/crypto/at home boom?

Whether it's one of your friends who head on went into the storm or you just decided to short cramer, what was your experience?  In the last year, here's mine:  Notably:   META at 330 - who seriously trusts Mark with the Meta verse right now cause I can't even trust him to keep my lunch on the table  SOFI at 12 - it was just too early for me at that point that I couldn't trust them  TROW at 100 - it did well for a while and I was kicking myself at 130 wishing I could've sold but I never invested in the first place!  And one that I got very wrong:  NVDA at 130 - to be fair, I don't touch AMD, TSM, NVDA etc but I thought it was going to level off there and called out one of my friends for going in.

I had recommended NVIDA #NVDA at $116 in Oct 2022 as the best in its class -- on strong product innovations such as the new RTX gaming series, and the Hopper and the Grace in data center. Now, its price has more than doubled to $265, helped by the disinflation rally of January 2023, the expected growth from generational AI A100, AI chips that are being used for Microsoft (MSFT) and AI [C3.ai](https://c3.ai/), Inc.

This is what the CEO wrote to bagholders:  ‚ÄúAt 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends.

[Not all "tech" companies deserve to have tech valuations,;,; I often hear a lot about how this &amp; that company are the next Amazon so the PE ratio does not apply to them.  There's a simple question that can tell you whether a company can have tech PEs: do they have unique products that enable them to grow their profit exponentially while keeping their costs linear? If the answer is no, they are just waiting for a correction. Even Amazon's valuation is mostly due to AWS &amp; not their retail side.   For example:  Uber should not have a tech valuation: they are a modern cab company that needs to hire drivers and deal with local presence &amp; its costs grow at the same rate as its revenue. That's why they are not profitable &amp; likely never will be.  TSLA is another one, we can all see now that they want to scale, their margins are shrinking &amp; getting closer to all other car manufacturers.  NVDA is even more prevalent: datacentres don't need an infinite number of GPUs to use pre-trained models to run generative AI applications. They currently have a demand surge &amp; after one or two quarters, the demand will go down just like the crypto craze. The $1 trillion projection Jensen did was pure nonsense. No semi company should have software tech PEs as they cannot grow exponentially while keeping their costs linear. Especially a company like NVDA which is at the mercy of TSM, ASML &amp; others to produce anything.   Edit: No, I don't have exposure to NVDA but the subreddit is full of FOMO posts in last 3 days.

They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets.   Most analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least.

Maybe even swap META &amp; TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE.  Should we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world? Should we consider cyclicality? There's no doubt that all 7 of these companies are leaders and are probably not going anywhere in the near future.

LYFT- Explosive again today, moving another 11%. May be related to the share buyback that Uber is going to do, but UBER flat on day.        NNOX- Up as part of NVDA disclosing new stakes in the company. Not going to be as explosive as BMR.        NVDA- Again, still watching that $750 level and close to it.

[Why is Nvidia so cheap?,;,; Nvidia's valuation based on forward earnings is cheaper than it's ever been since it's data centre business took off. Why is this? Do investors not believe it can continue growing after it's already grown so much? This sounds a lot like what people were saying when Apple hit $1T and look how that turned out.  Do you think NVDA is a smart long term buy. Will their software services lock people into their "ecosystem" to make up for GPU sales that will eventually slow?,;,; 2023-12-16 10:04:44]

[Tesla net income and earnings drop more than 20% from last year,;,; Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.  Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv  Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates  Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.  Automotive revenue, Tesla‚Äôs core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.  Tesla‚Äôs first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.  The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.  Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.  Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.   Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management‚Äôs consideration were seeking updates on the company‚Äôs trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company‚Äôs energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.  In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.  A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day‚Äôs drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.  According to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.  Tesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023.

[Can anyone explain the theory that "they" (market makers/hedge funds/whoever) push a price down to avoid having to pay out for call options?,;,; I heard a commentor somewhere mention it in passing, but they didn't explain it in detail.  They hypothesized that people would have calls on NVDA which went up a lot in the after hours last night, but that today "they" (market makers/hedge funds/someone?) would push the price down to avoid having to pay out for those calls.  Can someone explain this in more depth?   Also, can someone who actually worked in an institution/hedge fund/market maker verify whether they ACTUALLY do this? It sounds very odd, is it illegal? It also seems dangerous because if they think a stock should go up, and they force the price down by SELLING TONS OF SHARES, it seems like a risky gamble because what if it doesn't work and now they have even less shares.   I feel like when this idea gets brought up, it's always by people who have no experience working in the industry, so how would they actually know it happens? What if it's just a conspiracy like "oh the bad guys came and pushed down the price of my stock and that's why I lost money".   Does anyone have links to interviews or youtube videos where industry people actually say this really happens? (No offense but if a person has never worked in the industry, how would they know that this kind of stuff happens? It would be like trusting a person with no military experience to tell you about secret strategies only people deep in the military would know),;,; 2023-08-24 15:16:05]

[Britain blocks Microsoft‚Äôs $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard,;,; LONDON ‚Äî Britain‚Äôs top competition regulator on Wednesday moved to block[ Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)‚Äôs acquisition of video game publisher [Activision Blizzard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ATVI/).  The  measure marks a major blow for the U.S. tech giant, as it seeks to  convince authorities that the deal will benefit competition.  Microsoft said it plans to appeal the decision.  The  U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said that it opposed the deal as  it raises competition concerns in the nascent cloud gaming market.  Microsoft  could make Activision‚Äôs games exclusive to its cloud gaming platform,  Xbox Game Pass, cuting off distribution to other key players in the  space, the CMA said.  Cloud gaming is a technology that enables  gamers to access games via companies‚Äô remote servers ‚Äî effectively  streaming a game like you would a movie on Netflix. The technology is  still in its infancy, but Microsoft is betting big on it becoming a  mainstream way of playing games.  Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in January 2022 for $69 billion, in [one of the biggest deals the video game industry has seen](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-buy-activision.html) to date.  Executives  at the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant believe the  acquisition will boost its efforts in gaming by adding lucrative  franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga to its content  offerings.  However, some of Microsoft‚Äôs competitors contested the  deal, concerned it may give Microsoft a tight grip on the $200 billion  games market. Of particular concern was the prospect that Microsoft [may shut off distribution access to Activision‚Äôs popular Call of Duty franchise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/09/16/microsoft-is-growing-tired-of-sonys-call-of-duty-complaints/?sh=bd568595ebb9) for certain platforms.  [Sony](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/6758.T-JP/), in particular, has voiced concern with Microsoft‚Äôs Activision purchase.  The Japanese gaming giant fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty  exclusive to its Xbox consoles in the long run.    Microsoft sought to allay those concerns by offering Sony, [Nintendo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7974.T-JP/), [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)  and other firms [10-year agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/microsoft-says-it-will-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-for-10-years.html) to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms.  Microsoft  argues it wouldn‚Äôt be financially beneficial to withhold Call of Duty  from PlayStation, Nintendo and other rivals given the licensing income  it generates from keeping the game available on their platforms.  Microsoft  President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering  Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo ‚Äî to make Call of Duty  available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same  features. Sony still opposes the deal.  The CMA had raised concerns  with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent  cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which  offers cloud gaming among its perks. Microsoft has committed to bring  new Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass on day one of its release.  Cloud  gaming, or the ability to access games via PC or mobile devices over  the internet, is still in its infancy and requires a strong broadband  connection to work well. According to network intelligence firm  Sandvine, cloud gaming made up less than 1% of global internet traffic  in 2022.  Even with the CMA‚Äôs blessing, Microsoft will still need to convince other regulators not to block the deal. The EU [continues to probe the merger](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/microsoft-will-bring-xbox-games-to-nvidias-cloud-gaming-service.html) to assess whether it hurts competition, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission [sued to block the deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-game-giant-activision-blizzard.html) on antitrust grounds.

[43 years old and I just invested in stocks for the first time in my life,;,; Hi everyone!  I decided to post here because I'm anxious, scared, and excited at the same time because I finally saved up some money and invested it for the first time.  I quit drinking beer and buying useless crap, and saved up (don't laugh) $1,000 dollars and had it sitting there in a credit union with pennies for interest and I didn't like that.    I'm really kicking myself for not doing this when I was younger.  I remember when I was in my mid 20's "this close" to making a brokerage account and getting started, and I never did it.  Did this scare any of you the first time you got in to trading?    The first share I bought was 1 full share in the Vanguard VGT ETF.  I know it sounds dumb, but it was pretty scary and exciting at the same time.  My position is focusing 80% ETFs and sprinkle in some individual stocks to play around with.    My primary goal is dividends and compound reinvesting, in the hopes that I can have a nice-ish passive income 20-30 years from now.  I'm wondering what you guys think of my current positions:  **ETFs:** VGT, VONG, VTI, SCHD, and SCHG  **Stocks** *(I bought fractions of these)*:  AAPL, AMZN, HD, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, O, RTX, WM, WMT  That was my attempt of diversifying.

[Nvidia board member dumps $48 million more in stock amid monster rally,;,; Harvey Jones, who has been on the board since 1993, has unloaded more than $76 million worth of Nvidia shares so far this month.  A longtime board member at Nvidia Corp. dumped more than $48 million worth of the chip maker‚Äôs shares earlier this week, cashing in on the stock‚Äôs recent surge.        Harvey Jones, who has been on the Nvidia NVDA, -0.80% board since 1993, sold nearly 120,000 shares of the company Tuesday at prices between $400 and $408.51, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission made public Wednesday. He pocketed $48.3 million through the transaction, which took place with shares that he held in his living trust.  Jones, who is also the managing partner of private-investment entity Square Wave Ventures, holds 676,396 shares of Nvidia through the trust after Tuesday‚Äôs activity.

The latest transaction by Jones follows a move by the Nvidia director to unload 70,205 shares at an average price of $405 on June 2, according to a filing from earlier in the month. He made over $28 million through that earlier burst of selling.        Jones is reducing his Nvidia holdings as the stock has seen a massive run up so far this year, rising nearly 200% over that span.

Here are some options to consider:        Overall Top Performers:        AppLovin (APP): +255.9% year-to-date (based on 2023 performance), driven by strong AI-powered advertising performance and positive financials.    Symbotic Inc. (SYM): +154.5% in the last quarter, boosted by rapid revenue growth in supply chain automation and AI adoption by major retailers.    Nvidia (NVDA): +122.5% in the last quarter, fueled by booming data center business and optimism about AI applications.    Meta Platforms (META): +85.4% in the last quarter, rebounding from a 2022 downturn thanks to recovering online advertising demand.    Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL): +68.7% in the last quarter, as travel and leisure stocks benefited from easing pandemic concerns.    Other notable gainers:        Palo Alto Networks (PANW): +48.5% in the last quarter, driven by cybersecurity demand amid increasing cyber threats.

[TSMC posts flat Q4 revenue but beats expectations,;,; TAIPEI, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Taiwan chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW) reported a largely flat fourth-quarter revenue on Wednesday, but that still beat both the company's and market's expectations.   The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple (AAPL.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O), has benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence applications that has helped it weather the tapering off of pandemic-led demand.   Revenue in the final three months of last year came in at T$625.5 billion ($20.10 billion), according to Reuters calculations, compared with $19.93 billion in the year-ago period.  That beat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (TSMC) previous prediction for fourth-quarter revenue being in a range of between $18.8-19.6 billion, and also beat an LSEG SmartEstimate of T$617.1 billion drawn from 21 analysts.     *Source:* [https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmcs-december-sales-down-84-yy-2024-01-10/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/tsmcs-december-sales-down-84-yy-2024-01-10/),;,; 2024-01-10 20:51:34]

[The future picks and shovels of AI may not be GPUs but ASICs, following the crypto trajectory. GOOGL and the dreaded Samsung appear to be the leaders in this space. What is the highest-weighted Samsung ETF and what are other industry-leading AI FPGA/ASICs tickers?,;,; For context and a disclaimer, I own NVDA (and AAPL and ASML) in this space, having ridden through the last crash and rebound without checking my portfolio and counting fake money, but I am overexposed and don't want to add to the overweighted positions now.   I think that NVDA will always be an important company at the forefront of AI research, there is a good chance that NVDA's trajectory could be similar to its performance after the fall of cr*pto for the same reasons. In NVDA's favor, you can read any AI paper, which will be benchmarked on NVDA GPUs, download the requisite libraries, and do it yourself. It is a royal pain to implement algorithms on any other GPU even if you found a programmer with a 5-page blog post about how to do it with lots of particular versions of out-dated libraries, so I own NVDA. CUDA rocks, but NVDA doesn't want to let it out. Metal for OSX is pretty good, but no one uses it and AAPL doesn't do serious system on a chip cluster/cloud computing yet, though they will have an announcement 2-3 years out given Tim Cook's slow feet. For example, we are going to see AAPL AR/VR this week, but he probably didn't shovel out AAPL's piles of cash until FB announced that it was now Meta and that Zuckerberg would be the lord of the metaverse with the most awesome meta-real-estate.  Back to the previous fall of NVDA, you could once pool mine shitcoins with GPUs, I've done it, but that became energetically unprofitable when people found a cheaper way to do it, first with FPGAs and then with ASICs, which require millions and millions more to make work once you know exactly what you need to make. The advantage is that fewer operations occur with parallelizable algorithms, and FPGAs use less energy than do-anything GPU/CPU computations, but they are an expensive pain to program. When you are absolutely done building a better mousetrap, ASICs use the least amount of energy and can perform operations much faster and price-out GPUs in terms of upfront costs (once printed) and recurring energy costs. There was a time when you couldn't but NVDA's best GPUs for gaming because people were using them to mine shitcoins (diclaimer: I own a less than 5% stake of ETH2, and negligible bitcoin, only as an alternative to shit-yield savings accounts, which would be better off in treasuries anyway). I digress. A point came where it was dumb to mine with GPUs because ASICs arrived, and proof-of-work algorithms made it dumb to mine in the first place, which was waste of carbon footprint in the first place. Then, NVDA GPU prices crashed along with NVDA stock, but NVDA was still the machine learning leader. At some point, this will happen to NVDA again. MSFT is already shoveling cash at AMD to build their next AI supercomputer to undercut NVDA prices, but AMD's price is too high right now for me, even when I love tech stocks as I don't plan to retire for decades, and I think AMD won't win with their GPUs in the very long term because of ASICs, even if they make a CUDA-clone language and open source it.    Years ago, a paper titled "Attention is all you need" rocked the AI world and spawned GPT, GPT2, up to GPT4. Given the fifth largest GPU-based supercomptuer, a search engine's worth of data that people gave away, you can build a great AI mousetrap that can do the job students and corporate middle managers and pencil pushers. In a decade or two, programming complex programs with human-levels of bugs and mistakes will be a reality. We have a good mousetrap. Googles TPU v4 supercomputers use optics-based AI ASICs produced and patented by Samsung. I used to be a fan of Samsung, but then new management took over and it has dived off a cliff. Their appliances have the performance of robots bathed in saltwater, and I swore of Samsung phones after using them since forever when they started pushing shit malware games and apps onto my phone with every urgent security update, and every new phone increasingly locked app developers out of the real hardware, so you could use the Samsung app for a camera, but nothing else. But, and please correct me if I am wrong, I think Samsung may be the current leader in AI ASICs. I thinking GOOGL is still behind and their new Samsung-based supercomputer is the wrong mousetrap, but GOOGL programmers have certainly already been tasked with building a GOOGL v5 supercomputer that is dedicated to the transformers that underpin GPT through GPT4. I don't own GOOGL, but I may buy it during market corrections.    Unfortunately, I don't have hundreds of K for an international account, and the Samsung OTC ticker doesn't correlate with Samsung's price in Korea and I don't trust it. I read about ETFs trying to reduce Samsung's weight, but I want an ETF that is dominated by it. Samsung still makes great sensors, invests heavily in research, and some departments within the fetid bureaucracy are still highly competent. So, please offer any ETF suggestions. I am fine with also investing in Korea's broader tech industry, despite the problems with Asian tech companies and their lagging China-based supply chains and the problems with China deciding that money is no longer free in its state-based kleptocracy economy.   Please send me any tickers that I can research that may not have caught the current AI wave and that might still be well positioned for large future returns assuming that AI ASICs become the future, which I feel is a given. This might include companies dedicated to programming FPGAs and ASICs.,;,; 2023-06-02 16:41:58]

[Tesla stock closes below $200, hits 5-month low as a tough October rolls on,;,; Despite a larger market gain, Tesla (TSLA) shares fell 4.8% on Monday, going below $200 and reaching its lowest level since late May. The drop was caused by two major factors:        **1.** Tesla's battery supplier, Panasonic, cut vehicle battery output in Japan during the third quarter, decreasing its annual profit prediction by 15%. This was attributable to a worldwide slowdown in EV sales. Panasonic provides battery cells to Tesla's Nevada Gigafactory in the United States. However, the Japanese manufacturing drop had an impact on customers worldwide, not only in North America.        **2.** ON Semiconductor revealed lower-than-expected profit and revenue guidance due to decreasing sales. ON Semiconductor manufactures silicon carbide chips used by Tesla in its EV powertrain and other important components. A decline in demand for these chips is viewed as a possible indicator of slowing EV sales, notably for Tesla.        Tesla investor Gary Black said that the stock's downturn could be attributed to ON Semiconductor's -18% projection failure. This was owing to concerns about the increasing danger to vehicle demand caused by rising interest rates.        Tesla shares have dropped roughly 22% in the last month, but are still **up 60% year to date.**        ,;,; 2023-10-31 10:56:43]
[Reminder: PE doesn't work for valuing high growth companies.,;,; I see a lot of focus on PE here and i get the impression that people don't know what PE is. PE looks back on the past 4 quarters of data and compares it to today's share price. The past 4 quarters is relevant for reasonably stagnant companies as you can assume the future value will be similar. If you want to value a growth company however you should not use this metric.  One of the best ways to illustrate this is to simply link a chart of PE for a high growth company. https://ycharts.com/companies/NVDA/pe_ratio   See the step change every quarter? When a company is growing the previous quarters from a year ago weigh into the PE equation. You don't get to factor these out until the next quarterly report lands which leads to a massive step change as the recent quarter pushes the 1 year past quarter out of the equation.   For high growth companies you're better off looking at forward PE. In this case it's 25x. Or if you want forward PE with growth there's PEG. In this case there's an expected 8% quarterly growth.   I keep seeing posts complaining about the PE of high growth companies but i worry this is simply due to a lack of understanding on valuations. I hope this helps.,;,; 2023-11-28 18:24:02]

Net income, at $21.87 billion, or $2.93 per share, increased from $16.43 billion, or $2.20 per share.  The company‚Äôs Intelligent Cloud segment produced $25.88 billion in revenue, up 20% and above the $25.29 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by Refinitiv. The grouping contains Azure cloud infrastructure, SQL Server, Windows Server, Nuance, GitHub and enterprise services.  Within that segment, revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 30%. Analysts polled by CNBC had expected 27.7% growth, and the StreetAccount consensus was 27.5%. The metric for the previous quarter was 29%.  Revenue from the Productivity and Business Processes unit including Office productivity software, LinkedIn and Dynamics totaled $19.25 billion. That was up 13% and higher than the $18.99 billion StreetAccount consensus.  The More Personal Computing segment contributed $16.89 billion in revenue, up about 19% and more than the StreetAccount consensus of $16.79 billion. The segment comprises Windows, Surface, Bing and Xbox.  During the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft closed its acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, its largest deal ever.

[Cathie Wood calls Nvidia stock 'overpriced' after missing 2023 rally,;,; Cathie Wood isn't buying the artificial intelligence hype at Nvidia (NVDA).        The founder of Ark Invest, and noted tech innovation investor, tweeted on Monday that the AI darling is now overpriced.       Nvidia shares have risen more than 30% since the company reported earnings on May 24, and the stock touched a $1 trillion dollar market cap on Tuesday.            Wood and Ark sold their holdings in Nvidia back in January. Since Nvidia's stock has more than doubled as investors have dubbed the company the clear leader in the AI chipmaking arms race. In just the past week, Nvidia announced revenue guidance that blew away Wall Street estimates and followed that news up with new AI-focused product launches.   It hasn't just been Nvidia stock soaring, either. On Friday, Marvell Technology (MRVL) said the company expects revenue attributable to AI to double the next year. Shares rose more than 30% on the news amid a broader AI-infused tech rally that's continued into Monday's trading session.   With the Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) now up more than 2.5% in the last five days, Wood argues there are going to be other winners in the AI space outside of Nvidia.   "Other companies with visionary leaders, strong global distribution and, perhaps most important, large-high-quality pools of proprietary data should be big #AI winners, with revenues and earnings surprising significantly on the high side of expectations during the years ahead," Wood tweeted.   There will be "dozens" of AI winners, according to Wood. But the one that stands out to Ark, as it often does, is Tesla (TSLA).   Wood argues that at six times revenue, Tesla stock is far cheaper than Nvidia's current 25 times revenue valuation.   "(Tesla) is the most obvious beneficiary of the recent breakthroughs in #AI, as it aims for an $8-10 trillion revenue TAM in autonomous mobility by 2030," Wood wrote.   With several positive headlines in the news of late including a growing relationship in China, Tesla shares are up more than 7% amid the broader tech rally.     Wood's Nvidia comments come as her flagship ETF, the Ark Innovation Fund (ARKK), has struggled to return to its pandemic dominance. The ETF skyrocketed during the risk-on bull market of 2020 with high-flying pandemic darlings like Tesla, Zoom (ZM), and even Nvidia contributing to gains.   But as the Federal Reserve enacted its most aggressive interest rate hike campaign in four decades, risky bets became less popular with investors. Some of Ark's top holdings, such as Zoom, Roku (ROKU), and Coinbase (COIN) are well off their pandemic highs.   The fund itself lost more than $1 billion in market cap in 2022 with shares falling nearly 67%.,;,; 2023-05-31 10:22:50]

Better than expected labor market data, the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and optimism about a potentially dovish Federal Reserve have helped boost the beaten down sector. But Gene Munster, a veteran tech analyst and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, warned Monday that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could pop tech investors‚Äô bubble this week.   Fed Chair Powell will appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday in his first public outing since a Feb. 7 interview with the private equity billionaire David Rubenstein that was largely interpreted as dovish by markets. He‚Äôs expected to discuss February‚Äôs Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes, where most Fed officials said they anticipated ‚Äúongoing‚Äù rate hikes and some even argued that recent labor market strength warrants a ‚Äútighter stance of monetary policy.‚Äù  Munster argued that Powell realized after his comments last month that if he is not ‚Äúoverly hawkish‚Äù‚Äîrepeatedly doubling down on his inflation-fighting stance‚Äîevery time he speaks, then markets interpret it as a sign that he will pause interest rate hikes or even pivot to cuts.  As a result, the tech analyst said that he expects to see Powell ‚Äúretreat to his fallback position of a more hawkish tone‚Äù during the hearing. And a hawkish Fed is never good for tech stocks, which rely on low rates to invest in their growth and are often valued using the Fed‚Äôs benchmark interest rate.,;,; 2023-03-07 14:59:09]
[Intel stock sinks as early 2024 outlook comes up short,;,; [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/intel-intc-earnings-report-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/intel-intc-earnings-report-q4-2023.html)  Intel  shares dropped in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker issued an outlook for the first quarter of 2024 that lagged analyst forecasts even as results for the latest quarter beat Wall Street estimates.        Here‚Äôs how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December:        Earnings per share: 54 cents adjusted, vs. 45 cents expected    Revenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.15 billion expected      For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue.        Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 billion, or 16 cents per share, last year.        With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue.        Intel shares are up over 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia  and AMD  on Wall Street.        Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia‚Äôs recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs.        Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by CEO Pat Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company  in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips.        Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye  into an independent company in 2022.        Intel‚Äôs largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%.        Intel‚Äôs second largest division, Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 10% to $4 billion. That unit includes server CPUs and GPUs.        Intel foundry services, its business making chips for other companies, remains nascent, with $291 million in revenue, a 63% annual increase.,;,; 2024-01-25 21:17:40]

[Billionaire at 34, Then $1.75: The Michael Saylor Story You've Never Heard Of,;,; Imagine this: You're the CEO of a public company, and those dreaded quarterly reports are just around the corner. But here's the catch ‚Äî your company's revenue isn't looking so hot. Panic mode sets in! ‚ò†  What do you do? You need extra revenue, and you need it fast! So, you come up with a "brilliant" idea. üí°  You find a partner, you invest in them, and in return, they magically **"buy"** your product. Voil√†! You've got revenue, albeit a bit inflated.  This nifty maneuver is what we call a **"boomerang" transaction**, and it fits the name perfectly, right?  Enter Michael Saylor, the current Bitcoin hero, was the unsung hero of the early 2000s internet boom. Many of you may not know but, he ran a tech company that soared to the heavens with a massively successful IPO, making him a billionaire at just 34.  But here's the **twist**:  Behind the scenes, the quarterly and annual reports were like a magician's trick, filled with carefully crafted financial shenanigans like the "boomerang" transactions, **made just before the period** ended.  As long as there was no Sherlock Holmes-level auditing, Michael Saylor was living the American dream to the max!  But then came Forbes (yes, they were lit back then). They dropped the bomb, and PwC audited everything, exposing the grand scheme.  Michael called it "material accounting irregularities," but the market wasn't feeling generous. In a single day, the share price nosedived by a jaw-dropping 60%, and it finally hit rock bottom at $1.75. Ouch!  Now, we're left wondering whether Michael Saylor is still pulling these shenanigans. Only time will spill the beans.  **Moral** of the story, my fellow investors: Don't underestimate those SEC filing reports like 10K and 8K's, even if they're a tad bit boring, especially the footnotes and understand their revenue recognition practices. Your hard-earned money deserves nothing less! üíºüí∞     Edit: In no way I am saying all boomerang transactions are suspicious and fraudulent, but it becomes a problem if it is a key driver of revenue growth for a company, as was the case with MSTR. ,;,; 2023-09-08 20:49:17]
[Will this Backtest work in the real world?,;,;  I was recently inspired by Charlie Munger and decided to use his philosophy of inversion to build a back test. The question I asked myself is what makes a bad investment? To that I answered:   * They take on a lot of debt which adds risk to the company if things go wrong. * They give away the company to employees or in acquisitions diluting existing owners. * They don‚Äôt grow * Earnings don‚Äôt arrive in cash * They have a business model that can easily be recreated * They sell at a high price     To make a good company I reasoned I want to invert the bad company metrics. To model these factors I back tested through Portfolio 123 by ranking the following data:   * They take on a lot of debt which adds risk to the company if things go wrong.    * Low Debt to Assets: Reviewed Quarterly    * High Interest Coverage: implies debt load can be covered by earnings * They give away the company to employees or in acquisitions diluting existing owners.    * Low Equity Dilution: Kinda obvious * They don‚Äôt grow    * High Sales Per Share Growth * Earnings don‚Äôt arrive in cash    * High Free Cash Flow per Share Growth    * High Operating Cash Flow Growth per Share: Companies showing an upward trend in cash flow growth are preferred, as this signals ongoing operational success and growth, avoiding those that have become static. * They have a business model that can easily be recreated    * High Average Gross Margins: High gross margins suggest a company can add a lot of value to the raw materials or by the info they have. Economic theory would suggest if others could do the same, the price charged would not be that much higher than the inputs. * They sell at a high price    * High Yield of Gross Profit to Market Cap: Going down an income statement or cash flow has messier and messier financials. Focusing on the top level should give a cleaner Yield and I believe would allow for better valuation of earlier stage companies.      Here were the results:     [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M1Kxw5m6sFBr-a-b-Hks5qAF7jsewPFqkU2BpszlymM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M1Kxw5m6sFBr-a-b-Hks5qAF7jsewPFqkU2BpszlymM/edit?usp=sharing)  * The back test tab selects the higher ranked securities and market cap weights them subject to a 6% max weight and owns 100 stocks at a time from the Russell 1000 index. * The Ranking Score Tab shows an equal weighted average annualized return.    Portfolio123 adjusted for look ahead bias and delisted securities and all that.    The big question of course is, does anyone think this will work in the real world?

[Berlin, Intel strike deal on $33 billion chip plant after months of subsidy talks,;,; BERLIN/STOCKHOLM, June 19 (Reuters) - Intel (INTC.O) will invest more than 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in Germany as part of its expansion push in Europe, the U.S. company said on Monday, a project key to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ambitions to create a global chip hub.        The deal, which involves two leading-edge semiconductor facilities, involves 10 billion euros in German subsidies, a person familiar with the matter said.        Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said he was grateful to the German government and the local state of Saxony-Anhalt, where the company plans to built one plant, for "fulfilling the vision of a vibrant, sustainable, leading-edge semiconductor industry in Germany and the EU".        Under Gelsinger, Intel (INTC.O) has been investing billions in building factories across three continents to restore its dominance in chipmaking and better compete with rivals AMD (AMD.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Samsung (005930.KS).        The deal in Germany would be Intel's third big investment in four days, following a $4.6 billion chip plant in Poland and a $25 billion factory in Israel.        Both the United States and Europe are trying to lure big industrial players via a mix of state subsidies and favourable legislation, with Berlin concerned about losing appeal as a place to invest.        The German government is investing billions of euros in subsidies to lure tech companies to Germany amidst growing alarm over supply chain fragility and dependence on South Korea and Taiwan for chips.        Berlin is currently also talking with Taiwan's TSMC (2330.TW) and Sweden's electric vehicle battery maker Northvolt about setting up production in Germany, having already convinced Tesla (TSLA.O) to build its first European gigafactory there.        Frankfurt-listed Intel shares were 0.3% lower at 1316 GMT.        The chipmaker last year announced plans to build a big chip complex in Germany, along with facilities in Ireland and France, as it seeks to benefit from the European Commission's eased funding rules and subsidies as the EU tries to cut its dependence on U.S. and Asian supply.        It has not yet specified the exact size of the investment.        Gelsinger told Reuters on Friday that the gap between what Germany had offered and what Intel needed was too big but he expected to reach an agreement, adding that his request was to be cost competitive.        "We lost this industry to Asia, we have to be competitive if we're going to bring it back," he said, adding the overall investment for the site would be "tens of billions of dollars".

[Intel surges as Q2 results show PC rebound underway, strong guidance,;,; Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) shares rose more than 7.5% in extended-hours trading after the semiconductor giant posted second-quarter results that topped estimates and showed signs of a recovery in the PC market.  For the period ending July 1, Intel (INTC) earned an adjusted 13 cents per share on $12.9B in revenue, as the company's Client Computing Group generated $6.78B in revenue, above estimates.¬†  Revenue attributed to its Data Center and AI group fell 15% year-over-year to $4B, while Network and Edge revenue dropped 38% to $1.4B. Intel's nascent foundry unit saw a 307% surge in revenue to $232M.  The company also generated $454M in revenue attributed to Mobileye (MBLY), which it partially spun-off in October 2022.  A consensus of analysts expected ¬†the company to lose 3 cents per share on $12.14B in revenue.  AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) shares rose in after-hours trading following the results.  Looking ahead, Intel (INTC) said it expects third-quarter revenue to be between $12.9B and $13.9B, with the mid-point above the $13.28B estimate. It also expects adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share, topping the 13-cent-per-share estimate.  The Santa, Clara, California-based Intel (INTC) also said it is on track to deliver $3B in cost savings this year.

[Nvidia‚Äôs stock could fly to $550 amid ‚Äòrobust demand‚Äô across the board in AI, analyst says,;,; Nvidia Corp. is benefiting from ‚Äúrobust demand‚Äù for artificial-intelligence servers across the board, and that could help extend the stock‚Äôs stunning rally, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets.  KeyBanc analyst John Vinh upped his price target on shares of Nvidia NVDA, -0.76% to $550 from $500 late Monday, with his new target among the highest on Wall Street: Above Vinh‚Äôs $550 target were one $767 target price and two $600 target prices, according to FactSet. C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI matched Vinh at $550.  Shares closed Monday at $421.80, and they‚Äôre up 189% so far this year.  Vinh‚Äôs heightened optimism about Nvidia‚Äôs prospects comes after he conducted channel checks in Asia. Those indicated strong interest in AI servers that are ‚Äúnot only coming from cloud but also enterprise and from AI startups,‚Äù he wrote in a note to clients.  Additionally, he said he sees the potential for Nvidia to benefit from delays related to an Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, +0.36% product.  ‚ÄúDelays associated with AMD‚Äôs MI300 are likely to free up incremental capacity in 2H23, while we believe NVDA has secured enough capacity (CoWoS) to quadruple its datacenter revenues in 2024,‚Äù Vinh wrote, referring to chip-on-wafer-on-substrate, a type of packaging.   That said, Vinh also boosted his price target on shares of AMD, despite more ‚Äúmixed‚Äù channel checks there, compared with the ‚Äúpositive‚Äù ones for Nvidia.  ‚ÄúWhile near-term challenges associated with delays of its MI300 AI server and stability issues with its PC NB Ryzen Phoenix (7040) could result in near-term risk to estimates, AI server wins at HP/El Capitan, MSFT, and Meta give us high conviction that AMD could see well over $2B in AI revenues in 2024,‚Äù Vinh wrote, as he lifted his price target on the shares to $160 from $150.  Chip companies will begin reporting earnings in the coming weeks, and one trend to watch will be how server demand is playing out more broadly. ‚ÄúAI servers [are] seeing outsized demand but appear to be cannibalizing traditional server,‚Äù Vihn wrote in his note to clients.  He also flagged overall weakness in China, ‚Äúwith no signs of a recovery, which is limiting the inventory destocking process.‚Äù    https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidias-stock-could-fly-to-550-amid-robust-demand-across-the-board-in-ai-analyst-says-e157f522,;,; 2023-07-11 12:46:44]

[My attempt at DD for INTC in 2024,;,; Below is my novice attempt at providing half-decent DD in support a thesis. Two caveats: 1) I wanted to focus on US-based companies, and 2) This is a play in my Roth IRA ‚Äì Buy and Hold long term.  Reading the book CHIP WARS changed my portfolio and investment strategy. I‚Äôd heard of TSMC, AMD and NVDA, but wasn‚Äôt really sure how to quantify their value or compare against one another other than stock price (NVDA must be the best one, right?). According to the author, chips are the new gold, and will shape the global power alignment for the next couple decades. The book talks a ton about the history of semiconductors and the processes needed to create them, then and now, highlighting several key dependencies in the manufacturing and supply chain that I thought would represent potential targets for investment.  I began researching the supply chain in greater detail in the hopes of making it easier for a non-technical guy like me to understand the holistic system from a systems theory approach. A Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) article had a few graphics that helped The article. First is the value chain showing the 3 steps to chip creation; design, fabrication, and Assembly, Test, and Packaging (ATP).  Cool, now I just find out who does all of these things and invest, right? Not saying that wouldn‚Äôt work, but I‚Äôm kind of looking for an undervalued company with potential to grow (NVDA is out of my league at \~500/share, and probably overpriced). There are a lot of companies that compete in these spaces, some in one, many in multiple.  Design:  I focused on Design and Fabrication. There may be diamonds in the rough for ATP, but it was quite a bit broad in my initial research, and hard to narrow down/nothing stood out.  Starting with Design, the CSIS article provided a good starting point with a list of several major players. The same article stated that ‚Äúin the US and UK, Intel, ARM, and Cadence were core leaders in Intellectual property. For that reason, they were the three I chose to focus on.  Fabrication:  Fabrication plants (Fabs) are the most critical physical component in the manufacturing process, and there is a disproportionate dependency on TSMC fabs in Taiwan. There could be another post on the potential for China/Taiwan issues having a significant impact on the chip market, but for now, I will just highlight that the smallest chips in the world currently in mass production (3nm) are produced in TSMC and Samsung Fabs, making them key centers of gravity in the semi world.  But fabs are simply another ‚Äúsystem‚Äù in the larger system‚Ä¶ What are they made of? The three key components for fabs are lithography machines, ultra-pure air, and ultra-pure water. So I began to look at what companies specialize in those areas‚Ä¶  Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography (ASML) has a basic monopoly on Lithography machines, and recently sold its next generation lithography machines to Intel (more on that below). There are no shortage of Water and Air manufacturing companies. Again, focusing on US based companies, I arrived at Air Products ($APD), Hitachi ($HTHIY), and Xylem ($XYL).  US based APD has been relatively stagnant, but HTHIY has been on a general uptrend for a couple years now. This maybe an option as I get more comfortable with investments with overseas companies, but for now I move on to water. XYL hasn‚Äôt shown a lot of movement, but they do offer a small dividend. Still, not enough potential for growth in my opinion.  So, we have INTC with a ton of intellectual property and next generation Fab capabilities on the horizon. One final step before dumping my IRA into INTC; CEO research? I evaluated three basic components ‚Äì Who is the CEO, what he‚Äôs saying, and what he‚Äôs actually doing about it...  The CEO: If there was a ‚ÄúChips hall of fame,‚Äù Pat Gelsinger would be in it. He started at Intel in 1979, and has since made pit stops at several huge tech companies (e.g. VM Ware) along his way back to being named CEO in 2021. Bottom Line: Dude understands the industry and the company inner workings well.  What he‚Äôs saying: He‚Äôs put out several bold statements in the last couple years regarding Intel falling behind in AI, and wanting to catch up quickly. His product line going through intel right now is impressive, he‚Äôs doubling down on US-based production, and should compete with the major names in the AI Chips space in the near future with intel 4 CPUs and Meteor Lake CPUs.  What he‚Äôs doing: Pat Gelsingers major investments are currently focused on manufacturing, emphasizing bringing more chip production to the US. In Arizona, Intel invested $30 billion in two chip factories in Chandler. This is their biggest commitment to domestic chip production, and will produce advanced chips. As I mentioned above, Intel will be the first company to get the EUV lithography tool with a 0.55 numeric aperture (high-NA) from ASML this year and it's also going to obtain the majority of the company's machines in 2024. (What does high NA mean? Link below in comments) A unique opportunity associated with these new high-NA machines is the need for a lot of instrumentation and calibration. MKS Instruments ($MKSI) has been a long-time partner of Intel, and actually have a large location in Beaverton, Oregon, about 10 miles from the new Lithography machines location in at the Intel facility in Hillsboro, Oregon. MKSI has moved with INTC over the last few weeks as a sympathy play, but is approaching a $110 resistance line. If it gets through that, there is quite a bit of room to run prior to ATHs. They also pay a small dividend (1.29%). Maybe a side play with a LEAPS contract or two.  My plan is pretty simple, I think. Put 7K contribution into INTC (140 shares at $50). This will bring me to a total of 340 shares. Sell 3x Jan 26 $60 strike covered calls (\~$8 each) and put the $2400 in premium back into more INTC shares.  I'm sure I screwed some stuff up, and satisficed my way into an INTC outcome, but this was my zig zag research process.  (edit) TL;DR: INTC is likely to move up in the chip space as they prioritize next gen fabrication and AI. New fabs in Ohio, Israel, and Germany. My $7K IRA contribution this year is going all to INTC shares.,;,; 2023-12-31 23:34:18]
[Best growth oriented mid and small cap stocks?,;,; Anyone have thoughts on Olin, Zscaler or Welltower? Looking to reallocate about 20% of my portfolio that is currently invested in APPL. Would also love to hear any picks for small or mid cap companies with really good growth potential as the bulk of my portfolio is pretty balanced. The assets I have in Apple are earmarked for a more risky, higher growth allocation. Since i'm sure people would think i'm crazy to sell APPL, I have a rule not to invest in any companies working on or involved in accelerating the push for generative AI(MSFT, GOOG, META, NVDA).

[Why is Apple surging when China is in trouble?,;,; Apple is up 5% this week, 1.6% today. Some say it's because it announced the date it will reveal the new iphone. But didn't the market already expect this to happen? Why is it surging now, especially given that:  * Most experts don't think China's stimulus is going to dig itself out of the real estate bubble hole. * While we're not in a recession, consumer spending is slowing. * Apple has been relatively quiet in all the AI discussions.

[Tesla or Nvidia or Microsoft over the next 1-3 years?,;,; I'm interested in what your guys thoughts are on these 3 companies trajectories in the near future.  Tesla is actively reducing the prices on their EVs while other automakers can barely make a profit with their higher prices. I think they are just so far ahead of the competition that they will increase their market share along with the entire EV market growing.  Nvidia is obviously the king of AI right now and probably for the foreseeable future. Their forward PE is 40 and not too high for a growth stock. I don't see any real competitors, maybe AMD, but that's a stretch.  Microsoft is in an interesting spot. They acquired OpenAI and incorporated that in Bing. I'm not sure what direction they're trying to go with that. I'm not convinced they can take any meaningful market share from Google. I think Cloud and Gaming is where they will see huge growth in the near term.  If I were to pick one I would choose Tesla.,;,; 2023-09-26 18:22:31]

[Ways to estimate how ServiceNow and NVIDIA Partnership Impact ServiceNow's Bottom Line and share price?,;,; Hello r/Stocks,I've been trying to understand how to capitalize on the ongoing AI boom. I've been looking into ServiceNow (NYSE: NOW), which recently announced a partnership with NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA).     In articles from May 17, 2023, NVDA mentioned their plan to develop enterprise-grade generative AI capabilities to enhance business processes with faster, smarter workflow automation with NOW. NVDA's technology and infrastructure will be key to developing these custom large language models specifically for NOW platform.     ServiceNow already has some AI features, but this new partnership could introduce more uses for generative AI across the enterprise. It sounds like this could make a big difference to IT departments, customer service teams, employees, and developers by strengthening workflow automation and quickly increasing productivity.     It also seems like NOW will be using this new AI tech to help NVIDIA improve its own IT operations.They're working on various applications of generative AI to improve productivity. For example, they're developing intelligent virtual assistants and agents for handling user queries and support requests, as well as tools for customer service agents for automatic issue resolution and knowledge-base article generation.     On NVIDIA's end, they're providing AI Foundations cloud services and the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, which includes the NVIDIA NeMo framework. It looks like these tools will help developers build, customize, and deploy language models for different enterprise use cases.     How do you think this partnership could impact NOW' bottom line? Do you believe investing in NOW is a good way to take advantage of the AI boom, given this partnership with NVIDIA?     I'm eager to learn more about this and I appreciate any insight you all might be able to provide. Thanks!,;,; 2023-05-26 23:19:03]
[Why you should never invest in INTC (Intel),;,; Atom - Intel flounders industry leadership role and gets crushed by ARM processors for mobile applications.   NAND - Intel had NAND fabs in china that weren't even being close to profitable and sold to SK Hynix after wasting billions down the drain.   Optane - Micron Technology  shut down Joint Venture 3DXPOINT leaving intel without their silicon.  Altera -Intel purchased Altera the #2 fpga player for $17 billion  vastly over paying and seeing no ROI. Intel no longer breaks their fpga business out in their earnings presentations.   4G/5G Modem - complete failure business abandoned   Barefoot Networks - complete failure business abandoned  Gross Margins - INTC 38.4$ AMD 53% AVGO 73%  NVDA 67%  Talent/Stock - If an engineer at intel got 200k in rsus after 4 years they would be worth $183,784. At nvidia 200k in rsus would be worth $2.1 million. Why would anyone want to work at intel?   Capex: heavy cap ex requirements will keep pressure on margins  Competition: Intel faces stiff completion from AMD and NVIDIA when it comes to CPU applications. They are also missing out as the large datacenter customers develop their own custom silicon.   GPU - shit show at first when intel rolled out their cards. So many bugs and just terrible performance but looks like driver issues are being addressed an they are already past AMD and closing in on NVIDIA when it comes to their up sampling technology. I'm not very bullish on their GPUs because they had over a decade of experience for iGPU. It remains to be seen if intel GPPU/XPU products will be adopted by the large data center customers. Gamers are a much smaller slice of teh GPU supply now.    Mobile Eye: Probably intel's best decision in their 20 years as a company but they are so desperate for cash they are going to spin them off in an ipo,;,; 2023-07-22 12:19:40]

[I started investing in March 2019 and every year I'm in the red. What would you do?,;,; A couple days ago there was a post about your biggest wins. Some users turned 45k into 1.1m or how they invested in amc and made retirement level money.   [https://i.imgur.com/RKHteqB.png](This is how my portfolio looks like vs sp500 since March 2019)  * 2019: +18% * 2020: -6% * 2021: -7.5% * 2022: -6.2% * 2023: -15% Ytd (mostly etf, energy and tech)   I started investing in individual stocks and etfs with the strategy of "taking profits if it looks too good and selling off if I lose more than 50%"  My major trades:  - sold 50 tsla with 200% in 2020. It looked too good to be true especially when the whole economy was contracting due to covid. Luxury tech cars would be the first to go. If I had waited 2 years it would be +2000%.  - bought 2x inversed sp500 in January 2020 but forgot that 15% unemployement and all the shops closed is  like nothing for US economy. A milion deaths here and there doesn't change anything.  - bought 100 GME in 2019 and sold them for a loss just before the short squeeze because the stock has been on a downfall ever since. I hoped for a pivot of the whole strategy of gamestop for more than a year and finally sold not seeing any upward movement. Instead of +3800% got -27% - BYND -92%. I broke my rule here because I was on holidays when it dropped.  - Sold CDR before Cyberpunk release and got +120% because I knew it will be reciebed badly by critics but then bought back "at sale" shortly after the fall and sold at a loss seeing how it trends down.  - sold 100 NVDA in 2020 with +60%. Now it would be  +1000%  My overall realized gains is  -$8,000 and ytd is -15%  There is no hope at all for me. I tried to understand the stock market and can't. Since 2020 there is no logic. Penny stocks are doing +1000%, strong companies that have positive cash flows and very low liabilities are just cruising or going down. Bad companies not bringing any profits are exploding because they are being memes.  And I dont know what to do because it looks like the stock market will be flat for the next couple of years and interest rates for real estate are so humongous I don't qualify. I thought the stock market is the way to park money but this + inflation = I'm losing money left and right.  Edit: major stocks that I still hold since 2019.

[4 Tech stocks benefiting from the AI boom.,;,; The world of artificial intelligence (AI) these days is overwhelmingly dominated by discussions on generative AI and its implications. Simply put, generative AI is a form of machine learning through which AI software can produce text, video, images, and more. Basically, generative AI can produce any form of content on the basis of prompts. This form of AI became more widespread and renowned after the launch of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, which revolutionized the AI sector while pulling in major tech companies to become part of the AI race.        This form of AI and its impact on the markets was discussed by Jim Stewart, a New York Times columnist, on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on June 16. According to Stewart, big tech companies, especially those that are AI beneficiaries, have been leading the recent stock market rally. These include companies such as Microsoft Corporation ($MSFT), Alphabet Inc. ($GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA). Stewart claimed that he was bullish on AI, especially considering the fact that this technology could boost productivity gains across different fields, including journalism.        **AI and the US Stock Market**    In May, NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) joined the group of companies with valuations in trillions of dollars. Many financial professionals today are attributing the gains of the S&amp;P 500 to AI, primarily, with the focus being on NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) and other big tech companies that have begun incorporating AI and generative AI in their products and services.        This overwhelming focus on a select few number of companies that can successfully play the AI boom and come out victorious has led to many investors worrying that the stock market in 2023 will turn into a selection of a few winners and a lot more losers. The S&amp;P 500 has "basically been the S&amp;P 7," a reference to the fact that only seven major tech companies have been calling the shots so far in 2023, leading the market to heavily rely on them and their gains.        **"You Are At The Starting Line Of AI"**    This reality has led many professionals and corporations to realize that the AI boom is very real and may be here to stay. Companies today will be bound to figure out where they stand in this environment and how they can integrate AI into their business models to reap the benefits of this technological revolution. NVIDIA Corporation's ($NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, in an address at the National Taiwan University in May, stated that we are currently at "the starting line of AI" and that at this moment, we should run instead of walking. The implications of his statement are many, but perhaps the most obvious lesson to take away from Huang's speech is that companies and individuals today shouldn't be slow to join the AI race - they should try their best to become part of it and ensure they don't end up getting left behind by their competitors.        Keeping the above-mentioned market dynamics and developments in mind, I have compiled a list of the top tech stocks to consider investing in to play the AI boom. I included the obvious stock picks because of their contributions to this industry so far, but I also attempted to find other companies that wouldn't be the first to come to your mind when looking at AI beneficiaries today.   # Our Methodology    To select our stocks, I  looked at which companies analysts are expecting to benefit from the AI boom and shortlisted them based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter of 2023. The stocks are ranked based on this metric, from the lowest to the highest number of hedge funds long each of them.  # Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom      **1. Oracle Corporation ($ORCL)**       On June 13, Keith Bachman at BMO Capital raised his price target on Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) from $96 to $132. The analyst also holds a Market Perform rating on the stock.        Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) is an information technology company based in Austin, Texas. The company's products and services address enterprise information technology environments across the world.        I saw 67 hedge funds long Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $2.9 billion.        TD Cowen's John Blackledge expects Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) to benefit from the current AI boom because its cloud-computing platform can offer it some competitive advantages.        First Eagle Investment Management held 20.7 million shares in Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) at the end of the first quarter, making it the largest shareholder in the company.  **2. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD)**        CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) is an information technology company offering cybersecurity products and services. It is based in Austin, Texas.        There were 72 hedge funds holding stakes in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) at the end of the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $2.4 billion.        CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) may be an interesting stock pick to play the AI boom considering the company has recently announced new AI-powered indicators of attack (IoA) models. These models can combat advanced adversary tradecraft by using machine intelligence to stop breaches.        Tal Liani at Bank of America holds a Buy rating on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) shares as of June 16. The analyst also raised the firm's price target on the stock from $162 to $190.  **3. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD)**        Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) was spotted in the portfolios of 91 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $4.9 billion.        Based in Santa Clara, California, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) is a semiconductor company that operates globally.        Joseph Moore, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, raised his price target on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) shares on June 16 from $97 to $138. The analyst also holds an Overweight rating on the shares.        Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) is a chipmaker that TD Cowen's John Blackledge has picked as one of his tech stocks to play the AI boom. This is unsurprising considering the fact that this June, the company revealed its new AI chip in its race with NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA). The new MI300X chip was described by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) as "the world's most advances accelerator for generative AI."        Citadel Investment Group held 13.9 million shares in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) at the end of the first quarter, making the fund the most prominent shareholder in the company for that quarter.  **4. Adobe Inc. ($ADBE)**        Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) is a diversified software and information technology company based in San Jose, California. The company's flagship product is its Creative Cloud, a subscription service offering members access to its creative products.        John Blackledge at TD Cowen sees Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) as a smart AI play because the company has begun rolling out new generative-AI content creation tools.        An Outperform rating was reiterated on Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) shares on June 16 by Kirk Materne at Evercore ISI. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $475 to $590.        A total of 99 hedge funds were long Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $7.3 billion.  **4. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)**        Apple Inc.

[If the market dropped 10%, what one stock would you load up on immediately?,;,; Suppose the market took a sharp 10% drop due to any factors. Could be debt ceiling or maybe a bad economic outlook.

[Market trading at high valuations given rates, economy slowing expectations,;,; I don't want to dive super deep. Right now my portfolio has swapped a few times from short term bonds to stocks and to long term bonds. I bought short term bonds in July and moved to longterm when I saw it hit 5% on longer term yields, then the market dropped along with yields and I swapped to stocks thinking I could average down. The market (QQQ) snapped back up at 375 and I swapped back to short term bonds.  I was looking to move to stocks at some point but the valuations remind me a lot of 2021 where large cap tech lead to oversaturation.   I guess my main question is given my portfolio which is 100% bonds at the moment and up 24.7% for the year, should I just go fully stock or should I stick with my fundamentals and believe that the market isn't priced right (especially large cap tech stocks like NVDA, TSLA, GOOGL, MSFT) and wait for rates to fall (and I expect a slowing US economy)?  Also I would like to hear everyone's thoughts on the value of the us economy, rates and large cap market dominance and whether this is a bull run or just long term stagflation?,;,; 2023-11-20 06:05:52]

[Gallium &amp; Germanium: How will the second half of 2023 play out? Shift in the supply chain imminent?,;,; How would China's recent announcement to limit gallium and germanium export affect chip-making companies? I would argue that it is possible for non-Chinese suppliers like $TECK (Canada) or $UMI (Belgium) to see an increase in production as non-Chinese chip-making companies look to source these precious metals elsewhere. $WOLF saw a 11-12% increase today in their stock price today due to the signing of a new deal for the supply of chip, they also happen to grow their own supply of silicone carbide therefore not having to rely on Chinese suppliers. Might this momentum be enough to follow through into August when Chinese restrictions come into effect?  Perhaps I'm thinking of this the completely wrong way, the latter would be the tensions between the U.S. and China crashing the tech market completely as both do not want the other's involvement in this industry. If so, could this pose a threat to $TSM? (I'm not entirely sure where they source all of their materials from though).  In summary, I would argue that companies to watch out for could be Teck Resources, Umicore and Wolfspeed. Perhaps companies like $NVDA or $QCOM might alter their chip-sourcing partners straying away from Chinese partners and look for companies in the west? Thanks.,;,; 2023-07-05 20:08:13]

[BofA says investors are fleeing tech stocks after ‚ÄòBaby Bubble‚Äô,;,; There are early signs of investors fleeing from tech stocks after a 1999-like rally formed a ‚Äúbaby bubble,‚Äù according to Bank of America Corp.‚Äôs Michael Hartnett.  The technology sector saw $2 billion in outflows, the largest in 10 weeks, in the five trading days through June 21, BofA wrote in a note, citing EPFR Global data. Investors exited with the Nasdaq 100 Index poised for its best half since the last six months of 1999.  The rally in US stocks stalled this week as investors digested Jerome Powell‚Äôs outlook on monetary policy. The Federal Reserve chair said more interest-rate increases may be needed this year, at a time equities have been climbing on hopes that rate hikes would end soon.  Hartnett said that although crowded positioning and strong investor sentiment aren‚Äôt an impediment to the fresh upside, there‚Äôs a bigger chance of a downside than the upside this summer. His team sees a maximum upside of 100-150 points versus a downside of 300 points for the S&amp;P 500 before Labor Day in September.        Hartnett correctly predicted the selloff in stocks in 2022 but has been caught on the wrong side this year with his bearish calls.        Also this week, Chris Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, said the market now resembles the tech boom of 1999 and 2000, which didn‚Äôt end until tighter monetary policy had roiled stocks. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.‚Äôs Marko Kolanovic said US equities are in for a tumultuous second half of the year as the lagging impacts of aggressive monetary tightening by the Fed catch up to the economy.        To be sure, Hartnett said investors are ‚Äústuck in growth stocks,‚Äù like technology, because banks and commercial real estate still ‚Äúhave bad recession vibes, especially in light of renewed central bank hikes.‚Äù        Weekly asset flows highlights from BofA‚Äôs note include:        Among equity regions, US stocks had the first outflow in four weeks at $5.7 billion, Europe had $2.6 billion of redemptions and EM stock funds saw $300 million pulled out. Japan had $2.4 billion in inflows.        By style, US growth had $3.7 billion of outflows versus $200 million of redemptions for US value        For sectors, financials had the biggest inflows while tech and energy had the largest outflows,;,; 2023-06-23 10:50:49]

[Stick with my "Magnificent 7" (well 5) or move to QQQ?,;,; Hey all, I retired recently at age 55 and have been pondering about my investment strategy for the coming years. Specifically, I'm caught between rebalancing my current tech-heavy portfolio, adding AAPL to the mix, or just simplifying life by moving everything into QQQ.   This particular portfolio makes up around 30% of my total retirement savings, and I plan to start drawing it down slowly in about 2 years.        My Current Portfolio      MSFT: \~75%    AMZN: \~9%    NVDA: \~8%    TSLA: \~6%    GOOG: \~1%    Some Context:    I earned my MSFT shares during my career there and am pretty bullish on their future, hence the big slice of the pie they occupy. I added the TSLA in 2016 and sold a few when it had a big gain but again I'm bullish on them. Most of the stocks have been held for at least 3 years.        So, what are your thoughts?        Should I rebalance these existing stocks?    Should I consider adding AAPL to diversify a bit within the tech sector?    Or should I just move it all into QQQ for ease of management?      Just seeking opinions.  &amp;#x200B;  If I don't simplify now I will need to in the coming years. I have a couple of years of cash equivalents available and will rebalance annually.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm not keen to just put it all in in an S&amp;P tracker or whatever as I believe tech will out perform for the foreseeable future. Also much of the rest of my retirement fund is well diversified in managed funds I can't touch yet due to tax/age.        Cheers!        ,;,; 2023-09-11 13:37:17]

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

[Can someone explain to me whether Nvidia can still sustain its insane price right now?,;,; I'm fairly new to stock investing and just so happened to hop onto the AI train early. I only buy/sell stocks and have no idea how to trade options even though I do know how options work.   Anyway I currently have over a whooping $10K earned primarily from Nividia's meteoric rise and I'm legit not sure in how much risky territory I'm now in.  I've read around on reddit for months now that this is gonna be a ticking time bomb about to get dumped but yet  the stock just keeps on rising and rising...   It's been a huge dilemma for me now. Should I still be holding onto Nvidia stock and waiting for their August earnings call? Or just sell off my stocks now for the sake of safety? ,;,; 2023-07-18 19:46:50]

[What are some of the best run companies?,;,; Yesterday there was a post asking which are some of the more poorly run companies, well how about some of the best run companies? Which stand out as having the best management and leadership?      For me, one is $CROX. A premier footwear brand that understands the cyclical nature of footwear and has the manufacturing and distribution side of it down. Their recognition of the brand HEYDUDE led to it‚Äôs acquisition, which is going to provide even further growth opportunities for the company. Execution is everything and they have done so recently. Which companies do you view and greatly operated?,;,; 2023-02-19 14:25:21]
[How Much Is Tesla Worth? You Decide,;,; Wall Street Journal out with an article that lets you plug in 5 simple variables to get a valuation for Tesla.  The 5 variables are: how many cars Tesla sells in 2030, average selling price of a Tesla car in 2030 in today‚Äôs dollars, operating margin, cost of capital, and how much Tesla‚Äôs other operations are worth.  The Wall Street Journal has 4 pre-set scenarios:  1. Bearish - $58.5 billion valuation based on 5 million cars at $30k with 8% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $0 valuation for other operations besides cars  2. Default - $381 billion valuation based on 7 million cars at $30k with 10% margin, 12% cost of capital, and $200 billion valuation for other operations.  3. Bullish - $770 billion valuation based on 10 million cars at $30k with 12% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, $400 billion for other operations  4. Superfan - $2.33 trillion valuation based on 20 million cars at $30k with 15% operating margin, 8% cost of capital, $600 billion for other operations  Their assumptions are as follows:  &gt; Our model is based on estimates of Tesla‚Äôs future cash flows. It multiplies anticipated vehicle sales in 2030 by the average anticipated price to calculate revenue, and then applies the expected operating margin to arrive at operating profit. Estimates for the years before 2030 assume a smooth path in the variables from this year‚Äôs FactSet analyst consensus.  &gt; Operating profit is taxed at an 11% rate (FactSet consensus for Tesla in 2023). Cash flows are then calculated as posttax operating profit minus capital expenditures while adding back depreciation and amortization. Capital expenditures are assumed to be a flat 7% of revenue and depreciation and amortization 20% of capital expenditures.  &gt; Estimated cash flows through 2030 are discounted back to their present value at the discount rate and aggregated. A terminal value is added to account for Tesla‚Äôs cash flows beyond 2030, assuming a steady-state growth rate of 5%. The total of all these discounted estimated cash flows gives the theoretical enterprise value of Tesla‚Äôs core automotive business now.  &gt; We have left the value of its other businesses as a separate assumption within the model to arrive at a total enterprise value. Market value would also include the company‚Äôs cash or debt position, which we have not modeled.  Personally, as a Tesla bull who owns the stock, I believe Tesla is worth north of $1 trillion based on 10 million cars at $38k and 17% operating margin, 10% cost of capital, and $200B for other operations. I also believe that assuming 5% terminal growth post 2030 is too low.   What do you think?  https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/how-much-is-tesla-worth-you-decide-78b25ab1,;,; 2023-09-28 15:06:02]
[McDonald‚Äôs Stock Question,;,; McDonald‚Äôs revenue plumetted for 7 years straight from 2014 to 2021, but the stock roared on for those seven years and more than doubled. How can this be?   This brings me to a deeper question. Is it because McDonald‚Äôs is in so many ETFs and mutual funds?   I did a little research and found that over 43 ETFs hold McDonald‚Äôs in its top 15 holdings.   How were ETF managers so unphased by this? Did they just know that McDonald‚Äôs has such a strong brand name that their investors would be happy to see it included in their ETF no matter how poorly it was performing.   I understand that stock evaluations are often times out of whack with revenue. But this seems like an extreme case.   I am wondering if anyone can explain this disconnect, and would be interested if you think this disconnect is caused by passive investing.,;,; 2024-02-09 23:35:30]
[Microsoft stock?,;,; Microsoft copilot is compatible with Excel and so on. Imagine just telling your GPT-like program to do some task in excel that would normally be tedious. Suddenly your work becomes much faster, so surely you'd wanna buy the microsoft office product for your workforce. Can we expect the microsoft stock to go up with that idea?     Unrelated to the microsoft copilot, but now that microsoft has GPT4 they are probably winning the AI race. Ethics is no concern to them sadly, but that's reality and will speed up any progress. Microsoft is in the perfect position to utilize GPT or similar multivalued AI tools because they control a shitload of other tools/programs/products already so all they have is to integrate the AI with those tools and suddenly you have a bunch of applications  that nobody else in the world has.,;,; 2023-04-01 13:04:46]
[Thoughts on this Strategy: Zombie-Free Indexing,;,; We all know indexing has many advantages. If you aren‚Äôt aware simply google them. One of the main drawbacks is you tend to get the good the bad and the ugly. It drives me nuts knowing my index funds hold/held zombie companies like JCPenny, Macy‚Äôs, GM, airlines, etc when many of these businesses are obviously not good or have tough futures. They exist, but they ain‚Äôt thriving or haven‚Äôt thrived in years.  So I thought, what if i had a basic way to screen out the zombie companies. For me there are a few elements of all businesses that are basically universally good:  Sales are growing, shareholders aren‚Äôt diluted, debt is low, there are healthy gross margins and valuation is reasonable. I use these elements are to develop a ranking system. That‚Äôs it. They can have no or plenty of operating profit, net profit, ROEs, and so on.  Many factor based strategies look for the metrics included above but I feel that is not a great idea. In my view, there are just too many counter examples to focus on ‚Äúfactors‚Äù to make them reliable (AMZN, TSLA, CRM, NOW, etc). Hell a dividend can be interpreted as a sign the company doesn‚Äôt have good investment opportunities. And no operating profits (in the case of AMZN/CRM) were the results of aggressive investments in dominating businesses.  I took this theory and ran it in portfolio123 which has controls for backtesting biases and anecdotally looked into a few companies:  A company like Macy‚Äôs never qualified in the past 20 years.  NVDA first made the cut in 2015 when it was at $5 or $6 (split adjusted)  Kohl‚Äôs never made the cut.  Disney would have made it and been kicked out, PayPal still showing great fundamentals despite it‚Äôs getting obliterated.  I'd love to hear your thoughts and engage in a discussion about this investment strategy. Do you think focusing on the metrics above would lead to a better portfolio in the real world?  Thank you for reading, and I look forward to your insights!,;,; 2023-12-03 02:36:29]

[Not selling in last couple days of year because of taxes,;,; I have a position that I'm considering exiting, but there's a part of me that really wants to wait for 2024, because I won't have to deal with these capital gains on my taxes for this upcoming April. I can worry about it later. It's convenient to worry about it later.  However, I was thinking I might be making a mistake by doing this for two reasons. First, is my overall income going to really be any different next year then this year? If it's likely to be basically the same income, then the tax rate will end up being basically the same, so why not take the hit right now and get it over with?   The second reason, is that if everybody else is thinking like me, and they're waiting for the first week of January to take profits, then wouldn't selling a few days before then be better? Won't all the most frothy stocks get a bit cheaper in the first week of January if a lot of people are doing this?  Also, by the same token, you have the tax loss harvesting that happens in the last couple of days of December. This is usually stocks that are **still** badly beaten down. Because if they had rallied so much, then they wouldn't be "losses". So, think of stuff like PayPal and BABA. Stuff that still hasn't recovered enough.  Anyways, just curious about everybodies thoughts in relation to tax-loss harvesting, selling in early January... and all that other jazz.,;,; 2023-12-25 19:06:15]

[Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..),;,; From https://www.investors.com/news/nasdaq-100-plans-special-rebalance-to-curb-dominance-of-magnificent-seven/    The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the "magnificent seven" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.  The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.  The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to "address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights."  The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.  The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.   How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted? The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.  The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.  The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.  Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.  Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.  Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.  Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.  Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.  How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut? Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.  Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.  The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.  Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023 The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.  This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.  There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.  Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices? The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.  However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&amp;P 500, which is why S&amp;P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.  The S&amp;P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.  Most of the "magnificent 7" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.  The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.  Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.,;,; 2023-07-10 20:25:37]
[It‚Äôs year 2030, what are the world top 5 largest stocks?,;,; My bets, in no particular order: AMAZON, APPLE, MICROSOFT, BERKSHIRE, and COSTCO.   Amazon's growth is impressive, driven by its expanding e-commerce reach in a market that's still not fully tapped. This juggernaut isn't slowing down anytime soon.  Apple's success lies in its thriving ecosystem, especially its booming services like Apple Music, iCloud or Apple TV. Innovations and strong financials keep it at the forefront, not just maintaining but possibly growing its market presence.  Microsoft stands strong with AI and cloud computing innovations. Its financial resilience and predicted growth in these sectors, along with gaming new bet, make it a likely candidate for continued success.  Berkshire Hathaway's diverse investments by one of the world best capital allocators underpin its steady growth. Their strategic planning and financial acumen, along with discussions on future leadership, suggest a stable and prosperous path ahead.  Costco's growth is powered by its expanding membership and strategic global presence. Their operational efficiency and stable financial performance position them well for the future.  I bet you‚Äôll disagree. Love to hear your thoughts.  Happy Holidays.,;,; 2023-12-22 17:10:44]
[How US stocks rose 20% from their lows, and where they might be going,;,; U.S. stocks have defied fears of a recession, a banking crisis and soaring Treasury yields to rise 20% from their October lows - one definition of a bull market.        The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index closed at a low of 3,577.03 on Oct. 12, 2022, down 25% from its all-time high after the Federal Reserve unleashed a series of bruising interest rate increases to fight decades-high inflation.        On Thursday, it closed up 0.6% at 4,293.93, amid growing optimism over the economic outlook and a rate hiking cycle that appears to be nearing its end. Here are some features of the index's rally, and a look at where stocks might go from here.  While markets seldom rise in a straight line, the S&amp;P 500's journey from the bottom took 164 days - the longest 20% climb from a bear market low in five decades. Among the factors holding stocks back was a surge in Treasury yields to their highest levels in decades that dulled the allure of equities by offering investors the potential to earn attractive income in government-backed bonds.        A crisis that saw the biggest bank busts since the Great Recession also shook investor confidence, as did worries over a potentially catastrophic fight over lifting the U.S. debt ceiling.  The narrow breadth of the S&amp;P 500's rally has been a concern for some investors, with just seven stocks - Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) - responsible for almost all of the index's gains this year. Many investors view these stocks as safe bets in uncertain times. Their gains were also driven by excitement over advances in artificial intelligence.  More recently, however, the market's gains have shown tentative signs of broadening out to other stocks.  Meanwhile, volatility has subsided - not only in stocks, but in Treasuries and currencies.        One reason for the calm in markets is investors' belief that the Fed is unlikely to deliver many more of the rate hikes that shook asset prices last year.        Investors have also been encouraged by evidence showing that the U.S. economy continues to be resilient in the face of the central bank's monetary tightening, while inflation slowly cools. The U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (.CESIUSD) shows U.S. economic data has in aggregate topped market expectations, helped by stronger than expected numbers for employment and consumer spending.        A 20% gain from bear market lows has in the past heralded further upside for stocks.  In four of the last six bear markets, the S&amp;P went on to rise 20% or more in the six months after hitting this milestone.

[Advice Request with questions on stocks and broader stock market I thought belong here,;,; I have a few questions about stocks and the broader markets.   Question 1: The stock market in early 2020 slid approximately 35% in less than 3 weeks. Can this ever happen again, say if China invades Taiwan? I am skeptical if this sort of 35% crash can even happen because there are so many people in retirement right now compared to say early 2020. The people who have their pensions, 401(k), IRAs, etc etc directly in the broader market are not going to be pressing sell in good times, bad times or sideways times. For most of them they cannot sell because it is not for them to delegate the funds. This is why I especially do not believe the market really can slide more than say 30%.   Question 2: NVDA was the stock to buy in 2022 into 2023. What is a stock you believe will go up 2X, that is either large or mega cap, between now and 2024 or 2025? If I had to pick a few it would include Roblox, Etsy, Apple, Microsoft and one that could get close to 2X between now and 2025 would be UNH. ,;,; 2023-08-12 02:11:35]

[Stock Market Reactions,;,; So I have been a longtime investor and I find the past two years to be rather fascinating and mildly frustrating and sometimes exciting.  When there is a war - bulls vs bears you never know how the market reacts.  I have seen companies that have beat on revenue and EPS yet get pummeled the very next day.  While in other cases companies that are losing money go exponential.  I find that the markets respond negatively on bad news that more that likely will appear as bounce later on because the stock market has a short term memory.  I also feel that the shorting mentality will keep coming after every significant gain until short fails over and over - example NVDA.  Then there is the stories that go as follows - it was discovered that there were fewer dinosaurs ten million years ago and as a result the crude that is available may not be as plentiful as expected.  Result crude prices go up. People still drive and want their vacations driving demand and jet fuel cost rise impacting profits airline stocks drop, oil company stocks rise and then the new story is correct and it is determined that new was incorrect and the inverse happens.  If the markets reacted to reality instead of a news blip then the makers would be more consistent rather panic buying or selling.  That are so many other aspect that make the stock market impossible sometime!  Thoughts,;,; 2023-10-18 18:50:42]

[What to do with stock based compensation?,;,; Hey guys I was reading over some company filings as earnings season is in effect and I had an accounting question.  Free cash flow is typically found by just taking the operating cash flow and subtracting the general expenses (CAPEX) following all operation activity. However, stock based compensation gets included into operating cash flow activities and therefore adds to the free cash flow total.  This led me to wonder if I should subtract the stock based compensation from the total cash flow as stock based compensation is actually just a non-cash expense of the business and does dilute existing shareholders. This is shockingly significant however as many newer and mostly tech companies generate ridiculous amounts of there cash flow from stock based compensation which is extremely deceptive (ex. ADSK, TEAM, PLTR, NVDA).  This led me to ask if it makes sense to subtract stock based compensation from cash flow , include it in cash flow, or something else.  What do you guys think?,;,; 2023-05-26 00:15:57]

[Microsoft stock hits a record high. Why its next move might be lower,;,; Microsoft stock reached a new all-time closing high‚Äîbut there could be some hiccups ahead in the short term.        Microsoft's stock rose 1.1% to $360.53 on Tuesday. That's a new closing high, topping the previous high of $359.49 set on July 18. Furthermore, Microsoft has won for eight days in a row, its longest winning streak since January 28, 2021.        The stock has been helped by the company‚Äôs strong earnings and sales, which got a boost from the Azure cloud business.        But it‚Äôs not just earnings. Microsoft was already outperforming its peers following tech weakness in August and September. Its stock has gained 15% since the end of September, outpacing Amazon.com (AMZN), which has risen 12%, Meta Platforms (META), which has risen 6.5%, Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), which is up 6%, Alphabet (GOOGL) which has ticked up 0.3%, and Tesla (TSLA), which has dropped 13%.        So, why be concerned? It all comes down to the 14-day relative strength index from Microsoft. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a measure of a stock's or index's momentum, or lack thereof. The closer it comes to 20 on the negative, the more oversold it is, while a score close to 80 indicates that the stock is extremely overbought. A value below 30 usually indicates that a stock is about to rally, while a score above 60 indicates a likely decline. Microsoft's RSI is at 72.75, indicating that it is becoming quite overbought and that a pullback is possible.        That doesn‚Äôt mean Microsoft isn‚Äôt worth buying for its long-term potential. The company has a lot to recommend, including a cloud business that should get a boost as ChatGPT, which held its developer conference yesterday, looks to expand. It just means that investors might get a better opportunity to pick up shares in the days ahead.        ,;,; 2023-11-08 11:35:51]
[Tech stocks have completed their largest three-week surge since the early days of COVID in April 2020.,;,; Tech investors are entering the Thanksgiving season with optimism as the Nasdaq rises 2.4% in a week, marking a 12% gain over three weeks‚Äîthe strongest rally since April 2020. Intel stands out as the week's biggest winner among large-cap tech stocks, surging 13%, driven by robust demand for PCs following better-than-expected profit and sales reports. Mizuho Securities upgraded Intel to a buy rating, citing a renewed focus on the data center business and positive prospects in the customer pipeline.  Next week, the spotlight shifts to semiconductors, with Nvidia set to report results. The stock has surged 22% in three weeks, boasting a year-to-date gain of 237%, outpacing other S&amp;P 500 members. Nvidia's strong performance is attributed to its role in generative artificial intelligence, providing graphics processing units (GPUs) for powerful workloads. Analysts expect revenue growth of over 170% for Q3 and anticipate Nvidia's forecast to suggest close to 200% growth in Q4.  Eric Jackson, founder of EMJ Capital, considers Nvidia his "top large-cap name" and sees the tech market in the early stages of a rebound, linked to the potential end of Federal Reserve rate hikes. The market is sensitive to interest rates, with low costs encouraging risk-taking and higher rates directing investors to safer assets.  Tame U.S. inflation data, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) remaining flat in October, boosts the broader market.

[Taking profits from investments,;,; Update: Will stay the course for now. The tax implications and wanting to keep these stocks longer is not really making me want to sell. Thank you all for the comments and inputs.   ‚Äî‚Äî So I have few stocks that have gone up significantly since I invested in them in 2022. Anyway where between 30- 60% (in $ amount its maybe 17k in profit across these stocks)  Now I am trying to figure what the right strategy is to take the profits out. I dont need the cash and I am in CA so taxes. üòí  But what I am concerned about is what is the strategy here? Do you ‚Äútake‚Äù the profits out when its a certain % or just leave it and forget it. I did that latter part with other stock account I had and after few years lost all the profit and some principal too.   Appreciate any advice.  Edit: snapshot of my portfolio esp stocks with nearly 20% gains. I have lots more with loss too that I want to add to. But for these I am not sure if I should take the profit out or just cont with DCA. When I had the money I added to meta, uber, Meli and Airbnb.

[Should I buy different ETFs depending on the type of account? IRA account vs. Individual Investment account.,;,; My mother recently passed away, and I inherited two Fidelity accounts that she had. One of the accounts was her IRA account. The other was an individual investment account. After taking a look at both of them, I realized that she has a ton of money in bonds. This made sense for someone her age, but for me, I'd like to completely revamp these accounts since I'm 32 years with a much higher risk tolerance.    She also has a ton of different individual stocks (over 70 different individual stocks) that I'd like to consolidate and use mostly ETFs instead. I will post my portfolio plan of action below. My main question is, should I be focusing mainly on ETFs that are dividend driven for the IRA account? While focusing mainly on non-dividend ETFs for my investment account? I know that with IRA accounts, you do not get taxed on dividends as yearly income like you would for investment accounts. I plan on buying the following ETFs for my investment account.   50% VOO (ETF)- Vanguard 500 Index Fund - 500 largest companies.  15% VTI (ETF)- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund - Overall stock market.  10% AVUV (ETF)- Avantis US Small Cap Value -  US small-cap.  10% QQQ (ETF) - Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 - Invesco QQQ - Technology, NASDAQ top 100....Apple, Google, Microsoft, ect.  10% Individual Stocks - NVDA, META, AAPL, AMZN, MCD, TSLA, SHOP, etc.  5% XXUS (ETF)- VXUS-Vanguard Total International Stock ETF - ETF with international exposure.    Should I approach my IRA account any differently? For example instead of these ETFs mentioned above, maybe get more dividend driven ETFs such as SCHD, VYM, SPYD, DGRO, etc?,;,; 2023-09-05 00:05:30]
[Turning 18 and Investing,;,; My dad introduced me to investing at a pretty early age. He agreed that he would give me $100 each month after I proved my investment knowledge to him.  He asked me multiple questions about the economy and finance. I passed his test, and he fulfilled his promise. I hope to be grateful for what he has done in the future.  I started investing with an actual custodial brokerage account at the age of 17, receiving $100 every month. I studied the market the best I could at that time. I was trading weekly, making multiple investments per month (20‚Äì30) and trying to sell at a profit of 2%.  I woke up at 6 am (6:30 was market open) and always looked at chart movement. I was always caught up on any news for stocks and studied from just raw experience. (still do this now)  Right now, as I just turned 18 last month, I have $1320 in my account and am wondering if I should dedicate my money from my internships to "trading weekly" or diversify and lean towards index funds.  My experience with stocks has been ups and downs. I did not allocate and put all my eggs in one basket for multiple trades and allocated over $400 dollars, but then made critical mistakes and lost money during TSLA and NVDA Earnings. I haven't tested options and never will, but I got greedy during the last earnings reports for them and invested 25% of my portfolio in both of the stocks during earnings. I had around $1700 before making these mistakes.  Right now, I am still holding those shares (TSLA has almost recovered), reflecting that I am going to make money from my internships to pursue using that money to trade weekly or open a fidelity account and start investing in index funds like VOO.  You people have more experience than I do, and I'm seeking advice tailored to the future of the account or myself as an investor. Please ask clarifying questions; this is one of my initial posts on reddit, and I probably missed key details.,;,; 2023-11-27 04:46:51]

So considering the situation in Israel I‚Äôm thinking to pull that money out and add 60k more and purchase an apartment in Poland.

[Response to falling bonds: low debt stocks that are recession friendly,;,; With bond yields rising, a company that has high debt has a significant earnings drag.  Rising yields makes new borrowing expensive and kills growth, even when you are diligently releasing new products and retiring old unpopular ones.  Also bond yields rising pushes us toward recession, whether we actually get to recession naturally I don't know, but consumer staples put you in a prepared spot for it.

[The world's wealthiest people have seen their fortunes grow by more than $150 billion thanks to the AI-fueled stock-market boom,;,; * AI-related stocks have seen a spectacular surge in 2023, following ChatGPT's smashing debut.     * Some of the world's wealthiest people have made a killing from the rally.     * Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and Oracle boss Larry Ellison have seen their personal fortunes swell by over $40 billion each.  Artificial intelligence has been one of the defining themes for stocks in 2023 ‚Äì and it's also helping the rich get richer.        The surge in interest in the intelligent language tool ChatGPT quickly spread across markets, with big-name investors rushing to snap up shares in companies they believe could power AI's rise to prominence.        Big Tech giants like Meta Platforms and Nvidia have already racked up triple-digit gains thanks to the AI boom, while Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, and Oracle have also all surged.        That's helped the companies' founders ‚Äì already among the world's richest people at the start of 2023 ‚Äì to become even wealthier.  Meta shares have rallied 134% year-to-date thanks to both the rise of AI and Zuckerberg's so-called "year of efficiency" cost cuts, and that's lifted the Facebook founder's wealth by over $57 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.        Meanwhile, Oracle founder Larry Ellison passed Bill Gates on the publication's rich list for the first time ever earlier this week, with his fortune up $47 billion in 2023 thanks to the tech stock's 55% gain.        Gates himself has gotten $24 billion richer this year thanks to his Microsoft shares, with the Redmond-based tech giant emerging as a preferred AI play for billionaire investors including Stanley Druckenmiller.        And the man at the helm of one of the stock market's biggest success story of 2023 ‚Äì Nvidia founder Jensen Huang ‚Äì has also seen his personal fortune balloon by $24 billion, according to Bloomberg's index.  Again, that's largely thanks to Huang's shares in the chipmaker, which have jumped 192% in value to lift the company to a $1 trillion market capitalization.        The members of the rich list have seen their combined wealth jump by over $150 billion in 2023, by Insider's calculations.,;,; 2023-06-20 06:06:37]

[Seeking Advice on Reallocating Tech Stock Profits to IRA: Long-Term Gains vs. Retirement Planning,;,;   Hey fellow investors,  I've been holding onto tech stocks like Nvidia, Netflix Amazon, Apple, and a few others since 2017, and they've seen impressive returns ranging from 100% to over 1,000%. Currently, I have around $65,000 invested in these stocks on Robinhood.  Considering the incredible gains over the past seven to eight years, I'm contemplating whether it makes sense to sell some of these long-term holdings and redirect the profits into my IRA accounts. My IRAs have a balance of approximately $72,000, and this year, I lack the additional income to contribute to my retirement accounts.  The idea is to potentially diversify by moving some gains from individual tech stocks into more traditional investment vehicles, such as a target retirement fund, total stock market index fund or an S&amp;P 500 tracking fund within my IRA.  I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences on whether reallocating profits from high-performing tech stocks to retirement accounts is a prudent move, considering the current market conditions and the long-term benefits of retirement planning.  For some more context, I'm a 34 year old male with no major debt, I own a house with mortgage payments of about $1600 a month and about 190k in homeowners equity, and I have no car or student loan payments.  Some of my long term tech holdings are as follows:  NVDA - $28,000, 1300% return;  AMZN - $9,000, 137% return;  NFLX - $6,200, 220% return;  AAPL - $14,000, 340% return   I have some more small tech holdings totaling the rest.

[Stocks VS Index and ETFs investing.,;,; I don't have the benefit of time and compounding on my side. What is the benefit of owning individual stocks unless you are trying to beat the market, which even the professionals don't always do according to the stats?

SPY, QQQ, XLE, XLV SCHD DGRO, and  few REITs, like O WPC STAG for a little higher yeild. For some higher beta exposure I'm holding a few like, NVDA, TSLA, GOOG, ETSY, CRM, AMD, BX MS ect, as a smaller part of my portfolio. If I can get average returns of 7-8% over the years, mainly staying in indexes and ETFs, and another 7-8% selling covered calls and cash secured puts on my holdings, who wouldn't be happy with 16% a year?

[Is Wingstop a Meme?,;,; I have some active PUT positions in Wingstop as of about a month ago. The stock hit some reversal points on my indicators, has an overvalued P/E relative to it's industry, and I got food poisoning from it. While it has killed earnings the past four quarters I don't believe it has killed them enough to justify the bullish trend that we are seeing. I just can't comprehend how it has a P/E double that of CMG. Maybe my deep rooted love to Chipotle is biasing me too much.  I am still a newer investor so I'm looking for some more analysis from y'all. Where do we see the stock going moving forward? I just don't understand how it has continued to climb.     EDIT:     Since I'm asking for analysis from y'all I figured I'd share some of my initial research courtesy of GPT:     Comprehensive Analysis and Forecast for Wingstop (NASDAQ: WING)        \*\*Current Performance and Growth Trajectory:\*\*    Wingstop has demonstrated impressive growth and performance in 2023. The company has seen its stock price increase by 89.4% since the start of the year, with shares trading at $260.65. It reported a 46% increase in net income for Q3 2023, reaching $19.5 million, with system-wide sales up 26.5% to $885.0 million. This performance is backed by a strong fundamental story, including a 3-year sales growth rate of 21.6% and a 3-year EPS growth rate of 39.6%.        \*\*Financial Metrics and Valuation:\*\*    Wingstop's EPS for the most recent fiscal year was $2.30, with a trailing P/E ratio of 112.60 and a forward P/E ratio of 107.90. The high P/E ratio suggests that the stock is currently valued at a premium compared to its peers. The net income and net margins stood at $52.95 million and 15.75%, respectively.        \*\*Comparison with Industry Peers:\*\*    Wingstop's main competitors in the "eating places" industry include Aramark, Texas Roadhouse, CAVA Group, among others. Compared to Aramark (ARMK), Wingstop has similar volatility but offers a lower dividend yield. Aramark is also trading at a lower P/E ratio, indicating a more affordable valuation. The P/E ratio of Wingstop is notably higher compared to its peers, which may indicate an overvaluation.        \*\*Market Sentiment and Analysts' Outlook:\*\*    Despite strong performance, analysts' sentiment has slipped to "hold," with a price target lagging the market. The average stock price target is set at $206.32, suggesting a potential downside of -20.3%. Over the previous 90 days, Wingstop's stock had 1 upgrade and 1 downgrade by analysts, with a predicted upside of 8.40% based on their 12-month stock forecasts.        \*\*Technical Analysis and Market Conditions:\*\*    The daily price action chart shows a bearish engulfing pattern, with significant divergence in indicators like MACD and stochastic. These patterns suggest the possibility of a pullback or consolidation phase for Wingstop's stock. The current high valuation and slowing growth rate may contribute to these conditions.        \*\*Institutional Holdings and Market Influence:\*\*    Institutions own nearly 100% of Wingstop's stock, and their actions could significantly influence the stock's future direction. There has been a mixed activity among institutional holdings, suggesting a potential rotation within this group.        \*\*Predictions:\*\*        1. \*\*Short-Term (Next Month):\*\* Given the current overbought conditions and high valuation, a minor correction or consolidation could be expected. However, the stock's strong fundamentals and recent analyst upgrades indicate potential for limited upside. It's advisable to be cautious in the short term due to the potential volatility.        2. \*\*Medium-Term (Next Six Months):\*\* Over the next six months, the market may continue to react to Wingstop's valuation and growth rate. If the company continues to show strong fundamental growth, this could support the stock's high valuation, leading to stable or slightly increased prices. However, any negative earnings reports or shifts in market sentiment could lead to price corrections.        3. \*\*Long-Term (Next Year):\*\* In the long term, Wingstop's growth trajectory and strong fundamentals are likely to support its position as a quality name in the restaurant industry. Although growth is expected to slow down, the company's strategic initiatives and market position could sustain its growth. Investors should monitor for any changes in growth trends or market sentiment that could impact the stock's valuation.        \*\*Conclusion:\*\*    Investors in Wingstop should closely monitor the company's growth and valuation metrics, as well as market sentiment and technical indicators. While the company shows strong fundamentals and growth potential, its high valuation and the potential for market corrections should be considered in investment decisions.,;,; 2023-12-27 17:37:05]

[Why $ENVX gained 27% in the past week,;,; Enovix is a Silicon Valley company creating next gen battery tech that will power technologies of the future, including everything from smart watches to VR goggles and EVs (eventually). How many products can benefit from a better battery?  The company is led by a team of semiconductor industry veterans with tons of experience in scaling manufacturing and growing companies.   The Board is led by TJ Rodgers from $ENPH fame and the board is convinced that creating a better battery is one the next large challenges that tech needs to solve, is prime for disruption, and they are dedicated to take on the challenge.  Enovix has been doing R&amp;D for 10+ years and they are finally ready to start mass producing their batteries.  They have lots of large customers in the pipeline and they just announced a purchase order from a supplier for the US Army which is why the price increased this week.  Investors are waiting for more press releases such as manufacturing updates, additional POs, etc.   The company is pre-profit and the reason I think it‚Äôs a good time to get into it is because they just released their first purchase order, they have a plan to start mass producing by end of 2024, to grow revenue exponentially, to become profitable in less than 3 years, and the general public is not aware of this stock yet.  The stock is currently $18 but has gone as high as $30+ in the past, and has been uptrending since the beginning of this year.  There is chatter in the ENVX community that this stock has the potential to be a NVDA or ENPH type of stock because they have unlimited customers/huge TAM.  Here are some reasons I'm bullish on ENVX (DYOR NFA):  * Compelling use case and understandable product: ENVX offers an innovative, high-performance battery solution designed to power future devices more efficiently, safer, and for longer durations. As someone who prefers to invest in things I understand, this makes sense to me.  * Experienced and accomplished team: ENVX benefits from a team of Silicon Valley veterans who possess deep expertise and a successful track record in the industry. This includes TJ Rodgers from $ENPH as the director of the board.   * Partnerships: ENVX has received PO, interest and secured partnerships with well-known companies, enhancing its credibility and market reach.  * Establishing a moat: ENVX is strategically building a strong competitive advantage through a combination of patents and specialized, custom, and costly equipment necessary for battery production, making it difficult for competitors to replicate their offerings.  * Consistent flow of company news and updates: ENVX consistently communicates important milestones, achievements, and progress, ensuring transparency and fostering investor confidence.  * Active and engaged community: The ENVX community has a strong presence on Twitter and other social media platforms. Might even have the potential to be a Reddit favorite, just like $ENPH is.  * Potential for profitability and mass production within the next 1-2 years: After a decade of R&amp;D, ENVX is now on track to achieve profitability and ramp up mass production in the near future, potentially leading to revenue growth. The old exec team was just replaced this year with a new team with more/better experience.    * Potential for widespread adoption: ENVX's superior battery technology positions them well for mass adoption, given the increasing demand for long-lasting and efficient power solutions in various industries.

[The AI productivity trap: how the 'Blockbuster Effect' may hurt your stock investments,;,; **Summary**   While AI presents vast opportunities for enhancing global economic productivity, it is important to acknowledge that not all companies will thrive or even survive in the face of this revolution. However, it appears that investors are presently embracing an overly optimistic outlook, assuming that virtually every company will automatically reap the rewards of this emerging technology.   We currently live in the so called ‚Äúknowledge economy‚Äù, a system that values intangible assets such as knowledge, intellectual property, and innovation as the primary sources of economic value. Knowledge acts as a potent business moat for established companies, making it challenging for competitors to replicate or access. Thus creating a strong barrier to entry in the market.   The emergence of AI could potentially lead to a "knowledge democratization" phenomenon, gradually dismantling the barriers that currently protect business moats, and thereby impacting the valuations of many popular stocks. This effect, which I refer to as the "Blockbuster effect," entails a scenario where a disruptive technology benefits everyone except those who were initially expected to be the primary beneficiaries of such innovations.     **The actual post**   Over the past decades, the concept of the "knowledge economy" has gained prominence, emphasizing the significance of knowledge generation, acquisition, and utilization in driving economic growth and development. In this transformed economic landscape, the primary source of value has shifted from traditional factors like raw materials and physical labor to intangible assets such as knowledge, intellectual property, and innovation.   Within this context, knowledge can be viewed as a valuable business moat. It represents a company's unique expertise, insights, or intellectual property that are not easily replicated or acquired by competitors, thereby creating a barrier to entry.   Smaller companies and startups often face challenges in competing with larger corporations due to limited financial resources. They may struggle to invest in research and development, hire highly skilled professionals, or acquire advanced technologies, which can hinder their ability to develop and leverage knowledge-based assets. In contrast, larger corporations benefit from well-established networks, partnerships with industry leaders, and research institutions, granting them access to valuable knowledge, market insights, and collaborative opportunities. These advantages strengthen their competitive position.   In my perspective, the modern corporate world is heavily influenced by the monopolization of knowledge. However, AI has the potential to bring about a paradigm shift by democratizing knowledge, which could prove detrimental to many well-established companies. If AI succeeds, it may enable smaller companies to compete with industry leaders in the medium term. In the long term, we might witness a guerrilla war where market leaders contend with numerous small or micro companies.   In this hypothetical scenario, the global economy becomes highly productive, which is undoubtedly beneficial. However, increased productivity does not automatically translate into higher stock valuations, and the opposite may be true for many stocks currently traded. I refer to this phenomenon as the "Blockbuster effect" or the "Blockbusterization" of the economy, in honor of the defunct video rental company that was essentially rendered obsolete by the internet.   During the late 1990s, computers and the internet were introduced as transformative technologies that would reshape the corporate landscape and enhance productivity, which indeed happened. The democratization of information brought about significant societal and economic changes. While many existing companies benefited greatly from this revolution, others became redundant or remained as struggling entities awaiting the next downturn.   Blockbuster serves as a notable example. The internet greatly enhanced the productivity of the entertainment industry, benefiting society at large. However, it also swiftly eradicated Blockbuster's core assets and competitive advantages. For instance, Blockbuster had an extensive network of exclusive movie rental deals with major producers such as Warner Bros., Disney, and Paramount, which ensured early access to popular titles and fostered customer loyalty. However, with the rise of streaming platforms, many of these partners established their own direct channels, rendering Blockbuster's exclusive deals irrelevant. Other once-relevant moats, such as well-located stores and an extensive movie catalog, also lost their significance.   Blockbuster stock performed quite well during the dot-com bubble and reached its all-time high in early 2002. Investors seemingly believed that Blockbuster could leverage its dominant market position and embrace the wonders of computers and the internet at the core of its business. However, it is unclear why they were so optimistic, considering that Blockbuster primarily served as an intermediary between studios and consumers, lacking distinctiveness beyond physical rentals. Investors seemingly failed to distinguish between the broader societal and economic impacts of technology and its specific implications for their investment.    While Blockbuster is a prominent example, countless lesser-known companies and entire industries faced similar fates. The internet revolutionized entire layers of intermediaries that existed before personal computers and the internet.   In my viewpoint, there seems to be a pervasive tendency to haphazardly incorporate the potential productivity gains driven by AI into the valuations of every company. This mirrors the past mistake made by Blockbuster's investors, who assumed that the mere greatness of a new technology for society and the overall economy would guarantee its benefits for their favored stocks or indices.   Furthermore, it is crucial to delve into related matters that surpass the scope of this discussion. For instance, it is worth examining why there is a widespread belief that the "Magnificent Seven Stocks" will inevitably derive substantial benefits from, or even survive, the AI revolution. Additionally, one should consider the possibility that the true victors of the AI revolution have yet to emerge, transcending existing players in the market.     **My advice for the future**   Right now we are getting bombarded with AI hype, FOMO and 90s like irrational exuberance, my advice can be summed up as follows.     1-Exercise prudence when factoring in prospective productivity improvements into the current market leaders. This task is intricate and carries a considerable risk of filling your portfolio with overvalued stocks.   2-Maintain an open-minded approach, acknowledging the possibility that many present-day market leaders could face redundancy or obsolescence in the medium or even near future, despite the overall stability of the economy and markets.    3-Don't let AI distract you from important macroeconomic trends happening in the present hoping the irruption of AI changes it all. Same happened in the dot com era, people talked about this ‚Äúnew era‚Äù where even basic stuff like P/E ratios or the yield curve inversion were no longer relevant, but it was. God knows it was. ,;,; 2023-06-24 15:33:49]

[How A.I. might improve IT service margins. Here a few stocks on my watchlist.,;,; Typically, IT services tend to be a very boring industry. There are a lot of sleeper stocks that compound capital with good cash flows. Nothing exciting happens here. They charge a premium to install software for clients in most cases. So naturally, investors tend to look for higher-margin software stocks.  But a few months ago, I remember hearing Chamath mention the impact of A.I. on IT outsourcing. And I don't think this idea has been revisited much. (I know the All-In ideas are controversial but this might be interesting to pick apart.)  First, we're familiar with the big names like IBM, Infosys and Accenture $IBM $INFY $ACN.        Infosys and IBM have mid-teen profit margins with +30% returns on equity. Cognizant $CTSH and Accenture are similar. However  I think the market underappreciates smaller players like TaskUs $TASK and RCM $RCMT. Both offer tech outsourcing in different verticals.        TaskUs focuses on content moderation and security. RCM in specialty healthcare and engineering. RCMT is delivering 56% on equity with improving margins after the CEO turned the stock around.        Now I don't think A.I. is priced in most of these IT service stocks. Both as a competitive advantage and disruptor. First up, the big names wont see much margin changes. But mid cap stocks like $CNXN $UIS $CDW might see further margin compression. Making those stocks painful to hold.   But TaskUs has a younger executive team with the cofounders still onboard. They caught the social media content wave early on and outsourced a lot of work to the Philippines. Trust &amp; Safety was a big win for them. They also work in unique verticals like gaming.  I don't think they will pivot to software. But I do think the net profit margins can go beyond 4-5%. A 7% net profit margin is possible if they replace some talent with A.I. software. A 2-3% uptick doesn't seem like much but it's 40-50% higher than their current take rate. The stock price can reflect these margin improvements over the next 2-3 years. It will be slow but profitable.  Other names worth looking into are EPAM Systems $EPAM, Exlservice $EXLS and Genpact $G. All have more focused leadership with good historical performance.     ,;,; 2024-01-23 04:39:09]
[These are the stocks on my watchlist (1/17) :D,;,;         No positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers)    To clarify since I've been asked: I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel: they're just my perspective of where a stock could potentially go. Percentages signify what the stock is trading at when I write up the report and are NOT predictions of stock price EOD. Some of the stocks I post are &lt;$500M market cap and are NOT good long-term investments, but are good candidates to day trade.        **JBLU/SAVE,** liquidity 9/10- We saw SAVE make a MASSIVE, 60%+ move to the downside after the merger was rejected. We could see this fall further, because there really is no path to profitability for SAVE at this point. Hesitant about playing this for a long-term bounce, more interested in short-term day trades. Multiple down-grades on SAVE because of failure of merger.        **NVDA**, liquidity 8/10- Broke all times highs AGAIN- still short a small starter position from Thursday, but will possibly get out. Still watching this seeing the recent spike up/down. Added to small short this morning but not extremely confident this will move as intended.    BFRG, liquidity 8/10- Collaboration with lab for brain development has potentially ‚Äúground-breaking data‚Äù. Pretty badly written fluff headline but I expect this to move, liquidity is solid.        **TSP**, liquidity 5/10- Going to be delisted off the NASDAQ, likely going to happen. Low market cap, crappy stock, but might play lightly if the move gets huge/volume comes in.         **SLDP**, liquidity 8/10- Solid Power and SK have three new agreements, seeing steady move downwards after initial pop. Worth playing if move becomes larger ($1 level potentially).             Standing tickers    **RIOT/MARA/COIN/BITO/IBIT/HOOD/GBTC -** Worth watching proxies off the open for order flow moves (will remove this when moves no longer get larger).     **JNPR**, liquidity 9/10 ‚Äì HPE confirmed to buy JNPR at $40/cash, just leaving this on here for people to be aware, or if you want to play the merger arb.    ,;,; 2024-01-17 14:51:29]
[The Semiconductor/Chip Bubble,;,;  Hi everyone,  I want to start by clarifying that this is ***not*** financial advice.  I believe that there is a semiconductor bubble that is anywhere between 2 to 3 quarters from popping.  A combination of growing recession, war, supply chain, and decreasing demand pressures exasperated by overvaluation in the chip space is a ticking time bomb.  # Let's start by reviewing the decreasing demand for semiconductors...  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;WASHINGTON‚ÄîApril 6, 2023‚ÄîThe Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today announced global semiconductor industry sales totaled $39.7 billion during the month of February 2023, a decrease of 4.0% compared to the January 2023 total of $41.3 billion and 20.7% less than the February 2022 total of $50.0 billion. Monthly sales are compiled by the¬†[World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS) organization](https://www.wsts.org/)¬†and represent a three-month moving average. SIA represents 99% of the U.S. semiconductor industry by revenue and nearly two-thirds of non-U.S. chip firms.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Regionally, year-to-year sales increased slightly in February in Japan (1.2%), but decreased in Europe (-0.9%), the Americas (-14.8%), Asia Pacific/All Other (-22.1%), and China (-34.2%). Month-to-month sales were down across all regions: Europe (-0.3%), Japan (-0.3%), Asia Pacific/All Other (-3.6%), the Americas (-5.3%), and China (-5.9%).  **Souce:** [https://www.semiconductors.org/global-semiconductor-sales-decrease-4-month-to-month-in-february/](https://www.semiconductors.org/global-semiconductor-sales-decrease-4-month-to-month-in-february/)  The bottleneck for semiconductors seems to have certainly passed, and I would expect to see the balance sheet for semiconductor and chip manufacturers to begin contracting.  # Moving onto war and legislative pressures, I believe that this industry has tremendous exposure to China &amp; Taiwan...  TSMC is the largest producer of semiconductors, virtually all other chip manufacturers rely on TSMC to produce their semiconductors. Additionally, outside of TSMC, many chip manufacturers rely on China for at least part of their chip manufacturing or assembly as well.  I believe that the growing conflict between China and Taiwan may be approaching a tipping point.  Although tensions have been high between Taiwan and China for sometime, a recent Quiver Quant Instagram reel outlines some suspicious trading behavior from Senator Tommy Tuberville as well as Warren Buffet regarding TSMC.  Reel: [https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cq89p-1ggyM/?utm\_source=ig\_web\_copy\_link](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cq89p-1ggyM/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)  Yahoo Finance Article on Buffet TSM Sale: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-says-unusually-quick-002444050.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-says-unusually-quick-002444050.html)  Quiver Quant Page on TSM Trades: [https://www.quiverquant.com/dashboard/TSM/](https://www.quiverquant.com/dashboard/TSM/)  I believe that this conflict will create a huge supply chain issues for chip manufacturers. I believe it will be a delayed issue, meaning that we won't see the issue manifest for at least a quarter or two on earnings, and I would not be surprised if their first earnings following the conflict is actually stronger, but their forward guidance becomes incredibly poor.  Adding to the bottleneck they may be experiencing with semiconductors, I believe that OPECs decision to reduce oil production will also manifest itself as additional operating costs for the chip manufacturers. The cost to import parts will increase and henceforth their operating cost as well.  Here in the U.S, I believe this will be a stark contrast for us month to month. The government has been able to artificially suppress crude oil prices by dipping into the the national reserve, however, this is not sustainable long term. Once this stops, we'll see a big jump from moderate to high inflation in a matter of days and this will likely shock our economy quite a bit.   [https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/sarabia-other-opec-producers-announce-voluntary-oil-output-cuts-2023-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/sarabia-other-opec-producers-announce-voluntary-oil-output-cuts-2023-04-02/)  # Overvaluation...  I'm specifically taking aim at NVDA. They have a book value of approximately $8.96 but closed the trading day on 4/14/23 at $267.58  That is 29.86x their book value. YTD their stock price has risen 80.18% while their actual book value has dropped from $10.62 to $8.96 YOY from Q4 of 2021 to Q4 of 2022.  To contrast, TSM's price-to-book ratio is 4.72 as of 4/14/23.  AMD's P2B value is 2.70, and just for fun, TSLA's is 13.09  Obviously when we look at the actual price of a stock, we understand that a large degree of a stock's price is speculation. I'm arguing that the speculation in NVDA's stock price is out of control, and that at some point it will return to a more reasonable price-to-book ratio.  I believe in this case, the conflict between Taiwan and China will be the catalyst that will accelerate NVDA's waterfall down into a more reasonable price point.  Positions  $TSM Short  $YANG Long  $SOXS Long  $UVXY Long  I do believe that after this bubble bursts, we're going to form another bubble, so I'll be looking to reverse my positions at some point.  Specifically I will be looking at INTC and MSFT to lead the next bubble in this sector given their foray into semiconductor manufacturing.,;,; 2023-04-30 19:22:08]
[Is it time for Micron puts,;,; I have been looking for a play recently since I‚Äôm flush with cash after selling a few plays. I‚Äôve been better at being patient and was really close to buying micron puts at close yesterday. This morning I almost had didn‚Äôt buy it remorse when I saw Lenevo has instructed internal buyers and sub tiers to stop using micron memory. The stock instantly dropped 2% and I thought I missed my chance (also trying to not chase plays). But now it‚Äôs back to positive territory. Part of my thesis yesterday was that the China ban was being under appreciated since what China says and what it does or usually two different things. The fake reason is just for domestic consumption and we investors should see this coming that they would ban micron in a much wider swathe of products then they claimed. Add this that micron is trading in a range it was swinging in for a large chunk of 2021 when it was earning over 2$ a share instead of losing 2$ a share. Memory glut hit them hard, consumption of memory products is way down and this headwind means micron isn‚Äôt bottomed out yet. This applies more pressure as supply chains can use this to further put price pressure on micron products. The stock just rode nvda earnings to plus 5%. What do you all think.

[Exclusive: Nvidia pursues $30 billion custom chip opportunity with new unit -sources,;,; https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-chases-30-billion-custom-chip-market-with-new-unit-sources-2024-02-09/       SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for cloud computing firms and others, including advanced artificial intelligence (AI) processors, nine sources familiar with its plans told Reuters.  The dominant global designer and supplier of AI chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market for custom AI chips and shield itself from the growing number of companies pursuing alternatives to its products.  The Santa Clara, California-based company controls about 80% of high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock market value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023.  Nvidia's customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT.O), opens new tab, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab and Meta Platforms (META.O), opens new tab, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of its chips to compete in the fast-emerging generative AI sector.  Its H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time to design.  Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to rival firms such as Broadcom (AVGO.O), opens new tab and Marvell Technology (MRVL.O), opens new tab, said the sources, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  "If you're really trying to optimize on things like power, or optimize on cost for your application, you can't afford to go drop an H100 or A100 in there," Greg Reichow, general partner at venture capital firm Eclipse Ventures said in an interview. "You want to have the exact right mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need."  Nvidia does not disclose H100 prices, which are higher than for the prior-generation A100, but each chip can sell for $16,000 to $100,000 depending on volume and other factors. Meta plans to bring its total stock to 350,000 H100s this year. Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon.com (AMZN.O), opens new tab, Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for them, two sources familiar with the meetings said. Beyond data center chips, Nvidia has pursued telecom, automotive and video game customers.  Nvidia shares rose 2.75% after the Reuters report, helping lift chip stocks overall. Marvell shares dropped 2.78%.  In 2022, Nvidia said it would let third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking technology with their own chips. It has said nothing about the program since, and Reuters is reporting its wider ambitions for the first time. A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company's 2022 announcement.  Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), opens new tab and Marvell executive, heads Nvidia's custom unit and her team's goal is to make its technology available for customers in cloud, 5G wireless, video games and automotives, a LinkedIn profile said. Those mentions were scrubbed and her title changed after Reuters sought comment from Nvidia.  Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment.     **$30 BILLION MARKET**  According to estimates from research firm 650 Group‚Äôs Alan Weckel, the data center custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year, and double that in 2025.  The broader custom chip market was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023, which amounts to roughly 5% of annual global chip sales, according to Needham analyst Charles Shi.  Currently, custom silicon design for data centers is dominated by Broadcom and Marvell.  In a typical arrangement, a design partner such as Nvidia would offer intellectual property and technology, but leave the chip fabrication, packaging and additional steps to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330.TW), opens new tab or another contract chip manufacturer.  Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales.  "With Broadcom's custom silicon business touching $10 billion, and Marvell‚Äôs around $2 billion, this is a real threat," said Dylan Patel, founder of silicon research group SemiAnalysis. "It's a real big negative - there's more competition entering the fray."  **BEYOND AI**  Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson (ERICb.ST), opens new tab for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics processing unit (GPU) technology, two sources familiar with the discussions said. Ericsson declined to comment.  650 Group's Weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year. Nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video game markets, according to sources and public social media postings.  Weckel expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6 billion to $8 billion range at 20% a year, and the $7 billion to $8 billion video game custom chip market could increase with the next-generation consoles from Xbox and Sony (6857.T), opens new tab.  Nintendo's current Switch handheld console already includes Nvidia's Tegra X1 chip. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is likely to include a Nvidia custom design, one source said.  Nintendo declined to comment.,;,; 2024-02-09 23:15:02]

[Looking for niche industries with dominant players/brand loyalty.,;,; Greetings. I'm seeking to source ideas from the wisdom of the crowd. Following a Peter Lynch approach, I've been exploring niche or premium/luxury industries with 1-2 dominant players due to industry consolidation and brand loyalty. The fewer competitors, the better. Let me provide some examples:     * **Nvidia (Prior to AI/Crypto boom):** Before entering the spotlight, Nvidia was in a niche industry (GPUs for PC gaming) with little competition and selling products that could be considered in an enthusiast/premium-tier.  * **Garmin (GRMN):** Garmin holds a robust position in the niche sport watches segment, boasting around 40% market share (but facing fierce competition at the macro level). They offer premium products and enjoy significant brand loyalty. * **Shimano (7309):** I think in categories beyond entry-level; all the bicycle manufacturers/designers use Shimano and SRAM parts. Recently started in the hobby but I have the impression that having Shimano component could make-or-break a sale.   Other (not validated) ideas: OLED (as OLED technology it¬¥s getting mainstream), CUERVO (Tequila industry), perhaps Herman Miller and Steelcase in the premium office chair segment?, Dolby (audio technology) and potentially Sonos in the future.

[Changes in this sub/cash on the sidelines = bullish for growth stocks?,;,; I started investing during the height of the 2021 bubble. I didn't know a lot so, thank God I was smart enough to slowly ease into the market. I quickly found this sub and came to know the tickers that people were excited about - a lot of ASML, NVDA, AMD, SOFI, ZOOM, PYPL, TSLA, SNOW, SHOP - and a host of ARKK stocks at the very top.  Well, since the bubble burst and these stocks either came back to Earth - or worse - crashed fantastically, I've noticed that growth stocks are kind of rarely mentioned around here outside of the big tech giants, some of which represent more value than growth.  Outside of a few, the high-fliers are dead. I haven't heard a peep about ASML or, say, SOFI, or cybersecurity stocks in a while. Yet, under the surface, a lot of growth stocks have absolutely sky-rocketed from the bottom or, conversely, are still hovering around 52 week lows.  My points to you all are two-fold:  1. Many retail investors - especially the ones excited about growth stocks - have been wiped out of the market. There's little excitement left for these stocks and, in my view, that's bullish. It means there's been a serious de-risking. There are people who contend that the worst is yet to come and that we've seen nothing yet - but I'd argue that the hyper-growth side of the market has already experienced it's 2001-style reckoning. I really don't have conviction that there isn't more pain to come, but it seems to me that it's time to start seriously scrutinizing these companies to find the very best ones. 2. There is an absolute fuck-ton of money in money-markets, T-bills, and cash. People are bearish. I know we've just experienced quite a rally through Q1 but there are *still* many, many growth stocks that are down very low. We've had some very bad news recently with OPEC, bad jobs numbers, SVB, but - at some point - the market will begin looking past these things and start looking ahead. You could get in when it's more clear that conditions are improving - likely the safer bet - or you could start really digging to find potential value in the broken dreams of 2022 to catch the most upside.  I personally was never interested in the vast majority of stocks regularly brought up in this sub; I like to focus on semiconductors, and mostly not the names mentioned here. That being said, I'm seeing some tickers that are beginning to pique my interest: SOFI, DDOG, ENPH, WOLF, INVZ, CRWD, are a few. I've only opened small positions in a few of these because I'm a pretty cautious investor, but I'll be looking to add if entry points become even more attractive.  In sum, I contend that it might be time start getting excited for hyper-growth again during a time where it seems like everybody hates these stocks and there's a ton of money parked in cash. I'd be curious to see what people think.,;,; 2023-04-06 06:56:28]

[STMicroelectronics (STM) is one of the best and most undervalued European stocks,;,; I'll preface this by saying I'm just an amateur retail investor and I'm self-taught so please be gentle in case I have misunderstood something. Here goes.  STMicroelectronics (STM) is the best and one of the most undervalued European stocks in my opinion. If you look at valuation, their potential and current numbers it's insane. Honestly I think you could make your money several times over with this one (3x, 4x bagger potentially) in the the medium-term.  STM makes chips for automotive, energy, industrial mainly, plus personal electronics, sensors and that kind of thing (so not CPUs or GPUs like NVDA or Intel or whatever, instead their competitors are ON Semi, Infineon, etc.). Among their clients you can find Apple, Tesla, Google, META, SpaceX, Huawei, Stellantis, BYD, BMW, Airbus + a myriad of others. They are the main chip supplier of some of these companies.  First things first, valuation is really super low. STM typically traded around 15-25 PE in the years before and since the pandemic (around 16 PE in 2021, and 24 in 2020-21), which is more or less typical for the sector. It's now been less than 10PE (going as low as 7) for like a year (as of writing this post it is around 9), and the stock was shorted to death throughout 2022 and even parts of 2023. Looking at the whole picture (zoom out on the chart) its price has really gone nowhere despite the fact they grew revenues and profits 20% over 2022, and those profits and revenue levels have proven quite resilient throughout 2023. They've had gross margins close to 50% for the past couple of years essentially. How can one explain this? From my limited knowledge of the industry, I think a lot of people (most analysts) thought their margins would collapse back down, because for over 10-15 years (before the pandemic) the chips STM made were effectively bought &amp; sold as commodities and were very cheap (STM had really low margins over this period). Everyone thought that the new 40%+ gross margins STM was achieving during and right after the pandemic were a fluke and that STM would go back to having its old terrible margins once things calmed down. Right now, it looks like that thesis is proving to be wrong and the new margins STM is achieving and everything else is basically holding up. They have pricing power now.  Automotive is their main segment nowadays (as well as their most profitable) and even in the current "EV slowdown" they are expecting 30% y-o-y growth for that segment. Their second most significant segment is the personal electronics/PC market, which seems to be turning a corner already after a long period of inventory correction (from which they seem to be coming out of basically unscathed, I saw Samsung is planning to increase prices soon on many of their sensors, which STM also makes, it looks like a positive sign to me regarding demand in the sector). Currently, their third main segment is the industrial market which is their most shakey segment at the minute but even that looks like it may just basically hold up more or less where it currently is.  A few things to note for investors, they don't "reward" shareholders with a lot of buybacks or dividends currently because their deal is that they re-invest 75% of their cash flow into new fabs (4bn net CapEx this year for example, plus they are getting a ton of subsidies in the context of reshoring chip production in Europe, etc.), focusing on increasing the company's fundamental value in that way. They have a stated objective of 20bn revenue for 2025-2027 with 50% gross margin.  Currently their net margin is around 27-30%. They were at 15bn yearly revenue in 2022 and this year will end up around 17bn total revenue. If they get more efficient as the new fabs ramp-up, which is always the case in the industry as I understand, I can see their margins holding up and them reaching their stated objectives in 2025-2026 depending on the macro picture. They are perfectly positioned for the major transitions the whole world is driving to (transport electrification, edge AI, industrial automation, renewable energy, etc.)  Here are some stats based on the last 12 months: Gross margin TTM 47.21% Operating margin TTM 29.4% Net Profit margin TTM 27.23% Return on Investment TTM 28.1%  Their current net cash position is around 2.5bn, reflecting liquidity of 5bn and total debt of 2.5bn. Over the last 4 quarters, they have had revenues between 4.2bn and 4.5bn per quarter, achieving 1bn+ net income in each quarter (which they are re-investing massively in expanding the company as mentioned above).  I have been following this stock for a couple of years at this point and it has been baffling to me how it hasn't taken off much more than this. I get it that it's the CAC40 and not the S&amp;P or Nasdaq, but still they have an ADR and honestly I can see STM becoming one the main and most well-known European stocks in the near-future once the new business cycle really takes off (possibly sooner than later at this point?).,;,; 2023-12-03 10:24:14]
[Nvidia covered calls thoughts,;,; I have been writing covered calls on a few of my bigger positions for a while.  Nvidia has been an interesting one because of the volatility and the range it trades in.    Looking tonight, the June $550 call is $5k right now, which is about 9.6%.  Its a long time out for a call but with a premium that high, I dont lose upside until after $600 and I get that money to expand some other positions.  Wondering what the thoughts are on writing calls that far out?,;,; 2024-01-09 03:44:19]
[Dumb Mistake Selling NVIDIA Covered Calls,;,; Looking back I made a bad choice of selling NVIDIA covered calls at a strike price of 170 expiring Jan 2024. This was last November when NVIDIA was still priced at 130 or so. At the time, it seemed like a reasonable valuation. Now the stock is 380 after hours, and I'm not sure what to do. Should I roll this farther out and wait for the hype to settle down to a reasonable valuation? The only consolation is that I technically still own the stock and can roll them forever or until assigned, but it just wouldn't be liquid.  For some extra context, this was around the time the company I was going to join after graduation shut down, tech hiring was a disaster, and I was relying on these covered calls to live off of.,;,; 2023-05-24 22:47:48]
[Effect of NVIDIA earnings call on the rest of the market,;,; This is a rather simple question.

[Feel like I screwed up.. Should I sell AMD call before Nvidia report next week?,;,; I was riding high after my first successful SPY options calls were 3/3, so I bought AMD call at a high this week after hearing news about their new chip launch on NPR. I should have checked the history.. it‚Äôs barely reached $180 before. I‚Äôm down 37.9% üìâ. I have hope the Nvidia report next Wednesday could boost it over the line but think the smarter move would be to sell on the morning of on Wednesday or Tuesday in case the report is meh. Thoughts?

[Should I do the Wheel on SPY, QQQ or Nvidia?,;,; I've been doing the wheel strategy right now with AMD. Doing weeklies staying below .3 delta and it's been good but looking to get into something with higher premiums.  I have about 45k to play with so I was torn between these three options. Nvidia premiums have been really high lately but I don't think that will last. SPY seems to be the the safer bet and not sure on QQQ.  Also, on ETF options do you guys still do weeklies or do you prefer dailies/monthlies? ,;,; 2023-09-21 12:50:53]

[Nvidia Expected Move / Earnings Preview,;,; Stocks begin the day slightly in the green but there are some wild swings in companies that just reported. With PTON down 30%, Foot Locker down 30%, and Abercrombie up 15%. Those were all significantly larger moves than options were pricing.  Of course, the big event of the day is Nvidia NVDA earnings after the close. At the moment, options are pricing about a 9.5% move. Recent earnings have seen actual moves of +25%, +14%, -1%, and +4%. In other words, options are pricing a smaller move than the past two events, which have both seen significantly larger moves. Options expiring Friday have implied vol of about 134, while 30-day IV is around 66.  Since that +25% earnings move in May the stock has remained volatile, but with a 16-17% range since early June. The stock is just shy of its all-time high, with the upper expected move around the big round number of $500, while the lower expected move sits at levels where the stock has bounced twice this summer:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/97hfkzpy4vjb1.png?width=813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ead1c5ab30f70c6dff2decb0653b065f7819c3a6  In other words, options sellers would be hoping the stock held that support if the company disappoints, and found sellers at a big fat number of $500, which would be a new all-time high. One thing to look for in situations like that is if there's open the interest around a round number like $500. And in this case, there is, with the 500 line having significantly more open interest than anything around it, with similar open interest as the near-the-money 450 strike:  https://preview.redd.it/tu1g15xd6vjb1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daf65faf582d3d0429219727507cdb0f1db4feee  That's not a ton to rest your hat on as resistance, but it's something, potential gamma. Therefore, the expected move levels have some reasoning behind them at the moment and may help explain why the expected move is so much less than the past two events. Option buyers of course should be aware of those levels and perhaps look to debit spread to those levels.  As far as how the stock has been moving recently, it's been volatile, but the 30 day actual vol of 49 is in line with how the stock has moved the past year.

[Expected moves this week: FOMC Minutes, Zoom, Nvidia and more.,;,; Stocks had another stong week, finishing higher by about 2.3% Both SPX and SPY got stuck in the mud for the final 3 days of last week as they reached a heavy open interest level of 450/4500 and the gamma took effect, essentially pinning the indices to that level as November monthly options approached expiry. With those monthly options expired the backdrop changes into this week, but it also happens to be a shortened Thanksgiving week. Therefore, options are pricing a small move, a bit less than 1% into Friday. It's possible that gamma get re-established at the same level but it is unlikely we see that sort of gamma pinning we saw last week as the effect won't be as robust to start a new option calendar month.  The big economic data of the week comes on Tuesday with the release of the FOMC minutes. Fed watchers' attention turns now from rate hikes, with the assumption those are now over, to any signs of cracks in the economy which could allow the FOMC to begin cutting rates in 2024. As of now Fed fund futures give a small chance of a rate cut by March with a strong chance of one happening by May. That's something to keep an eye on as talk of rate cuts would likely coincide with worries about an economic cooldown. That table has not turned yet but it could become the focus into year end.

[Expected Moves this Week: SPY, QQQ, Nvidia, Apple, Costco, Nike, Micron and more.,;,; Last week saw a pop in volatility and several down days following the FOMC announcement. SPY finished the week down 2.9%, nearly 3x the move options were pricing. The VIX closed on Thursday Sept 14th below 13, into a Sept 15th triple witching expiry that saw the expiration of alot of gamma that may have been keeping a lid on market volatility while some bad news piled up. Once that gamma got unwound/expired implied vol began ticking up into the FOMC meeting and then even higher with stocks going lower out of the meeting.   The VIX is now above 17, still slightly below its historical mean but now matching its highest levels since late May. In other words, the low vol, slow grind higher we saw over the entire summer looks to have come to an end, at least for now, with September expiration. Keep an eye on both weekly IV as well as 30-60 day IV as both got very low into that Sept 15th expiry. Stocks that had seen a slow grind higher all Summer were suddenly making large moves in the span of days or weeks that options weren't pricing to happen in the span of multiple months in the future.   For traders, it's helpful to look at recent stock moves and compare to the expected move in the future to see instinctually if options are inexpensive out in the future. Just as an example, NVDA has made several 15% moves in the past month, yet options are not pricing that sort of move to happen again until December expiry:  https://preview.redd.it/ga156iq9i8qb1.png?width=806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=deef6e981dc525ff4abdf70c04272cdf0eb39f1a  And Apple has made several moves in the 8-10% range recently, yet options aren't pricing a 10% move until well into the beginning of 2024:     https://preview.redd.it/w72vsxu8i8qb1.png?width=826&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d55c0113ee3780eea6c3efc9d40b5df1b8a249cc  There's no guarantee the volatility will continue, it could stop on a dime again. But, options clearly are still in a hangover from the low vol days of Summer and are still playing catch-up. The weeklies have made the biggest spike so far, now pricing in expected moves about 50% higher than just a few weeks ago.

There's also Jackson Hole central banker speak, highlighted by Jay Powell on Friday. IV has picked up recently a bit but still remains slightly below historical averages.

The VIX got within sniffing distance of 19 last week, a level it hasn't seen since the Spring.

[Expected Moves this Week: GDP, Fed Minutes. Earnings From Nvidia, Walmart, Carvana, Coinbase more.,;,; ## Market View  **Last Week ‚Äì SPY holding a tight range for Feb, so far.**  SPY traded in about a 2.5% range and finished more or less unchanged on the week. That was versus options that were pricing about a 2.2% move for the week. In fact, the SPX has traded in a fairly tight 3% range for February so far. That‚Äôs despite a slew of important economic releases and volatile earnings announcements that could have been market-moving. Implied volatility remains on the lower end of the option premium prices we‚Äôve seen over the past year. The VIX got as low as 18 following the CPI release but closed the week back above 21. The market saw a bounce on Friday that kept it from falling below that February range, a move that would have seen IV spike a bit.  **This Week ‚Äì Downside level of February range one to watch for IV.**  SPY options are pricing about a 1.5% move for the holiday-shortened week. The $404.50 level that SPY tested on Friday is one to watch as moves lower than that low end of the recent range could see put protection buying and higher IV. The FOMC minutes on Wednesday and the GDP print on Thursday are ones to watch on the economic calendar.

Expected move, weekly IV, and prior earnings moves (starting with most recent).  As mentioned in recent weeks, although the overall market IV is on the low end of what we‚Äôve seen the past year, there are some large idiosyncratic moves happening in single stock names. particularly stocks that saw large declines in 2022, as the potential for large percentage moves from a low stock price can sometimes be difficult for options to price. Carvana is a good example below, it‚Äôs seen moves of 40% in its last two earnings, with options trying to price the possibility of a move like that, or the chance of it not moving at all, and seemingly splitting the difference with an expected move of around 24%. The stock is just $11 now and has seen a high of over $18 and a low near $10 this month alone. Massive percentage moves that are difficult for the options market to price as the straddles to account for the potential of a stock doubling would be nearly the entire stock price to zero on the downside.  &amp;#x200B;  **Tuesday**  * **Walmart** WMT /¬†**Expected Move:¬†4.0%**¬†/ Recent moves: +7%, +5%, -11% * **Home Depot** HD /¬†**Expected Move:¬†3.8%**¬†/ Recent moves: +2%, +4%, +2% * **Coinbase** COIN /¬†**Expected Move:¬†16.5%**¬†/ Recent moves: +5%, +7%, -26%, -2% * **Palo Alto Networks** PANW /¬†**Expected Move:¬†6.6%**¬†/ Recent moves: +7%, +12%, +10%, +1%  **Wednesday**  * **Baidu** BIDU /¬†**Expected Move:¬†6.4%**¬†/ Recent moves: +1%, -7%, +14, +7% * **Nvidia** NVDA /¬†**Expected Move:¬†6.9%**¬†/ Recent moves: -1%, +4%, +5% * **Lucid** LCID /¬†**Expected Move:¬†14.6%**¬†/ Recent moves: -3%, +4%, -7%, +10% * **Etsy** ETSY /¬†**Expected Move:¬†9.6%**¬†/ Recent moves: +14%, +10%, -17%, +16%  **Thursday**  * **Block** SQ /¬†**Expected Move:¬†9.2%**¬†/ Recent moves: +12%, -2%, +1%, +26% * **Alibaba** BABA /¬†**Expected Move:¬†5.7%**¬†/ Recent moves: +8%, +2%, +15%, -1% * **Carvana** CVNA /¬†**Expected Move:¬†23.5%**¬†/ Recent moves: -39%, +40%, -10%, +21% * **Domino‚Äôs Pizza** DPZ /¬†**Expected Move: 6.5%**¬†/ Recent moves: +11%, -1%, -5%, 0% * **Mercado Libre** MELI /¬†**Expected Move: 7.1%**¬†/ Recent moves: +8%, +16%, +2%, +4% * **Moderna** MRNA /¬†**Expected Move: 6.6%**¬†/ Recent moves: -1%, +16%, +6%, +15%,;,; 2023-02-20 18:06:15]

These are inside a TFSA (Canadian Tax Free Saving Account, equivalent of a Roth IRA in the US but better since I can cash out tax free anytime). I would like to sell my shares to diversify a bit (AAPL, MSFT, round up to a 100 shares my AMZN position, a few select US companies and the rest in an S&amp;P500 etf). For this I would like to sell 1-2 weeks CC, maybe $10-20 over the price in the hope they get assigned. I'm aware of the risks of the price starting to go dow in the meantime or skyrocketing again past $410-420. Since I've had Nvidia I went through 3 -50% since the highest peak, so not my first rodeo.

[Is holding onto NVDA long term a bad idea?,;,; Pretty much a complete beginner here, looking to do more with my savings.

I‚Äôm up 18% on nvidia now and I‚Äôm aware there‚Äôll be a drop at some point. I don‚Äôt really want the anxiety of checking stocks all day as I‚Äôm the type of guy who‚Äôll just sit there staring at it go up/down rather than getting on with what I‚Äôm meant to be doing. So, I‚Äôd rather just hold onto it long-term. Typing this out now, I guess no one knows how things will pan out. As I‚Äôm only investing small amounts per month, I‚Äôm not really too fussed about losing it. Guess I‚Äôm just asking if anyone else is holding onto it long term?,;,; 2024-01-26 11:22:16]

[Any single-leg BUYERs out there who don't rely so much on TA/Price Action/Indicators?,;,; Wondering if I'm the minority here. When I talk with various option traders I feel like there are 5 types I've come across:  1. Those who rely on indicators to trade 2. Those who rely on price-action to trade 3. Option sellers 4. Those who employ more advanced option strats (iron condor, etc.) 5. Single-leg BUYERs (who don't rely too much on TA/price-action or indicators but are more based on business hypotheses: e.g."I bet NVIDIA will do well over the next few months because of the recent interest in AI and the need for chips")  \#5 is mainly me. For this style of trading I feel it's important to know your prediction hit rate so that you can make sure you take on option trades that have an appropriate level of risk:reward given your hit-rate.

[Good sources of information more important than understanding technical analysis??,;,; Hello, I have been trading options for years now and I still don‚Äôt know what I am doing. We all agree that trading options is gambling. But also I realized that nowadays I spend more time doing research on Reddit or talking on online groups than doing actual technical analysis.   Most of my trades are %50 based on experience on how I know the stock has performed in the past (just fast glance without drawing lines or anything) and %50 based on what my friends on discord/reddit trade or have read and share. I keep track of all my trades and surprisingly without doing any kind of analysis I am still earning about $1000/month on average. I know it is not much but the simple fact that I am positive just by doing trades talking to people surprises me.  So I wanted to know the opinion of other traders on this. Do you do technical analysis? Which resources do you use to make your trades (which online platforms and groups do you use)?  Also I noticed that most of my groups people always trade the same options (NVIDIA, TESLA, MICRO-STRATEGY, SYP‚Ä¶) Which are the stocks you trade the most?,;,; 2024-02-14 16:50:20]

[What‚Äôs the deal on hedging for day traders?,;,; So I have been trading options for a long time and I have a good system down but I have never hedged my bets I only play around with about 600$ so the losses are not to huge. But since the anticipated earning are coming up I‚Äôm thinking about hedging my bets against Nvidia. I know it‚Äôs probably going to blow up in either direction.

[Covered Call Tax Implications (U.S.),;,; I'm trying to figure out how I need to fix this.  I was the idiot who had covered calls on Nvidia.  I will be assigned with a small profit, so no harm done, or so I thought.  While the stock was shooting up over the summer, my last roll sold for $134,000.  My earlier rolls generated losses of $130,000.  So there would be a gain of $4000, which seems about right.  However, my last roll does not expire until Jan 2024.  So, did I screw myself, as I'll have a $130,000 loss for this tax year, but a $134,000 gain for next year?  When reading about this, the proceeds from a covered call assignment are the strike price + the premium.  That would be $205 \* 600 + $134,000.  When I subtract the basis, it means that I'd have to pay taxes on $129,000 of gains that I used to buy-to-close.  Does this make sense?  And is there a better solution than rolling my Jan calls back into December?  Which seems like my best move.  Good thing I realized this now.  Or am I thinking about this all wrong?,;,; 2023-08-21 00:04:20]

[Do you find hedges effective?,;,; Do you believe in hedging your equity portfolio with options/futures or do you find it to be a drag on performance from a compounded growth perspective?  Example: shareholders of SPY could hedge shares with a put option expiring in 2 years that would cost roughly 8% of your total portfolio but would limit total losses to only 8% over a 2 year period. There's obviously a 4%/year annual drag on returns but do you feel that it is a positive EV hedge over the long term?,;,; 2023-10-25 02:03:02]
[NVDA May 24 earnings strategy,;,; Gaming GPU sales are probably still down, but server/business sales account for 60% of their profit. With the explosion of AI and NVDAs 80% market share for AI processors, they have to potential to beat earnings and shoot even higher. If they miss earning though I think the stock could drop $20-30.   I think the deciding factor is really how much extra revenue they're making from AI hardware. ChatGPT alone runs on 10,000 nvidia processors, each costing more than $10K. Hard to tell really how many AI servers are being constructed.   Last time I asked about earnin predictions here though you guys convinced me to not get AAPL cals because it wouldnt rise high enough, which it did and could have made 300% returns. So I might just do the opposite of the consensus here, but I'm interested to hear anyone's thoughts.   Thank you,;,; 2023-05-18 22:04:48]

[My NVDA Earnings Play: Neutral Stance with a Focus on IV Drop,;,; I'm expecting a strong report from NVDA. Under such circumstances I usually open ratio calls, especially when the stock is at highs, but this time I chose not to take that risk.  Instead, I've opened a relatively neutral position, but with strong negative vega, anticipating a drop in IV post-earnings report:  * Bought 3 Dec15 Puts at $500 * Sold 12 Dec15 Puts at $450 * Bought 6 Nov24 Puts at $465 * Bought 1 Dec15 Call at $540 * Sold 1 Nov24 Call at $560 * Debit: $2567. Collateral: $30000.  After a positive earnings report, I'm expecting a drop below $500 and aim to profit from the Dec15 $500 Puts. Still, just in case, I bought the Dec15 $540 Call as a hedge against a surprisingly strong report. I'll decide what to do with the short $560 call based on market reaction.  As a safety measure, I also bought 6 Nov24 $465 Puts. While I don‚Äôt strongly anticipate an unpleasant surprise, the significant rise in November could still lead to severe disappointments.  https://preview.redd.it/wfu1gm8irq1c1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47f61343dbd042759f522bca4e01a921891bfb1c  UPD1: My expectations for a strong NVIDIA (NVDA) report were mostly met, but I anticipated the market's downturn to happen a bit later. Nevertheless, it's not a big issue. As expected, the implied volatility (IV) in December options plummeted, and my position is holding up well. However, I can't boast about profits yet because the Nov24 puts I had as a hedge against any sudden negative surprises also became worthless.  Just before yesterday's report, I decided to hedge a bit against a minor decline by buying a Dec15 Straddle at $540, selling 2 Dec15 Puts at $460, and 3 Dec15 Calls at $630, costing me an additional $3828.  So, in total, the position's debit stands at $6395.  I'm not a fan of such situations, but I'm banking on the stock correcting itself in the next 2-3 weeks, along with the broader market ‚Äì I'm still holding some¬†SOXS¬†and¬†SQQQ.  https://preview.redd.it/k86v0y6jby1c1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dda234e908c80ee24f954caf7202d7aaa570f65d  UPD2: I've closed my position in NVDA's Dec15 options. Some of the bought puts expired OTM on Nov 24th, but this didn't prevent me from achieving a credit of $8367 upon closing yesterday. In total, that's a profit of $1972 minus a commission of $81.64.  I was asked why I opened such a 'complex' position when my main aim was the IV crush? Wouldn't it have been simpler to sell a strangle? For instance, the same Dec15 Puts 450 and Dec15 Calls 540?  Yes, it would have been simpler. And it might even have been more profitable. However, the profitability is debatable.  I wouldn't have dared to sell that volume of puts without at least partial insurance. And selling naked calls on NVDA before the earnings report, I consider downright reckless.  With my approach I was prepared for any scenario, and I was likely to secure my $1.5-2k profit regardless.  https://preview.redd.it/i9ox84qbnc3c1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c60a2f22f45a7ddf45df56fdc86d82ec7592285b,;,; 2023-11-21 18:10:00]

[Week of 5-22-23 ER Retrospective,;,; For this week I was tracking 30 stocks as they reported earnings this week.

This analysis does NOT track options pricing, which especially as we get to the end of the week can see gamma move option pricing significantly, as we are approaching a 0-DTE scenario (Friday).  Best Performance vs. Implied Move:     |Ticker|Implied Move|Actual Move (Intraday)|Move Multiple of Implied Move| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |ZIM|9.5%|25.9%|2.7| |ANF|15.7|34.8%|2.2| |ADI|4%|14.95%|3.7| |APPS|18%|43.25%|2.4| |NVDA|10.1%|26%|2.6| |DLTR|5.9%|19.2%|3.3| |MRVL|7.6%|44.6%|5.8| |ULTA|6.1%|14.41%|2.4|  &amp;#x200B;  Of the 30 stocks tracked (ZIM, ZM, LOW, DKS, WSM, TOL, PANW, URBN, VFC, INTU, FUTU, ANF, KSS, ADI, XPEV, SPLK, APPS, NVDA, SNOW, BBY, MDT, WB, BURL, DLTR, GPS, ADSK, MRVL, WDAY, ULTA, &amp; PDD, 18 could have been profitable ER trades. That equates to 60%, while 40% were losers, and would have made money shorting ER through something like an Iron Condor, or whichever strategy you prefer.

[Expected moves this week: Bank of America, Goldman, Netflix, Tesla and more.,;,; SPY was higher by 2.5% last week. A much larger move than options were pricing. Vol remains low across the board. To start this week the futures are pulling back a bit and with that, the VIX is starting the week off around 14 (the historical mean is around 19). This is the first full week of earnings season. Tomorrow we get a second round of big bank reports when we hear from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley (Goldman is a day later) as well as a look into online brokerage with Schwab and Interactive Brokers. On Wednesday two of the popular trading names take center stage with both Tesla and Netflix reporting after the close. We also hear from more airlines like United and get an early look at the chip sector with Taiwan Semi on Thursday. And finally a look at consumer credit and spending with American Express on Friday.  A pretty packed Tuesday through Friday so make sure to check the calendar each day. Next week things heat up even more with some mega-cap tech.

[Expected moves today, Powell, SPY, VIX,;,; Futures are lower for a 3rd straight day as the market waits for Fed Chair Powell's testimony in front of Congress. Some of his prepared remarks were released before the bell. The 3 day losing streak hasn't added up to much of a sell-off as of yet. The SPY is lower by about 1.5% since an intra-week high last Thursday. Nor has it affected vol much, the VIX is even lower than it was during that Thursday high in stocks.   As mentioned alot recently, yes vol is low, but the moves in the market are also very muted. The realized vol in SPY over the past month now sits at 12. Options in SPY are about 11 vol for the upcoming few weeks. In other words, IV is currently reflective of how the market is moving. Therefore option buyers are still having to get direction correct and be very nimble, despite how "cheap" vol is. Short-term option trading is basically a battle between implied vol, and realized vol. The mean reversion of IV (buying low IV, selling high IV) typically needs more time to play out. Speaking of that, when vol is this low for this long it's sometimes helpful to begin to look out a few months and see how low IV has been dragged down by what's happening recently. A look at SPY vol out in November and December shows at-the-money vol around 15-16. To put that in perspective, that's both below historical averages for IV, but it's also much lower than the realized vol if SPY over the past year, which is around 20, even with the slow grind of the past few months.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Action:**  * Tesla Inc (TSLA) +0.54% * Marathon Digital Hldgs Inc (MARA) +5.38% * Riot Platforms Inc (RIOT) +3.82% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +0.96% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.66% * Coinbase Global Inc Cl A (COIN) +2.89% * Opendoor Technologies Inc (OPEN) +4.23% * Alibaba Group Holding ADR (BABA) -0.65% * Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) +0.24% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.33% * Carvana Company Cl A (CVNA) +0.55% * Li Auto Inc ADR (LI) +3.14% * C3.Ai Inc Cl A (AI) -0.76%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * KB Home (KBH) Expected Move: 7.97% * Winnebago Industries, Inc.

[Expensive Options Case Study: TSM,;,; TSM seems like a great stock to sell options on. Because implied volatility is so high, we'll make a ton of theta while the stock remains relatively calm.   This simple trade will make around 1% in a month. Here is my research:  ## What is TSMC?  TSMC is a semiconductor manufacturing company with huge companies such as AMD, Apple, NVIDIA, and more as its clients. Here‚Äôs how the stock has been moving recently:  https://preview.redd.it/zwn9unjsxl1b1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a3cf3c28124f0d03727868ec7cc9780a576383c  While the stock made an impressive run at the beginning of the year, it‚Äôs calmed down a bit. The stock has stayed around the $90-ish mark, ranging from roughly $85 to $95.  The implied volatility of TSM has been high for the last several months. The current implied vol is 27.51, but the realized vol is around 25.03.  https://preview.redd.it/e8mt1mftxl1b1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13e66f5e6aa83d54d896d429c7760bf1da112b61  We can see that there‚Äôs been a significant premium, and even though the spread is gradually closing, implied volatility remains above realized volatility. Options sellers are winning here since theta is eating away at too much of the options' value compared to the gamma they have to put up with.   Of course, we're not supposed to directly compare implied volatility (a forward-looking figure) to historical realized volatility. However, we can use historical data to try and forecast future volatility three different ways:  ## Predicting Alpha Volatility Forecast  The Predicting Alpha terminal forecasts volatility using a blend of IVs and RVs. This is a quick and easy way for volatility traders to understand where implied volatility should be trading. For TSM, the PA forecast is¬†**22.69%.**  ## Realized Volatility  Another estimate for future volatility is simply using the 30-day realized volatility. Since volatility tends to cluster, historical volatility tends to be a good estimator of future volatility. The 30-day window ensures we have enough data without using old, irrelevant data. For TSM, the 30D realized volatility is¬†**25.03%.**  ## Implied Volatility  Since implied volatility is the market‚Äôs expectation of future volatility, implied volatility can be a good predictor of future volatility. Implied volatility tends to be just a tad higher than realized, though, because of the variance risk premium. This is the case with TSM; on average, IV is about 1.06x RV:  https://preview.redd.it/ve6937kuxl1b1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=711b19614d3dbbfa5de1904d11b5b65ff65ae7e1     By removing the variance risk premium from implied volatility, we can find our third forecast of volatility:¬†**25.9%.**  ## Forecast of Volatility  By taking an average of our three estimates, we have an average of 24.54%. Compared to our current 27.51 vol, that‚Äôs a 3-point difference!  The market price of the $92 June monthly straddle is around 5.28, but at a 24.54 vol, the straddle should be only worth 4.71. By selling the straddle, we make about $57 monthly on less than $5000 in margin.  ## Position Sizing and Management.  As for position management, I would continue to hold this trade if TSM happens to be less volatile than implied. If we start to see multiple days in a row of outsized moves, I will cut the position early, even at a loss. Of course, if implied volatility drops, we can get out once the edge is gone.  ## Conclusion  This is just one of many trades that should be a part of a short-vol book. The research is solid, but the edge isn‚Äôt enough to YOLO our life savings.  Trade it small; find many similar trades to spread your risk!  Good luck, and happy trading.,;,; 2023-05-23 16:29:10]
[Expected Moves this week, SPY, VIX, QQQ, MU and more.,;,; SPY was lower last week by about 0.6%, again, inside what options were pricing. Implied vol closed extremely low into the weekend, with SPY some at-the-money SPY weekly options sporting single-digit handles. That IV should reset a bit higher out of the weekend but overall vol remains historically below average and at multi-year lows. The VIX closed last week below 13.50. Of course, vol could always go lower, but it's getting to the point where those lower moves would be quite small. In general the 12-13 range in the VIX floor over the past 5 years and only on rare occasions over longer time horizons do you see it closer to 10. That's not to say it can't remain this low for a long time, but it can't get much lower. One thing to note from the past 2 weeks, the daily realized moves of the market versus what 0DTE options had been pricing has started to tip a bit in the favor of the market moves over the expected moves, particularly in the QQQ. That kind of action tends to put a floor on IV as well as option trading in same-day expiry is heavy volume and being more or less re-priced each day based on the prior day's result. Futures are flat to lower to start off the week.  This past weekend included some political chaos in Russia but markets this week will most likely concentrate on a combo of economic data like GDP &amp; Durable Goods and speeches by Lagarde (tues) and Powell (wed, thurs). SPY options are pricing about a 1.1% move for the week at 10 vol (at the money) although that could get a lift on the open.

[Expected moves: Pepsi, Delta, JP Morgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, Amazon and more.,;,; Futures are once again bid higher. Stocks were green pre-market even before the PPI release which followed up well to yesterday's CPI, and was also cooler than expected. Both are encouraging signs about inflation. Earnings season started this morning for all intents and purposes with Pepsi and Delta Airlines being the most interesting names reporting so far. Both stocks are higher, and both have beaten their expected move slightly (so far). This is something to keep an eye on as earnings season kicks off. As mentioned yesterday, IV and expected moves in individual stocks are the lowest they've been in years. That does not mean options are completely wrong per se, vol is low for a reason across the market... But what it does mean is that individual stocks are more likely to move beyond their expected move on earnings than on average. Simply because the moves are that much smaller than typical. It also means the vol crushes after earnings are less, which may be helpful in deciding whether or not to hold positions through the event.   It's also entirely possible that any outsized moves happen more often in one direction than the other, which has more to do with the overall trend in the market. right now that trend is higher as we enter earnings so keep an eye on whether stocks beat expected moves to the upside more than the downside, or vice versa.

It's been a positive week for SPY, up about 1.1% coming into this morning (not counting the futures being higher). That's about in line with the move options were pricing for the week, so a positive day today would take stocks beyond what options had priced. That slow grind in a low-vol environment can be frustrating for option sellers as upside calls are really cheap and really close to the money when a trade is entered... so trade management on a slow creep higher is important. Option vol remains low and may get lower into the close preceding what is a quasi 3-and-a-half day weekend that market makers will not want to be owning a ton of premium into.  **Today's (0DTE) expected moves:**  * SPY: 0.5% * QQQ: 0.7%  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market:**  * Renalytix Ai Plc ADR (RNLX) +41.06% * Genfit S.A.

[Expected moves: VIX pickup, SPY, QQQ Grind lower. Rare Friday Earns from Palo Alto,;,; Stocks are lower again to start Friday. It's been a rough week overall, with the SPY down about 2.5% or so. That's more than double the move options were pricing, and the moves have been a bit more than 0DTE options have been pricing each day. Near-term options are waking up a bit, with 0DTE pricing in expected moves for SPY now out at about 0.7% or so each day, that's up from just 0.4% a few weeks ago. The VIX is now near 19 meaning 30-day vol is back to about its historical average. One interesting data point to add to this is that the SPY itself has not been THAT volatile. It's off a bit more than 5% from its highs, and the recent selling has been a grind lower, not much panic selling. That's not just a *vibe*, the realized vol in SPY for the past 30 days is still just 10. That will likely begin to increase a bit with the past week seeing moves in excess of what options were pricing, but again, the selling has been orderly in the major indices thus far.  Nothing on the economic data front today but next week is the Jackson Hole Conference which takes on some additional significance after this week's more hawkish than expected FOMC minutes as well as what's going on in China's markets.  A rare after-hours on Friday earnings report today from Palo Alto Networks. That may have some traders spooked a bit as it does feel like a Friday news dump (where you'd try to bury bad news when everyone is already away from their desks). However, the last SP 500 company to do the same was Nike in 2020 and that report was good. So who knows. Here's how options are trying to price the event, an odd one as you have to go out to next Friday's options, not today's, to trade options that capture the event:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/54a32hdvevib1.png?width=823&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5971ace74cf257bca6c1e2c9d0c4d9f6196a213  The 8% move matches that prior reports actual move of +8%.

[Expected moves: Netflix, Tesla and more.,;,; The second round of big bank earnings are out with Bank of America, PNC and Morgan Stanley reporting this morning. The results have not been market-moving as of yet. MS is unched as of now, with BAC down slightly, both with moves less than options were pricing. PNC is down about 3% vs a 3.5% expected move. So the reactions are pretty muted all things considered. The broader market thinks the same, with futures all red but very slightly. Most of the bank stocks were lower over the past 3 months with the exception of JPM. JPM has also performed the best from the bank stocks that reported last week, initially giving up its earnings move gains but recovering much of them with a strong up day yesterday. Goldman reports tomorrow and then the focus shifts quickly to mega-cap tech after the bell tomorrow with Netflix and Tesla kicking things off.

[Expected moves: A little life in market vol, SPY QQQ VIX Netflix and more,;,; Stock futures are lower for the second straight day. It's a big two days for economic data, following yesterday's Fed minutes. This morning, ADP reported \~500k private sector jobs added, doubling expectations. That sent futures lower as it's yet another sign the FOMC is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer and potentially be more aggressive with raises. The US 2-year treasury yield is above 5% near this year's high, but more importantly, nearing levels it hasn't seen since 2006. Stocks have absorbed higher interest rate assumptions over the past 2 months quite well, rising with the rising yields. That played out mainly due to lessening fears of a recession (and the AI hype driving tech stocks higher). If the jobs number comes in hot tomorrow it will be just the latest data point pointing to a persistently strong economy, driving yields higher, and assumptions of a more hawkish Fed for the balance of 2023. There are signs elsewhere in the economic data of an economy that's cooling off in certain sectors, but jobs and hiring has remained strong, and we'll find out more on the front tomorrow. This 2-day pullback in stocks is breathing a little life into option vol. The VIX is now \~15.30, up from 13 just a few trading days ago.   As was mentioned in this space, vol got about as low as you'd ever see over the past two weeks. That didn't mean it would immediately go higher, but it was unlikely to go much lower. A 15.30 VIX is still historically low but it does show a little appetite for traders to buy options. Something we haven't seen much of over the past several weeks. Skew is near the highest levels of the past few years, meaning downside put strikes were already more expensive than upside call strikes. That is largely reflective of a low IV environment where the percentage differences get magnified, but keep an eye on that skew number as the VIX rises, if it remains high, it would be showing continued demand for puts even at higher vol, and therefore be a good indication of any fear in the market.   With earnings season approaching, it's also interesting to look at how low individual stock IV got and how it's pricing upcoming earnings. Netflix, which reports on the 19th, has 55 IV at the moment for the event, pricing in about an 8% move (that includes all the time leading up to the event as well.) For perspective, in Netflix's last 6 earnings, the stock has moved less than 8% just twice and has had +/-7% moves 5 out of 6 times. In other words, vol is low in most individual stocks as compared o the past 2 years, and with earnings right around the corner, you'll see much smaller expected moves on average (as of now).  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Movers:**     * Tesla Inc (TSLA) -0.44% * Allarity Therapeutics Inc (ALLR) -51.57% * Bioxcel Therapeutics Inc (BTAI) +23.73% * Genius Sports Ltd (GENI) +9.12% * Meta Platforms Inc (META) +1.70% * Lucid Group Inc (LCID) -1.48% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +0.29% * Riot Platforms Inc (RIOT) +3.24% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.16% * Affirm Holdings Inc Cl A (AFRM) -5.06% * Perion Network Ltd (PERI) +7.22%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**     * Levi Strauss &amp; Co.

[Nancy Pelosi and NVDA Calls at $120 Strike,;,; (This is not a political post. Please leave out your views of Pelosi).  The financial news widely reported that in November, Nancy Pelosi bought 50 Call options on NVDA Dec 20 2024. The strike is $120.   As a relative newbie at options, I don't get what the play is here? Nvidia shares are currently around $488 and a December 2024 ATM call is around $95. A $120 strike call is $373. This is so deep in the money that it's half way to China.   Her husband is a high level finance guy. Clearly not a dummy. Why would one buy calls this deep ITM?  Please, speak as you might to a young child, or a golden retriever. ,;,; 2023-12-24 18:55:17]
[NVDA options,;,; Just simply venting. My portfolio is doing fine and I‚Äôm sticking to rules.   Saw NVDA today and thought let me ‚Äúgamble‚Äù and break my rules.

So much hopium in this position with retailer traders it seems like they will buy at any level.,;,; 2024-02-10 00:36:41]
[NVDA Strategy,;,; I am bearish on NVDA within a 1-2 year horizon. I think the current valuation of NVDA is too high, and will retrace within the next 1-2 years. I know the market can stay irrational longer than I can stay solvent, so what is the best play in trying to capitalise on my thesis?  Are far dated NVDA puts a valid strategy, if so at what strike and expiry is most effective given this scenario?  Interested to hear others thoughts on strategies involving NVDA.

[Straddle on NVDA on Earnings,;,; Thinking about selling a straddle just before earnings with the expectation that the market reaction to earnings will be more mild than expected. Seems like the consensus is expecting the stock to pull back or rip up more. NVDA has great margins and produces strong cashflows, but could it be that they will merely meet expectations? Am I am idiot for thinking the implied move will be smaller than expected? I would love to sell that implied volatility and collect that premium. What am I missing? Why am I wrong? Thanks,;,; 2024-02-17 13:46:03]
[NVDA Covered call out of hands,;,; I sold a covered call against NVDA back in Feb 2023 with initial expiration for April 2023 and strike price at 210 with cost basis of 160. During March 2023 NVDA crossed 230 and to avoid assignment I rolled it to 240 with expiration in 2025. It was a dumb move from my side. Now the call value is 510$. I can‚Äôt close it as i need 51000$ nor it is called away as the expiration is in 2025. What to do here. I feel anxious daily seeing at the call value increasing exponentially while my upside is limited to just 8000$ at any time. Can i do something to increase the upside or is there any way i can close the call with minimum capital?,;,; 2024-02-16 08:13:53]
[NVDA iron condor,;,; So like the rest of retail, I think nvda is likely overvalued in the long term but still has short term hype upside.   Going into earnings the implied move looks to be around $20 (7%) so I‚Äôm thinking about opening an imbalanced iron condor where I have downside protection that covers the whole position on a miss but still has around 60-90% upside potential on an earnings or expectations beat. Would love a tear down.  Specifically looking at 312.5/297.5p and 312.5/340c,;,; 2023-05-23 13:03:48]
[NVDA $415 call June 16,;,; this stock just tore through yesterday and blew past my strike price today. Guessing I overplayed my hand . Has NVDA done this to anybody else?  Trying to learn from this experience. I understand its a volatile stock but I couldn't understand how to price these events or scenarios in while picking a strike price. At the time of selling, the prob of ITM was 18% and today its 50%. granted its only an indicator and not surity, but can you provide any ideas about what other metrics to look at while picking a strike price.  I own the stock but didn't want it called away if it comes to that. Lesson learnt. I will make a profit if its assigned so profit is not the worry.  what should the strategy be with volatile stocks? Do we always close our position before expiration? Trying to learn the mechanics here  Any input is appreciated.,;,; 2023-06-14 14:22:12]
[NVDA call mooned minutes after I sold. Need advice,;,; Sold NVDA call 2 minutes before it skyrocketed. What could I have done better?  https://i.imgur.com/0MluCDh.png  This morning I had a NVDA $740 call expiring 16/2. Paid 11.05usd for it. On market open it was instantly down to $3. I quickly accepted I would probably make a loss on it, but patiently waited for a moment where I could hopefully sell for a loss that wasn‚Äôt too bad.   After about an hour and a half of slow increase with the RSI being well below 30, the stock price started climbing. After a pretty big climb ($16 ish) I was ready to sell at $8-9. I just didn‚Äôt think it could keep going. I was also expecting today to be a profit taking day. I sold at $8.20. The option price then dipped, and I was happy that I sold at a decent time.   Then less than 2 minutes later the stock price just skyrocketed. I would have even made profit if I held for about 5 mins longer.   Obviously it‚Äôs all a gamble. But did this come down to analysis skills?,;,; 2024-02-13 23:02:01]
[NVDA options suggestions,;,; I am curious to know more about pursuing to buy a call option soon, with a strike amount of about 200-300. Any suggestions on what to understand or when to sell the stock after it hits or goes above the market value that I bought the option at the time? Very very new to this.,;,; 2024-01-25 12:52:00]
[Playing on NVDA earnings,;,; Wanting to buy some some calls and puts approx. 5%, 10%, and 12% otm before earnings release. My understanding is the stock must move more than the implied direction in order to become profitable.   Does anyone know how to calculate what that will be by feb 23? Guess I‚Äôm a bit confused because I watched the META options today and all of the strikes from ITM to OTM looked profitable yet I always hear how IV crush kills most premiums.,;,; 2024-02-03 00:29:40]

[NVDA Long Puts $100P@Jan2025: Buy now or wait?,;,; NVDA seems way overvalued with the recent AI hype, pricing a P/S of ~25 and P/E of ~150. This is absolutely madness and the upcoming recession riding on the back of inflation fears has made it difficult to justify this price. Hence, I'm thinking of buying Puts on NVDA but with longer dated expiration.  However, I think NVDA will cross $300 in this month, fueled by a rally as CPI headline comes cooler on the 12th April. Which should lower the Puts premium. What do you think? Please scrutinize this trade plan below.  Option: NVDA $100P@Jan2025  Current Premium: $5  Expected buying premium: $3.5  Expected profit: 4x to 5x,;,; 2023-04-08 02:14:37]
[Is there potential to short NVDA?,;,; I was taking a look at the general semiconductor industry and was surprised by the metrics of NVDA. The company is valued at 780 Billion when only posting 3 billion dollars in cash flow. Furthermore, NVDA is priced to trade 51 times forwards earnings next year. The forward FCF measure will likely be greater than 51 times as NVDA also has capex costs of around 1 billion in recent years.   I also do understand the semiconductor industry is extremely cyclical (especially for GPU producers). This can lead to these metrics becoming misleading in some scenarios but in this case they are still concerning. At this valuation even if NVDA 5x FCF they would trade at 52 times FCF. This is extremely concerning.  I do understand NVDA is a high growth company as the general GPU and semiconductor market grows. However this valuation seems obscene and reminds me a lot of NVDA before the big sell of from its former valuation at similar levels.  Seems that going short through ITM or ATM long dated puts seems legitimate. What do you guys think?,;,; 2023-05-19 04:10:36]
[NVDA Earnings Play Seems Needlessly Risky &amp; Not Enough Profit,;,; I admit I am pretty new to the world of options, but I dont understand how participating in NVDA earnings is a wise choice.  The eye-boggling share price and implied volatility/ridiculously expensive premiums means that - even for an option play - people require a sh\*t ton of capital AND have a fairly bold call/put strike price in order to make profit above 10k. And lets be honest is anyone playing NVDA ER for only a small profit in mind?  Isn't the wisest move to do ER options trades for companies with much much lower share prices and a lot less implied volatility?  I get that NVDA's ER is going to be "the Super Bowl of options", and that generates a ton of interest and participation, but from a pure risk/reward perspective, NVDA earnings release seems like an event that should be avoided.  Thoughts?,;,; 2024-02-19 02:04:35]
[Exit on an NVDA iron condor.,;,; Yes, fairly new to options.   Yes, it‚Äôs a very risky and poorly considered position. It‚Äôs a lotto ticket.   I‚Äôve been on a good run the last few weeks wanted some lotto tickets for the weekend to buy with some profits. I sold an iron condor on NVDA. 5x 1/26 595/600c 600/605p. Entry was $26 per, so I‚Äôm not sweating it too bad but I‚Äôm trying to maximize my education for the tuition.   My thesis was simple: when I entered the position on Friday, NVDA was at 580 and, to my eye, was losing steam and would probably close out the day around there. Next week, it would  probably go up more because momentum and memes, but not like this week, so 20 looks about right.   Then NVDA does what NVDA does and I got schooled. It went up another 15 bucks and I‚Äôm now very close to ITM but very early and NVDA seems likely to continue going up, delta beating theta and leaving me in the wake.   My exit strategy is simple: get the fuck out of the position on Monday unless the open is something in the 570‚Äôs.   Is there a better exit idea? Close the call spread and ride the put? Roll the whole thing upwards? Roll just the put spread up because the call spread is already about as worthless as it‚Äôs going to be?,;,; 2024-01-21 04:57:32]
[NVDA put back ratio,;,; My trading style dictates that I‚Äôm always long volatility and the best way to do this I‚Äôve found is with back ratio spreads on volatile stocks.   I opened a this back ratio onNVDA immediately after the large move up fully expecting it to keep going up but wanted downside exposure nonetheless so I opened this position 2 SEP 335 P and then -1 SEP 385 P for a small credit.  Since then NVDA has gone up and the long puts are down 57% but those losses have almost entirely been offset by the short leg. Now that NVDA is nearing some resistance I will take profits on the short leg and effectively double my exposure to the downside with a much better risk/reward now that the long put net liq has shrunk so dramatically.  I find this to be an excellent strategy to catch knives while very effectively managing risk.   Would love to get feedback on the strategy thanks,;,; 2023-06-15 07:30:46]
[Protecting nvda profits from earnings gapdown,;,; Hi I have about 80 something nvda stocks purchased.

[Is holding onto NVDA long term a bad idea?,;,; Pretty much a complete beginner here, looking to do more with my savings.

I‚Äôm up 18% on nvidia now and I‚Äôm aware there‚Äôll be a drop at some point. I don‚Äôt really want the anxiety of checking stocks all day as I‚Äôm the type of guy who‚Äôll just sit there staring at it go up/down rather than getting on with what I‚Äôm meant to be doing. So, I‚Äôd rather just hold onto it long-term. Typing this out now, I guess no one knows how things will pan out. As I‚Äôm only investing small amounts per month, I‚Äôm not really too fussed about losing it. Guess I‚Äôm just asking if anyone else is holding onto it long term?,;,; 2024-01-26 11:22:16]

[Rolling NVDA covered calls‚Ä¶into earnings,;,; Just curious, does it make sense to roll NVDA short calls going into next week‚Äôs earnings?  I‚Äôve got a covered call consisting of: - 2025 expiry call option with strike of 500 - short call of 785 expiring today  With premiums looking good I‚Äôm thinking of rolling the short call by 1 week to next fri. Instead of rolling it to a 785 strike, I‚Äôm thinking of selling call in the 950-1050 range.  I‚Äôve got 3 scenarios in my head after earnings are out: 1. Earnings crushes estimates but price doesn‚Äôt move much, I collect my premiums (and wished I‚Äôd sold calls at 850 range) 2. Earnings crushes and price flies beyond 1100 (and I wished I‚Äôd sold calls at the 1300 range) 3. Earnings flops, price flops.   Without a doubt, my main concern is option 3 since I‚Äôm quite ITM. Is it a good idea to avoid selling calls going into earnings altogether and let the chips fall where they may? Or sell call and and be satisfied with the premiums?

[Selling deep ITM covered calls on TSLA/NVDA for 4% monthly returns?,;,; YouTube recommended this guy to me who says he makes 4% every month selling deep ITM covered calls on NVDA and TSLA. He is selling somewhere around the .80 delta calls to extract the extrinsic value from the options and planning to take assignment. He says he makes around 48%+ annualized returns doing this (4% per month \* 12 months), which I'm highly skeptical about. Here is the [NVDA video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDM6Be0KeA) and the [TSLA video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2RuTls6AQA) I'm referring to.  Here's a current example I came up with for TSLA using this method ([view on OptionsProfitCalculator here](http://opcalc.com/QIa)):  * Buy 100 shares of TSLA at $196.48. * Sell the 3/31 170C for $33.25 (\~32 DTE). * Total cost = $19,648 - $3,325 = $16,323 (breakeven at $163.23). * Your shares get called away at $170 each, for a gain of $677 (4.15% return on the $16,323 of capital). * Rinse and repeat monthly.  I know there's no such thing as a free lunch, so I'm trying to figure out what the trade-offs are.  Here are the downsides I can think of:  * The stock could drop below your breakeven causing you to take an unrealized loss. * Wash sale rule could cause tax implications if you rebuy shares that are called away without waiting 31 days (i.e. must pay taxes on the full premium received, but can't write off the "loss" of the shares). * There is no upside potential if the stock moves higher.  And the upsides:  * Lower risk to the downside on the trade (compared to selling OTM covered calls). * If the stock does drop significantly, your cost-basis/breakeven has been lowered considerably (down to $163.23 from $196.48).  It seems like this is effectively the same as selling a cash-secured put (e.g. selling the 3/31 170P for $5.60), except this strategy returns about 20% more premium.  This is only possible due to the high volatility of these two stocks, right? A few other tickers I've checked don't return anywhere near 4% premium monthly using this strategy.  What do you guys think about this? Is there anything else I'm missing here?,;,; 2023-02-27 07:02:42]

[Seeking Advice on NVDA May ‚Äô24 530 Call Option - Hold, Sell, or Exercise?,;,; Hello everyone,  I‚Äôm currently holding an NVDA call option with a strike price of $530, expiring in May 2024. As of the last check, the stock is trading at $178.10, with the option showing a significant increase in value. The bid price stands at $185.10 and the ask at $189.65.  Given the current market conditions and the significant time until expiration, I‚Äôm considering my next steps. Should I:  	1.	Sell the option now to realize profits given the current premium? 	2.	Continue holding the option in anticipation of further stock price increases? 	3.	Exercise the option early and acquire the underlying shares?  I understand that the decision is complex and depends on various factors, including market expectations, the time value of money, and personal investment strategies. I‚Äôd appreciate any insights or experiences you could share, especially regarding the optimal timing for such decisions.  Thank you for your guidance!,;,; 2024-02-07 22:55:01]
[My NVDA Earnings Play: Neutral Stance with a Focus on IV Drop,;,; I'm expecting a strong report from NVDA. Under such circumstances I usually open ratio calls, especially when the stock is at highs, but this time I chose not to take that risk.  Instead, I've opened a relatively neutral position, but with strong negative vega, anticipating a drop in IV post-earnings report:  * Bought 3 Dec15 Puts at $500 * Sold 12 Dec15 Puts at $450 * Bought 6 Nov24 Puts at $465 * Bought 1 Dec15 Call at $540 * Sold 1 Nov24 Call at $560 * Debit: $2567. Collateral: $30000.  After a positive earnings report, I'm expecting a drop below $500 and aim to profit from the Dec15 $500 Puts. Still, just in case, I bought the Dec15 $540 Call as a hedge against a surprisingly strong report. I'll decide what to do with the short $560 call based on market reaction.  As a safety measure, I also bought 6 Nov24 $465 Puts. While I don‚Äôt strongly anticipate an unpleasant surprise, the significant rise in November could still lead to severe disappointments.  https://preview.redd.it/wfu1gm8irq1c1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47f61343dbd042759f522bca4e01a921891bfb1c  UPD1: My expectations for a strong NVIDIA (NVDA) report were mostly met, but I anticipated the market's downturn to happen a bit later. Nevertheless, it's not a big issue. As expected, the implied volatility (IV) in December options plummeted, and my position is holding up well. However, I can't boast about profits yet because the Nov24 puts I had as a hedge against any sudden negative surprises also became worthless.  Just before yesterday's report, I decided to hedge a bit against a minor decline by buying a Dec15 Straddle at $540, selling 2 Dec15 Puts at $460, and 3 Dec15 Calls at $630, costing me an additional $3828.  So, in total, the position's debit stands at $6395.  I'm not a fan of such situations, but I'm banking on the stock correcting itself in the next 2-3 weeks, along with the broader market ‚Äì I'm still holding some¬†SOXS¬†and¬†SQQQ.  https://preview.redd.it/k86v0y6jby1c1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dda234e908c80ee24f954caf7202d7aaa570f65d  UPD2: I've closed my position in NVDA's Dec15 options. Some of the bought puts expired OTM on Nov 24th, but this didn't prevent me from achieving a credit of $8367 upon closing yesterday. In total, that's a profit of $1972 minus a commission of $81.64.  I was asked why I opened such a 'complex' position when my main aim was the IV crush? Wouldn't it have been simpler to sell a strangle? For instance, the same Dec15 Puts 450 and Dec15 Calls 540?  Yes, it would have been simpler. And it might even have been more profitable. However, the profitability is debatable.  I wouldn't have dared to sell that volume of puts without at least partial insurance. And selling naked calls on NVDA before the earnings report, I consider downright reckless.  With my approach I was prepared for any scenario, and I was likely to secure my $1.5-2k profit regardless.  https://preview.redd.it/i9ox84qbnc3c1.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c60a2f22f45a7ddf45df56fdc86d82ec7592285b,;,; 2023-11-21 18:10:00]

[Hodling Nvda since it was $7,50 : selling CC to get eventually assigned strategy so I can diversify?,;,; Hi everyone, I've had Nvidia (108 shares) since January 4th 2016 for a cost basis of about $7,50/share (bought AMZN at the same time too, these were the first stocks I ever bought). These are inside a TFSA (Canadian Tax Free Saving Account, equivalent of a Roth IRA in the US but better since I can cash out tax free anytime). I would like to sell my shares to diversify a bit (AAPL, MSFT, round up to a 100 shares my AMZN position, a few select US companies and the rest in an S&amp;P500 etf). For this I would like to sell 1-2 weeks CC, maybe $10-20 over the price in the hope they get assigned. I'm aware of the risks of the price starting to go dow in the meantime or skyrocketing again past $410-420. Since I've had Nvidia I went through 3 -50% since the highest peak, so not my first rodeo.

[NVDA May 24 earnings strategy,;,; Gaming GPU sales are probably still down, but server/business sales account for 60% of their profit. With the explosion of AI and NVDAs 80% market share for AI processors, they have to potential to beat earnings and shoot even higher. If they miss earning though I think the stock could drop $20-30.   I think the deciding factor is really how much extra revenue they're making from AI hardware. ChatGPT alone runs on 10,000 nvidia processors, each costing more than $10K. Hard to tell really how many AI servers are being constructed.   Last time I asked about earnin predictions here though you guys convinced me to not get AAPL cals because it wouldnt rise high enough, which it did and could have made 300% returns. So I might just do the opposite of the consensus here, but I'm interested to hear anyone's thoughts.   Thank you,;,; 2023-05-18 22:04:48]

[Best single day,;,; So, I started looking into investing heavily back in December. I've had some wins, and some losses, but today was my best single day ever. I had purchased 5 calls on AMD ($3.85) and NVDA ($5.85) on Friday 1/26 DTE - single biggest one day buy.   Monday and Tuesday really kicked me in the nuts, both stocks dropped hard at open and at one point on Tuesday I was down like 2.2k. I told myself they can't keep dipping like this and will bounce.  This morning, boy did they bounce! I sold all AMD contract at ($5.85) and all NVDA at ($9.75). Both climbed higher after my sell. AMD sold because I was didn't see it climbing more and didn't want to lose what I had earned. NVDA sold later when I had a stop limit placed and I was fixing my kids lunch. It did not sell at the stop price, I just didnt set the limit price high enough.   It was a 3k day for me. This was very inspiring for me.

[Most leveraged option trading strategy for a strategy,;,; Hi folks,  I have developed a long strategy with 70% win rate. The strategy is aimed for being a profit/loss in 3 weeks.The price traget is like 10 usd above from current price.  Ex.If spot price of NVDA is 450USD my strategy predicts with 70% accuracy if price of NVDA will reach 460 USD over the next 3 weeks timeframe.  The challenge with this strategy is that we dont know when NVDA  would reach that price target in the 3 week timeframe i.e NVDA could reach PT hypothetically tomorrow or may be at the end of second week.I havent found a single strategy that could cover both these scenarios Ex. Short dated options provide maximum leverage if say NVDA reached the price traget in 1-2 day  but a calendar spread (3/4 weeks) could give good return if say the price reached the target in 3 weeks.I am not considering butterfly as it only gains value around option expiry and around the short strike levels.  My question is , could there be any strategy that could give like 100+% return for price target  being reached in a short time frame or price target being reached in a little longer time ex.2 weeks  NB.I have already played around with optionstrat and still could not find anything solid  Edit1.I may not have been clear when I say return I mean 100%return on risk.This is different from return on my opening cost  Edit2.The reason for 100% return is to have a positive expectancy for the strategy.Tjeoretivally even a 60% return would give me 12% return on average.However I need to aim higher to account for  market turmoils that could break all strategies  Thanks in Advance,;,; 2023-09-15 11:22:31]

[Covered call case (help me understand this!!!),;,; Hey all! A new options trader here for a quick question on a covered call case.  Using the below image as an example, it seems that the differences between Breakeven points of these NVDA contracts are less than a dollar apart, yet the premium spread is nearly $25 ($185.05 on the 535c and the $209 on the 510c) which is nearly a $2500 difference.  https://preview.redd.it/lbn3h1y07lhc1.png?width=1284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9fec170a898aaf10485fec9f86a3ec08a62e5a2c  So my question is,  * How does the Breakeven point come into play on this? If I think that NVDA is going to be under $720.95 before March 15, wouldn't it make more sense for me to sell the 510c with $209 premium since the Breakeven &amp; Chance of Profit spread between these contracts is so slim? Is having a spread of less than a dollar on a Breakeven point (e.g $720.95 and $720.13) worth $2500? What am I missing here? Or is it because of the strike price in case NVDA stays above $720.95 and gets called away? * If I don't mind getting my NVDA shares being called away but thinks that NVDA would stay below $721 which would make the contract worthless, it would make more sense for me to sell the 510c with $209 premium rather than the 535c with $185.05, correct? It seems like I am only making less than a dollar risk on the Breakeven point to receive nearly $2500 premium in return. Even if it gets called away, that $2500 premium difference will pretty much make up for the $25 difference in strike price (510c &amp; 535c) wouldn't it?  I may have worded it a bit complicated but to make it sound more simple, I just want to know the difference or the benefit of selling a 535 covered call vs. 510 covered call with $2500 differences in premium with such a slim spread in Breakeven and Chance of profit.  I apologize in advance if I sound too newb but I just couldn't wrap my head around this by myself :(  Thank you everyone in advance!,;,; 2024-02-09 17:16:06]

[tastytrade not letting me close OTM options that are profitable?,;,; There is this weird "bug" which has been happening to me very recently. I'm rarely profitable and I often "blow up" my account which causes me just to deposit more money.  Yesterday I bought 440 NVDA weekly calls when market opened for like $3. NVDA then proceeded to spike up to 419, I decided I wanted to sell them, at the bid price. I waited awhile, NVDA was collapsing, and then the bid price was no longer my sell price, so I decided to just set a sell limit lower than current bid price. It still wouldn't go through. NVDA 440 call options spiked up all the way to $6 yesterday, then proceeded to collapse.  Untill it collapsed lower than my purchase price and I ended up selling for a loss. With my order going through right away.   This morning the same exact thing happened with spy puts, it refused to fill my order until I posted a sell order for a small loss.  The only time I've had a similar experience is when there was no liquidity. But here these 2 stocks are very liquid, and I was posting my sell price below bid price.  Feels like they aren't accepting my option orders purposely until it's lower than my purchase price. Like they see me as a longtime easy mark where I keep depositing money and blowing up my account. So they decide to just make it easier for me to blow up my account.  another thing I noticed recently is there was a low liquid option I tried to buy, if I put in a bid/sell order that wasn't every 5 cents, such as a bid order of 7 cents. The level 2 on thinkorswim shows my bid order is 10 cents. If I put in a sell order of 12 cents. It shows my sell order is 15 cents.   As for why I'm accepting selling for a loss, is I wanted to just get out of the trades asap, when my plans don't go right, I probably panic sold just so they'll accept my sell orders. Which only happens if I post them below my purchase price.,;,; 2023-05-31 13:58:13]

[Nvidia Expected Move / Earnings Preview,;,; Stocks begin the day slightly in the green but there are some wild swings in companies that just reported. With PTON down 30%, Foot Locker down 30%, and Abercrombie up 15%. Those were all significantly larger moves than options were pricing.  Of course, the big event of the day is Nvidia NVDA earnings after the close. At the moment, options are pricing about a 9.5% move. Recent earnings have seen actual moves of +25%, +14%, -1%, and +4%. In other words, options are pricing a smaller move than the past two events, which have both seen significantly larger moves. Options expiring Friday have implied vol of about 134, while 30-day IV is around 66.  Since that +25% earnings move in May the stock has remained volatile, but with a 16-17% range since early June. The stock is just shy of its all-time high, with the upper expected move around the big round number of $500, while the lower expected move sits at levels where the stock has bounced twice this summer:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/97hfkzpy4vjb1.png?width=813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ead1c5ab30f70c6dff2decb0653b065f7819c3a6  In other words, options sellers would be hoping the stock held that support if the company disappoints, and found sellers at a big fat number of $500, which would be a new all-time high. One thing to look for in situations like that is if there's open the interest around a round number like $500. And in this case, there is, with the 500 line having significantly more open interest than anything around it, with similar open interest as the near-the-money 450 strike:  https://preview.redd.it/tu1g15xd6vjb1.png?width=750&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daf65faf582d3d0429219727507cdb0f1db4feee  That's not a ton to rest your hat on as resistance, but it's something, potential gamma. Therefore, the expected move levels have some reasoning behind them at the moment and may help explain why the expected move is so much less than the past two events. Option buyers of course should be aware of those levels and perhaps look to debit spread to those levels.  As far as how the stock has been moving recently, it's been volatile, but the 30 day actual vol of 49 is in line with how the stock has moved the past year.

[Does this profit taking strategy make sense?,;,; Newbie question here.  I‚Äôm currently holding deep ITM NVDA calls.

[Very long dated deep OTM CCs,;,; Mostly buy &amp; hold investor here but i have been playing around with options (mostly covered calls) in recent months with some success to supercharge my returns and goal being to outperform buy and hold as well as reduce my volatility in the scenario of a market crash. I‚Äôve read so many interesting insights on this channel from very seasoned option traders and am surprised everyone seems to focus so much on 30-60 DTE.  If we take NVDA at $470 today and assume i have 100 shares. Suppose i am happy with a 40% return per year, i can sell a Call $850 Jan 2026 for a premium of $43 and cash in on an additional 10% already today! Seems this is superior to playing with weekly or monthly calls since you have way less margin buffer from spot and may get routinely hit. Also if suddenly there is a huge crash, i will make a lot more money having a ‚Äúbig contract‚Äù outstanding than a weekly call contract.

[Has anyone here EVER had their short call assigned a week early?,;,; I‚Äôm holding four short COVERED calls and all are $80-$100 deep ITM (it‚Äôs NVDA).  I‚Äôm trying to reconcile myself to rolling monthly for the next two years, but having a ton of anxiety about early assignment.  I have already rolled twice, so it will be at least a couple of weeks before I can bump up $10 for a credit.  I‚Äôm seriously sweating bc even though I‚Äôm not really facing any true loss, it will FEEL like it if I sell so cheap (and I couldn‚Äôt afford to buy back in at these prices).  Just looking for reassurance about holding till 10 dte or closer before rolling. UPDATE:  I appreciate all the feedback.  I will be rolling all of them at 21 days to expiration, going out 4-5 weeks and up $10 each time.  This week it has gotten me about $500 credit per roll.  Making $2000 every 4‚Äì6 weeks on those four calls represents better than 12% annual return over my cost basis, plus obviously the stock itself continues to gain equity.  If I am being ‚Äúmath blind‚Äù I am happy to hear how. Bear in mind, buying back into the position if / when I get assigned means paying at least $100 more per share, and the premiums I collected, were only around $20 when I opened the position.  I know I am somewhat math blind when it comes to selling puts to manage this position but for some reason I can‚Äôt quite make my brain see the risk as being roughly, the same as selling covered calls.,;,; 2024-02-05 20:14:34]

So what is the difference between buying the $5 strike and the $170 strike? Obviously more intrinisic value with the $5 but not by much!   Extrinsic value is as follows, I'm looking at January 2025:  * $5 strike, extrinsic value 2.84, delta 1.0, theta 0.01 * $50, 4.39, 1.0, 0.01 * $100, $6.84, 1.0, 0.02 * $200, 12.44, .99, 0.04 * $300, 21.94, .96, 0.07 * $385, 35.69, .9, 0.10 * $400, 38.39, .89, 0.11  No really considering the 400 just putting it here for comparison. But the $200 isn't too bad at only 12.44 extrinsic value for nearly a year! I was considering a delta of .9 because its not too bad and I just thought .9 sounded pretty good still.

Best Performance vs. Implied Move:     |Ticker|Implied Move|Actual Move (Intraday)|Move Multiple of Implied Move| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |ZIM|9.5%|25.9%|2.7| |ANF|15.7|34.8%|2.2| |ADI|4%|14.95%|3.7| |APPS|18%|43.25%|2.4| |NVDA|10.1%|26%|2.6| |DLTR|5.9%|19.2%|3.3| |MRVL|7.6%|44.6%|5.8| |ULTA|6.1%|14.41%|2.4|  &amp;#x200B;  Of the 30 stocks tracked (ZIM, ZM, LOW, DKS, WSM, TOL, PANW, URBN, VFC, INTU, FUTU, ANF, KSS, ADI, XPEV, SPLK, APPS, NVDA, SNOW, BBY, MDT, WB, BURL, DLTR, GPS, ADSK, MRVL, WDAY, ULTA, &amp; PDD, 18 could have been profitable ER trades. That equates to 60%, while 40% were losers, and would have made money shorting ER through something like an Iron Condor, or whichever strategy you prefer.   Many of these stocks had good movement post ER, so there were numerous trade opportunities beyond the traditional long option play prior to earnings.,;,; 2023-05-27 00:35:05]

[Strategies after a quick 35% gain,;,; I‚Äôve been wheeling and selling CSPs the last couple months. Opened some CSP on TSLA, NVDA, and MSFT yesterday, and they all have a nice 25-35% gain after 1 day. Do most close out quickly to lock in the gains or roll them to a lower strike?  I like looking at contracts from a $/day perspective. I usually get around $10-20/day wheeling at .3 Delta, so a quick $200/day is always nice to lock in.,;,; 2023-05-26 14:52:42]
[Opinion: Managing LEAPS; selling a call (PMCC); cash, another contract, or something else?,;,; Context:  As part of an overall strategy with regards to LEAPS, in Nov, 2023 I bought (among others) 4 NVDA January 2026 $400 calls.  In Jan, 2024, I rolled those to $600 (same expiration), collected some cash, and used part of the proceeds to buy 1 more contract at $600, same expiration. So I'm sitting with 5 contracts, $600 strike, January 2026 expiration.   I had been selling calls against the LEAPS but in January I bought them back, so right now, none have any calls against them.  Poking around, I had the idea to sell 5x $1000 calls expiring December, 2024. I figure, given the LEAPS, if it closed at $1000 I'd be thrilled. Then I noticed that if I sold the $950s instead of the $1000s, I could use the proceeds to buy 1 more $600/January 2026 contract.  Would you:  a) Sell the call and keep the cash for other opportunities.   b) Sell the call and add 1 more LEAPS to make it 6.   c) Something else (what?)  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2024-02-06 18:27:08]
[AVGO 30% change of profit with iron condor next week (10% up or down calcualted),;,; What do you guys think of this iron condor ?   900/910 and 700/690 , that is roughly 10% up or down from current price.

[I accidentally let a put debit spread expire,;,; Normally, I buy my spreads back before closing and close the positions that way, but I've got a few things going on and didn't get it done this time, and so they expired and then my broker sold stock short on my behalf, which is fine. No big deal.  I actually have an existing short position on this shitco anyway, so it's just adding to that, but at a better cost basis. So goody goody for me, especially if this company keeps going in the toilet, which I fervently hope happens, not just because I'm making money but because I actually dislike this company. I just wish I knew about options and shorting when they were at a sky high valuation. The company is Peleton (PTON), by the way, in case anyone reading this is interested.  But I do have one very simple question: is there a downside to letting this happen that I'm not thinking through all the way? I mean, I kind of like this process, especially with this company, which I hate.  I suppose a downside would be getting stuck with a short position on a stock you didn't want to be short on because it could literally start going up at any time. NVDA would be a good example of that. I could see someone watching NVDA shoot upward and then making a bet that the stock was at a peak and buying some puts, or a put debit spread. But given the volatility, you might not want to be stuck with that short position on Monday morning.  Am I thinking about this the right way? Anything I'm missing?,;,; 2023-05-20 08:38:16]
[Managing CCs going against you?,;,; Hi folks,   How do you manage covered calls when the underlying is moving against your position? This is assuming that you‚Äôve entered the CC position for a profit, and not selling calls on a stock you own and want to keep.   I‚Äôll use NVDA prices as an example but it could be any stock + premium.   If I buy at 485 and sell the 495s call (with 10 day expiration) for 10 points, that gives me $1000 of absolute downside protection. If stock drops to 475 and I sell my shares, I‚Äôm left with a naked call. If I want to buy back the option, it could still be expensive (maybe 5p) especially if the decline occurs early into the position, so I‚Äôd have a $500 loss if it cost 5 to buy.   Would you unwind the trade before the stock reaches the cushion boundary, for example at 478, so that there is still $300 of premium profit to contribute towards closing out the call?  I understand this is a dynamic question as it largely depends on when the price moves, but I‚Äôd appreciate input from experienced CC traders. Cheers.  Edit: I meant a buy-write position, not covered call.,;,; 2023-09-03 13:59:08]
[Is it worth rolling my covered call?,;,; Currently I have 80 Sept 15th $18 covered call contracts that are deep in the money (Thanks NVDA, lol). At the time of expiration - as long as the contract doesn't fall drastically OTM, I'll be netting $34 per contract (breakeven is approx. $17.65) by the end of that day for a nice little gain of $2720, regardless of assignment or not.  After looking at the $18 strikes for 9/22 and 9/29 - safe to say I'd only be netting around $1500 (conservative number) after commissions and fees.   Is this worth rolling at the same strike, or should I just bite the bullet and get assigned? I figured that if I can stretch this out for a couple weeks to months, I can at least recover some "theoretical losses" from theta.  For those of you wonder - yes, I do have $160k in SOXL currently.,;,; 2023-08-24 01:41:28]
[Securing profits on long calls,;,; I have some options that are nearly up 100%, usually I just sell and walk away with what I get. I am considering getting a bit more sophisticated and maybe get some better performance. So please shoot holes in this!   Scenario  NVDA 560 calls currently asking 34.9, expecting it to hit about 620ish. That would make the options worth about 60 at expiration if this happens. So thinking ahead and wondering if I sold the 620 for 12.75 would that essentially guarantee me the 34.9 plus the 12.75? Or would that give me 12.75 on top of whatever price the 560's are at the time of expiration. If I leave them until expiration.   Common sense tells me they are just different positions and if it goes down to 530 I'd have a $0 option and the $12.75, for a total of $12.75 and if it goes up to 620 I would have the $60 + $12.75 = $72.75.   So at the end of the day, I am just wondering if there is something I am missing, some wise option move to make to secure this profit as well as get some increase, or am I just asking too much? ,;,; 2024-01-17 03:18:21]
[Long puts playing the odds strategy,;,; I'm fairly new to options trading and just wanted to double check that my strategy works as intended.  My idea is to buy long puts with 3 months to expiry under the following conditions:  1. The underlying stock has made at least 60% gains in the last 3 months.  2. P/e ratio &gt; 40  3. P/s ratio &gt; 5  4. P/b ratio &gt; 5  5. Price is above $20 at time of purchase.  6. The strike price that is $10 above a 30% drawdown has a $1 premium or less.  The idea here is that if the stock falls back down to the level it had 3 months prior, the put should make at least 10x, with the potential for more.  Let's say I scripted a backtest for this on tradingview and it has about a 20% success rate across 20 random large and mega cap stocks with 100 occurances.   Assuming the puts are available for a $1 premium, is my thinking correct that this would be a net profitable strategy?  I haven't quite backtested that much or that rigorously yet, but my intial tests indicate something close to this. Of course, I cant check what the premiums might be in these instances though.,;,; 2023-06-16 13:25:25]
[Hold or Roll?,;,; Strategy question.  I have several long calls \[AAPL, NVDA, TSLA\] that are now ITM, with 60-80 DTE.  I remain bullish on all three in the short term and my expectation is that they will continue to rise as expiration approaches.   On that assumption, how do I determine whether I'm better off holding, or rolling to a longer expiration/higher strike?  I realize that rolling locks in my profits, and that a longer expiration pushes the worst of theta decay into the future.  But is it really that simple?  Is there no scenario where I'm better off, e.g., sitting tight, waiting for my exit return percentage, and cashing out, as opposed to rolling up and out?  Again, assuming the underlying securities still have some room to rise in the near term.  Delta for these options range from .51 to .72, in case that's of interest.  Thanks in advance!    ,;,; 2023-08-31 18:40:38]
[A rolling collar,;,; Hi folks,  I converted my buy-write into a rolling collar last week when the concept of having a buy-write against NVDA at that high price kicked in. I bought at 468 and sold a 6 month put at 470 for 58 points.   So in the last 2 weeks I‚Äôve sold 2 ITM calls for 18p (both expired OTM), so 1/3 of my protective put is payed off, and I haven‚Äôt sold next weeks call yet in the hope the market opens a little higher.   I wanted to ask what the best way to manage a rolling collar is in declining stock. Obviously I want to pay off the puts premium so I the put is 1:1 with the shares. I was considering just selling next weeks 405 call for 40p, paying off the put entirely, but then if the stock rallied up (or stayed above the strike) then my put would be of lower value than my assignment price.,;,; 2023-09-16 13:38:47]
[Where is QQQ going this week? (My Friday tale of woe),;,; So, I buy and sell call options on QQQ. I love a day when the market is down big and I look for the moment when it turns and fights its way back up. I made $6400 last week. But‚Ä¶.on Friday I bought 10 options to expire 2/22 at 436 strike. Price was at around $433 or so at the time. It started to drop. I bought 10 more, cause I knew there would be a turn around. Nope. Dropped more. Then I bought 10 more. This time I was right and it rose nicely and at one point I was now up almost $2000. I was on a long road trip and had just stopped for a bathroom break. I decided to lock in a nice profit with a stop order at $1500 profit. We were getting out of the car and for some reason my order wouldn‚Äôt go through. I said, Eh nevermind. I‚Äôm fine. Well. 15 minutes later, back in the car, the absolute bottom fell out as you may have seen. Now I‚Äôm down like $1200. What the heck happened?!! So what to do? It dropped more. I was dumbfounded. I bought 10 more. I‚Äôd really like a nice recovery Tuesday/Wednesday. What do you all think? I‚Äôm nervous about NVDA and their earnings Wednesday aftermarket. I‚Äôm hoping to get out before then with some recovered loss or maybe even a profit. My cost average is certainly within reach with a nice $2 rise to say 431.50-432. My motto is don‚Äôt be greedy, but obviously stupidly it got away from me Friday.,;,; 2024-02-19 02:34:06]

On Wednesday two of the popular trading names take center stage with both Tesla and Netflix reporting after the close. We also hear from more airlines like United and get an early look at the chip sector with Taiwan Semi on Thursday. And finally a look at consumer credit and spending with American Express on Friday.  A pretty packed Tuesday through Friday so make sure to check the calendar each day. Next week things heat up even more with some mega-cap tech.

[$2K to $50K in 90 Days - Options Trading Challenge (Day 1 +$250 Unrealized),;,; **Intro**  As the market has been rallying recently, I have been noticing an increase in the number of questions regarding getting started trading. People are asking where to begin, how much capital is required, what to trade, etc. So I've decided now is a good time to do one of these small account challenges publicly. Hopefully, this will provide some guidance for new traders looking to get started without much capital. I'd also like to prove the traders claiming trading short-term options is impossible and technical analysis doesn't work wrong.  &amp;#x200B;  **Background**  I have been in the market for 5-6 years and started trading options heavily in 2020. I got lucky with my first few months of trading which enabled me to get a lot of experience without losing any of my initial capital investment. I had some big gains and even bigger losers. It's been quite a grind and a rollercoaster of emotions. I finally started to get better in late 2021 and into 2022. I've been able to quit my job and have been profitable for a while now. I have traded several small accounts up over 1,000% and blew up my fair share as well.  &amp;#x200B;  **Rules**  I started today with a $2,000 cash account at Schwab and will be using Street Smart Edge to trade and mostly TradingView for charting, will sometimes use thinkorswim as well. I'm giving myself 90 days to hit my account target of $50k. I will allow myself one blowup, but will only refund the account with an additional $1k. I think this is a good idea because it can be hard to build a cushion early on and everyone who wants to attempt this should have more capital they are willing to risk outside of this account. So $3k is my max loss, if I hit that I will consider it a fail and end the challenge.  &amp;#x200B;  **Trading** **Plan**  I mostly prefer to trade SPY or SPX options, anywhere from 0DTE to 2-4 weeks out. I also trade QQQs and some individual stocks. Some positions will be day trades, others I may hold for 2-4 weeks. This is a very aggressive approach, which is usually how I trade.  &amp;#x200B;  **Day 1 Trades**  AMD and NVDA have probably been on everyone's radar lately, showing insane strength. A large percentage of my profit so far this year has been on AMD calls, so I've been actively looking for dips to buy. AMD opened at a new ATH this morning but sold off over 5% after an analyst downgrade. If you look at the AMD daily chart, you'll see that it bounced almost right at the previous ATH at $164.46.  Around the same time, ES and NQ were trading slightly below their session lows, but UVXY was also near its session lows. UVXY also didn't react as it should have after a 20 point sell off from the highs on ES this morning. This told me that the break of the session low on ES and NQ was most likely going to cause a bounce. That gave me the confidence to long AMD at that level so I added 5 1/26 $170 calls. My analysis turned out to be correct. AMD started rallying with the rest of the market, ES and NQ did end up dropping almost back to session lows before the end of the day, but still no life in the VIX.  AMD dropped a little before close as well, but as of the close, I was up about $250 or 21% on the position. I need to see AMD continue to hold above $164.46 and NQ to rally along with it. I'm not going to mess around with this position if that doesn't happen, it is very risky to long a stock that has rallied this much recently.  https://preview.redd.it/1i4mm8yrl3ec1.png?width=1359&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=626c5cc41e600be70c2d17c4aa85d1271ef7224c  **Order Details**  That's it for now, adding the order details below for full transparency.

[Deep OTM Options as a Strategic Investment,;,; Having read a good chunk of Options as a Strategic Investment awhile back, I throughly it prudent to get around to doing the exact opposite and consider deep OTM options.   It‚Äôs lead to me serious perusement, do any investors here employ deep OTM options. People rant about them being long shots, gambles, the moonballs for clueless wsb plays, but I don‚Äôt understand the view of their lack of value.   Last week I felt quite uneasy of where the market was going this week, obviously it‚Äôs been dropping off but the idea of a correction rally seemed probable too, so I didn‚Äôt want to risk more expensive positions.  So as an experiment, I scrolled up and down the the options chain for this weeks expiration (last week) and looked at options around the 5-10 mark. More out of curiosity I bought a few calls and puts. $20 was my capital at risk, meh. I didn‚Äôt expect the options to become ITM, but I knew they would increase in value if the price approached the strikes in the first half of the week.   Today, I closed off my NVDA call (480 strike) and TSLA put for about 80 and 65. That‚Äôs a substantial return on investment. I understand a luckly bull/bear run doesn‚Äôt equate to a winning strategy, but I am curious if people employ deep OTMs as part of their trading/investment strategy.   Cheers all, good luck.,;,; 2023-08-15 16:40:41]
[Help me understand covered calls.,;,; I am trying to understand the risk of covered calls.  From what I see the only real risk is if the stock goes past the strike price you lose out on future gains?  Is that correct?  Is that the only risk?  Here is my scenario.  I have a little over 9k Ford stock.  If I sell 90 covered calls at a strike of 16.50 I would get a premium of $450.  This part I get.  If ford were to go to 16.51 I would have to sell correct?  Does it sell right away or at expiration?  If it goes past 16.50, but then come back under before expiration date what happens?  Does the call expire and that's it?  When looking at the P/L calculator on Fidelity for this call.  I see negative -63.92 at 15.00.  -3731 at the 16.50 strike.  This is the part that's confusing me.  I am not sure what's happening here and the math behind it.  Do I actually lose money at 15?  Or is it potential gains?  I am a bit over my cost basis, so a sale is not a huge deal to me really.

[Expected moves this week: FOMC Minutes, Zoom, Nvidia and more.,;,; Stocks had another stong week, finishing higher by about 2.3% Both SPX and SPY got stuck in the mud for the final 3 days of last week as they reached a heavy open interest level of 450/4500 and the gamma took effect, essentially pinning the indices to that level as November monthly options approached expiry. With those monthly options expired the backdrop changes into this week, but it also happens to be a shortened Thanksgiving week. Therefore, options are pricing a small move, a bit less than 1% into Friday. It's possible that gamma get re-established at the same level but it is unlikely we see that sort of gamma pinning we saw last week as the effect won't be as robust to start a new option calendar month.  The big economic data of the week comes on Tuesday with the release of the FOMC minutes. Fed watchers' attention turns now from rate hikes, with the assumption those are now over, to any signs of cracks in the economy which could allow the FOMC to begin cutting rates in 2024. As of now Fed fund futures give a small chance of a rate cut by March with a strong chance of one happening by May. That's something to keep an eye on as talk of rate cuts would likely coincide with worries about an economic cooldown. That table has not turned yet but it could become the focus into year end.

[Expected moves today, Powell, SPY, VIX,;,; Futures are lower for a 3rd straight day as the market waits for Fed Chair Powell's testimony in front of Congress. Some of his prepared remarks were released before the bell. The 3 day losing streak hasn't added up to much of a sell-off as of yet. The SPY is lower by about 1.5% since an intra-week high last Thursday. Nor has it affected vol much, the VIX is even lower than it was during that Thursday high in stocks.   As mentioned alot recently, yes vol is low, but the moves in the market are also very muted. The realized vol in SPY over the past month now sits at 12. Options in SPY are about 11 vol for the upcoming few weeks. In other words, IV is currently reflective of how the market is moving. Therefore option buyers are still having to get direction correct and be very nimble, despite how "cheap" vol is. Short-term option trading is basically a battle between implied vol, and realized vol. The mean reversion of IV (buying low IV, selling high IV) typically needs more time to play out. Speaking of that, when vol is this low for this long it's sometimes helpful to begin to look out a few months and see how low IV has been dragged down by what's happening recently. A look at SPY vol out in November and December shows at-the-money vol around 15-16. To put that in perspective, that's both below historical averages for IV, but it's also much lower than the realized vol if SPY over the past year, which is around 20, even with the slow grind of the past few months.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Action:**  * Tesla Inc (TSLA) +0.54% * Marathon Digital Hldgs Inc (MARA) +5.38% * Riot Platforms Inc (RIOT) +3.82% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +0.96% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.66% * Coinbase Global Inc Cl A (COIN) +2.89% * Opendoor Technologies Inc (OPEN) +4.23% * Alibaba Group Holding ADR (BABA) -0.65% * Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) +0.24% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.33% * Carvana Company Cl A (CVNA) +0.55% * Li Auto Inc ADR (LI) +3.14% * C3.Ai Inc Cl A (AI) -0.76%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * KB Home (KBH) Expected Move: 7.97% * Winnebago Industries, Inc.

Doing weeklies staying below .3 delta and it's been good but looking to get into something with higher premiums.  I have about 45k to play with so I was torn between these three options.

[Looking for opinions on deep ITM Call with an DTE MAR09.,;,; So i'll start by saying this is going to sound like a very Newb question regarding options, but beleive it or not I'm not fully new but also not as professional as some on this subreddit.  I straight up just bought this call C 09MAR - $630 IN NVDA yesterday when it was around $618... my train of thought was to get something passed the ER with some decent Vega (0.79) and make some profits off the volatility going up as earnings came closer.  Now I'm deep ITM and the Delta is 0.68, Vega still 0.73 and Theta of 0.54.. do I sell this Call and buy a higher strike point, or go with my original game plan and hope earnings will push it even further ITM and have the call basicly act like the stock.  I guess what I'm asking from the options vets is will I benefit more from selling it with some volitality increase going into earnings or just forget about the vega exposure at this point and see how far ER can push the price ITM and sell it a week before expiration and still make some extrinsic off Theta.  Im also not looking for no crazy speeads like Iron Condors, fluttering butterflies, jelly rolls or wheelin.. I also know many awnsers will be along the line of you should follow ur plan..depends on your risk aversion.. everyone trades differently etc...  I also know opinions are like A-Holes.. everyones got one.. some are shitty and other are great.. im just asking to see how some of you would play this..  TL:DR.. My call is deep ITM with over a month left to expire, would you sell, take your profit and buy a further strike price..or would you sell it on the volatility bubble going into ER to capitalise on Vega and Theta.. or would you ride it past ER through the volatility bubble and see if will get even more ITM?   I also know greedy hogs get slaughtered.. and this is usually not my trading plan.. but was trying something new and it hit.. thanks in advanced for anyone awnsering.,;,; 2024-02-02 18:05:33]
[Gains from Anomaly Detection as a Swing Trader,;,;   I just vehemently disagree with day trading.   I do not think it works well when you consider the time investment and the competition.   Once I made the switch to anomaly detection with heavy focus on non-standard data points - I finally started making real money.  The biggest difference is my patience. I use to try and force the market to give my profits each week. Now I stay patient, listen and observe all the data.   I‚Äôve blown my account up 5 times, which helped me refine my strategy again and again.   I still have losses but when I win, I win big.  Patience is key.   Don‚Äôt fall for all these brokers and data points which are the same recycled garbage. It‚Äôs a waste of your time. Think about it - every brokers trading platform is a consolation prize. They make money on PFO, they don‚Äôt make money from your analysis, so they don‚Äôt prioritize their platforms and data.  Show me a trader who thinks a trading platform is all they need to realize a healthy cagr, and I‚Äôll show you a trader in the red.

[Market Outlook: Bounce about to reverse?,;,; I've been holding cash for a while now, and I'm starting to get the feeling that this bounce is nearing its end. The economic headwinds seem very strong, and to me the path to soft landing seems to be narrowing. The media bought into the Fed crushing inflation with the last few CPI reports, but it's clear that this was mostly attributable to energy and food prices dropping. Core CPI is getting sticky and will only continue to be more of a nuisance as we drop into 5 and 4 percent territory. At the same time, people are feeling the effects of the tightening with credit card debt skyrocketing.  I plan to go short at some point in the next six months or even sooner if reports come out bad. I was just wondering if anyone who invested through dot com or 2008 is seeing parallels with our current economy. I feel like the perfect window to short tech is coming since the market ran up so hard on inflation news and AI speculation. I'm planning to buy long OTM puts expiring later in the year. Note I am limited by the premiums that I can afford which is less than $1000.  I was looking at the 9/15 $120 put on TSLA and the 9/15 $145 put on NVDA.

[Next steps - playing Mega-techs / Spy,;,; I played NVDA when it hit it's high, made about 30,000 on puts, and turned that around and played spy down through mega-tech earnings. Ended up with just under 100,000. Lost some in the last couple of days... I knew that spy was going to rebound over the 200 MA and still screwed up. I'm using trading view along with lux algo and, although helpful, I don't feel like I know enough about either (just started using them) to really make the best use of them... I have 4 years of solid experience, trading almost daily, I've had great ups and stupid downs, and now I've been trying to be much more precise and make constant gains. Up through the reversal back up over the last 2 days I had had 3 straight weeks of gains (200 - 210%), but I'm not sure where to go from here. My TA says Spy should drop but interest rates may drop, don't know where we are going in the short-term for a number of reasons, and I try not to play expensive premium options, when possible. I trade on extrinsic value (when I'm ITM). Outside of Apple's earnings, which I personally think will be bearish, I'm feeling a bit burnt out and like I need to tap a new vein of the market. I know this is a broud post with no real direction, but I would love some feedback on some ideas of how to continue my upward momentum. I don't want to get hyperfixate (as I usually do, super ADD) and play Spy as it trades sideways / up, in the short-term. I could just sit on my hands... Im long (20 years) on 40,000 shares of Goog A/C (26k / 14k)  that I could write covered calls / puts on, but, honestly, haven't done that before, and, there are some other financial considerations I'd have to think about. I know there are other assets/commodities/etc to play out there, but I would love to hear any feedback on which areas of the market to turn to next / opinions on TV/LA learning curve, usage, and all the other things I mentioned in my little post.

[Options selling and risk management,;,; \--- Update below ---    In the past my options trading was very volatile with just buying calls and puts with no real strategy. I made money and lost money by luck. I have been studying options for few months now and finally landed on selling strategy.  I have been selling spread options and iron condors for 2 months now and I have 90% success ratio. I am not sure if this is luck or I have found the option trading style that works for me. My positions carry around 20-30% risk. So for $5000 risk trade I keep $1000. I am using few options tools which show me percentage of profitability based on Black-Scholes-Merton model. These positions are normally around 90% chance.  I am sure this will not last long and I am afraid one big swing in market will erase all my profit of 2 months.  I have positions in SPY / GLD / NVDA / COST for this month. Lets say each position I am carrying $5000 risk so total $20,000 risk and I am making $4000 if they all expire worthless.  If the market drops like a hot potato then I may have to roll over my positions or take total loss.  Note that I dont have stop order loss due to nature of volatile market, I like to keep a close eye on them.  What do you guys suggest, how should I improve on this process ? Thanks for any suggestions, here to learn.  &amp;#x200B;  \--- Update ---   Yup , luck ran out and blew up the account thanks to market melt up. Exactly this happened what I was afraid of, good thing is lots of knowledge acquired to fill the gap. My SPY short call was assigned early and I did not get a chance to roll out. I ended up exercising my long and short and took loss which basically puts me now at net zero YTD.   &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-05-24 18:52:54]
[My META play, taking advantage of IV crush,;,; I've been playing with ways to take advantage of IV crush with minimal downside. I've had some success with NVDA, ADBE and NFLX this year. The trade I have in META seems to fit well. The prices I listed are where I have them a few minutes before close, I legged into the trade.  Summary: I am making +$102/day calculated Theta, but still have a positive gamma. Overall, my net position is Short 7 shares (-$2292). Usually you can't collect premium without taking some risk, but in this situation I'd benefit from a large rise or fall on release of earnings.  The trade: Meta earnings July 26. META Settled today $310  Implied Volatility in the July 28 options is \~63% (Sell these)  Implied Volatility in the October 20 options is \~39% (Buy these)  Sell 1 July 28th 310 Call ($1568 Credit) Theta +$84/day  Sell 1 July 28th 310 Put ($1462 Credit) Theta +$78/day  Buy 1 Oct 20th 350 Call ($1188 Debit) Theta -$18/day  Buy 1 Oct 20th 370 Call ($753 Debit) Theta -$15/day  Buy 2 Oct 20th 285 Put ($1252 Debit) Theta -$28/day  I like this trade because a large move in the stock should pump up the October options. I'm collecting $3000 from the the July 28 options, and for that position to settle negative overall would mean I have ITM (or near ITM) options for October with plenty of time left in a stock that just moved 10%.  In no way am I suggesting this is risk free or "How can I lose!?". I can think of many ways to lose on this trade, but I'm collecting substantial premium, risk is 'capped' and a wild price move would actually be a benefit.,;,; 2023-07-18 03:05:04]

[Help me decide on the best options to get for max profit.,;,; Fellow options enthusiasts.  Need to pick your cumulative brains to figure out what my best bet is for the following scenario:  I have $6000 to play with.  I believe Apple has a solid short opportunity here. There is a possibility that we break above $200, but it will still highly likely reverse from there.  I am looking at a short target of $165-$160, apx 5-6 months from now.  What is the best option strategy for me that will not kill me on time decay and generally go in my favor. I also would like the strike price to be OTM to take advantage of the discount for OTM strikes, I don‚Äôt believe buying options ITM is in my benefit. But I‚Äôm happy to hear your thoughts.

[Expected Moves this Week - GDP, a low VIX, IWM and earnings from Nike, FedEx and Micron,;,; We enter what will be the last 5-day trading week of the year. Both Christmas Week and New Year will feature 3 day weekends with the holidays both falling on Monday. Due to the rally we've seen into year-end and the upcoming calendar implied vol is low across the board. The realized vol in the indices has been low as well, with moves mostly to the upside and red days not able to string together any sort of meaningful pullback. Small caps have shown the greatest relative strength recently. Note the IWM expected move below which has been seeing much more realized moves than the other major indices. IWM got near the 200 level last week but found some sellers above 199 on Friday. Keep an eye on that index for any breakout. Small caps ripping higher can inject some volatility back into the market as investors reach for upside calls for fear of missing out. The VIX printed below 12 briefly last week. Some of the lowest VIX prints tend to come in December and Early Jan historically.

[Expected Moves - SPY, QQQ for Jackson Hole - Earnings: Nvidia, Snow, Zoom and more.,;,; Another packed earnings calendar highlighted by Nvidia on Wednesday. There's also Jackson Hole central banker speak, highlighted by Jay Powell on Friday. IV has picked up recently a bit but still remains slightly below historical averages. SPY options are pricing about a 1.5% this week, with QQQ options a little more than 2%:  https://preview.redd.it/r4dmqblmmbjb1.png?width=1176&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7b7969b41f5c3610c8d0dc0fb8296cf872ecda77  0DTE expected moves are about 0.6% in SPY, up from 0.4% each day a few weeks ago.

[programmable system to trade options(all failed ideas),;,; I am a 48 years old programmer, I have been learning and buying options and stocks. most options are OTM calls, as I learned the non-linear payoff is the key for retailer. I am trying to establish a programmable system to trade options so that I can live on the cash I have . I have tested out IBKR api to monitor data and send orders.  &amp;#x200B;  given the maturity of the market, I am going through lots of ideas. I have not found one that seems to convince me it will work. as I am full believer of Taleb philosophy, We can only falsify and proof by negate, if there is such idea that can succeed, more than likely I have not tried hard enough to falsify it.  I hope to gain some idea from you guys. I am not selling volatility ever.  1. volatility surface calibration, get tick price from IBKR, based on bid size and ask size, to get reasonable price and using STI model to calibrate volatility surface. then buy options with low volatility. reason fail, volatility of underlying may change rapidly and also some major event may be in the near future, not sure why the academic is obsessed with volatility surface calibration. do you see a way to success? last price of option may not be accurate, give the size of trade, and also MM may be overrun by insiders. 2. I see lots of trade flow monitor site, I believe institutional traders can use program to divide large block into small size. or insider( some executive from biotech company) may place large size bet on options, but is this going to be reliable? some site even promote large block size on AAPL,  AAPL is so liquid that I don't think anyone has any insider information, within last 5 years, AAPL has never made some jumps based on nonpublic information, and they may using calls as a hedge.  so this flow alone can not be reliable. 3. one more thing to try based on 1 and 2, detect large size trade with higher volatility trade , then buying other further out calls with lower strike. 4. maintain a book , with options and stocks, calculate all the greeks, based on volatility surface calibration, not based simply on BS formula. I see Taleb book on dynamic hedging, it involves 7th derivatives, I think that can only be calculated using real data. using programming skills, it is easy to see it is delta neutral, maybe 2nd  or 3rd derivative neutral, maybe this is why the volatility surface is so important, given current surface, the risk of the portfolio is know more  accurately. 5. another way is to play the distribution, i.e, extrapolate the prob. dist. of underlying over 2sd, and using power law to calibrate prob. out of 2 sd, then recalculate option price. one to see it is to use the DTE as one unit of time, say you have 300 day dte, just treat that as one unit of time and estimate the prob. of change of underlying to fit the option price, with computer age, with a prob. dist. of different unit time, option price is easy to calc. 6. market dynamics is not something we play as retailer, and I don't want to speculate, like NVDA gained 25% post earning.  I understand building such a system without any speculation view of the market is extremely hard for retailer,   the process of thinking about and falsifying ideas has somehow made me better understand market risks.  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-07-29 15:36:11]
[PMCC DIS,;,; I'm bullish on DIS.  It's currently hovering around its long-term low (not quite Covid level, but very close).  I do think they are figuring out and working through some of their cash issues with ESPN and streaming, and the parks will continue to be a profitable category.  Assuming DeSantis does not get elected (which I don't think he will) that negative news will also go away.  That being said, I am looking at doing a PMCC DIS with buying an $80 7/21 Call and simultaneously selling a 10/20 $100 call.  I have done normal covered calls in the past, but I assume the way a PMCC works is I will just close both legs on or before 7/21.  Is that correct?,;,; 2023-06-20 15:14:54]
[Expected Moves this Week: SPY, QQQ, Nvidia, Apple, Costco, Nike, Micron and more.,;,; Last week saw a pop in volatility and several down days following the FOMC announcement. SPY finished the week down 2.9%, nearly 3x the move options were pricing. The VIX closed on Thursday Sept 14th below 13, into a Sept 15th triple witching expiry that saw the expiration of alot of gamma that may have been keeping a lid on market volatility while some bad news piled up. Once that gamma got unwound/expired implied vol began ticking up into the FOMC meeting and then even higher with stocks going lower out of the meeting.   The VIX is now above 17, still slightly below its historical mean but now matching its highest levels since late May. In other words, the low vol, slow grind higher we saw over the entire summer looks to have come to an end, at least for now, with September expiration. Keep an eye on both weekly IV as well as 30-60 day IV as both got very low into that Sept 15th expiry. Stocks that had seen a slow grind higher all Summer were suddenly making large moves in the span of days or weeks that options weren't pricing to happen in the span of multiple months in the future.   For traders, it's helpful to look at recent stock moves and compare to the expected move in the future to see instinctually if options are inexpensive out in the future. Just as an example, NVDA has made several 15% moves in the past month, yet options are not pricing that sort of move to happen again until December expiry:  https://preview.redd.it/ga156iq9i8qb1.png?width=806&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=deef6e981dc525ff4abdf70c04272cdf0eb39f1a  And Apple has made several moves in the 8-10% range recently, yet options aren't pricing a 10% move until well into the beginning of 2024:     https://preview.redd.it/w72vsxu8i8qb1.png?width=826&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d55c0113ee3780eea6c3efc9d40b5df1b8a249cc  There's no guarantee the volatility will continue, it could stop on a dime again. But, options clearly are still in a hangover from the low vol days of Summer and are still playing catch-up. The weeklies have made the biggest spike so far, now pricing in expected moves about 50% higher than just a few weeks ago. Here's this week's look:  * **SPY expected move this week: 1.5%** * **QQQ expected move this week: 1.9%**  &amp;#x200B;  **Earnings This Week**   *Tuesday*  * **COST** Costco **3.0%** * **CTAS** Cintas Corporation **4.5%** * **FERG** Ferguson plc **5.4%** * **SNX** TD SYNNEX Corporation **6.0%**  *Wednesday*  * **MU** Micron Technology, Inc. **5.3%** * **PAYX** Paychex, Inc. **4.5%** * **CNXC** Concentrix Corporation **9.0%**  *Thursday*  * **NKE** NIKE, Inc. **5.2%** * **KMX** CarMax, Inc. **8.2%** * **BB** BlackBerry Limited **8.8%**  *Friday*  * **CCL** Carnival Cruise Lines **8.3%**  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-09-24 17:04:37]
[1 Yolo strategy for my birthday?,;,; Saturday was my birthday and I got $150 from various grandmas and I wanna do a single yolo play. I'm thinking of buying a call option with 1 year to expiration, possibly ITM or close to it. Reasons being that those contracts are usually more affordable, 1 year to expiration gives the stock time to move my direction, and I'm not rich enough to be purchasing contracts on bigger named tickers (spy tsla, amd, etc).  This would just be for fun, if it hits i'll buy a nice steak dinner. if not, it was birthday money.

[TSLA short straddles going into earnings,;,; tldr;  shorted TSLA ATM $285 strike 7/21 expiration) around earnings.  Short resulted in a net credit of $21.97 per C/P pair of contracts.  Closed at market open morning after earnings report for debit of $12.81  Profit of  9.16 (71.5%)  Risks that should considered:  1. American options can be executed at any time before expiration. So you could end up short or long the underlying. Be prepared for what to do in that case. 2. If underlying  experiences a sudden increase in volatility due to news or event, your short may be at a loss and closing limit order not execute leaving you short options that may end up ITM and assigned. 3. \-----------  The idea is probably obvious, but I'll explain in case it's not.  IV is relatively high as a company heads into earnings. Shorting day of earnings, wouldn've probably been better.  TSLA reported after market close 7/19. Hence IV is theoretically highest that day before earnings.  IV drops, along with options premiums after results are reported. If a company dramatically beats or misses expectations, one leg of the straddle will increase, while the other drops.  Because results were reported after market clothes, options trades can't be executed until the next day's open on 7/20. Hers's my diary and results of the trade.  1. 7/17: Placed limit  and executed order at current market price  to short C/P straddle($285 strike 7/21 expiration). Resulted in a net credit of $21.97 per C/P pair of contracts. 2. Immediately placed a limit GTC order to close for a profit I would be happy with (12.97, $9, 70% profit) . It's important  not get greedy, watch minute charts, and to  try to time the market perfectly. Take your profit and be happy. 3. The closing order executed at market open the morning after earnings on 7/20. It executed at a price slightly lower than my  my limit ($12.81) . This means the lowest ask price was lower than the limit I had initially set ND NET profit greater than my initial closing limit order.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-07-21 18:11:30]
[Expensive Options Case Study: TSM,;,; TSM seems like a great stock to sell options on. Because implied volatility is so high, we'll make a ton of theta while the stock remains relatively calm.   This simple trade will make around 1% in a month. Here is my research:  ## What is TSMC?  TSMC is a semiconductor manufacturing company with huge companies such as AMD, Apple, NVIDIA, and more as its clients. Here‚Äôs how the stock has been moving recently:  https://preview.redd.it/zwn9unjsxl1b1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a3cf3c28124f0d03727868ec7cc9780a576383c  While the stock made an impressive run at the beginning of the year, it‚Äôs calmed down a bit. The stock has stayed around the $90-ish mark, ranging from roughly $85 to $95.  The implied volatility of TSM has been high for the last several months. The current implied vol is 27.51, but the realized vol is around 25.03.  https://preview.redd.it/e8mt1mftxl1b1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13e66f5e6aa83d54d896d429c7760bf1da112b61  We can see that there‚Äôs been a significant premium, and even though the spread is gradually closing, implied volatility remains above realized volatility. Options sellers are winning here since theta is eating away at too much of the options' value compared to the gamma they have to put up with.   Of course, we're not supposed to directly compare implied volatility (a forward-looking figure) to historical realized volatility. However, we can use historical data to try and forecast future volatility three different ways:  ## Predicting Alpha Volatility Forecast  The Predicting Alpha terminal forecasts volatility using a blend of IVs and RVs. This is a quick and easy way for volatility traders to understand where implied volatility should be trading. For TSM, the PA forecast is¬†**22.69%.**  ## Realized Volatility  Another estimate for future volatility is simply using the 30-day realized volatility. Since volatility tends to cluster, historical volatility tends to be a good estimator of future volatility. The 30-day window ensures we have enough data without using old, irrelevant data. For TSM, the 30D realized volatility is¬†**25.03%.**  ## Implied Volatility  Since implied volatility is the market‚Äôs expectation of future volatility, implied volatility can be a good predictor of future volatility. Implied volatility tends to be just a tad higher than realized, though, because of the variance risk premium. This is the case with TSM; on average, IV is about 1.06x RV:  https://preview.redd.it/ve6937kuxl1b1.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=711b19614d3dbbfa5de1904d11b5b65ff65ae7e1     By removing the variance risk premium from implied volatility, we can find our third forecast of volatility:¬†**25.9%.**  ## Forecast of Volatility  By taking an average of our three estimates, we have an average of 24.54%. Compared to our current 27.51 vol, that‚Äôs a 3-point difference!  The market price of the $92 June monthly straddle is around 5.28, but at a 24.54 vol, the straddle should be only worth 4.71. By selling the straddle, we make about $57 monthly on less than $5000 in margin.  ## Position Sizing and Management.  As for position management, I would continue to hold this trade if TSM happens to be less volatile than implied. If we start to see multiple days in a row of outsized moves, I will cut the position early, even at a loss. Of course, if implied volatility drops, we can get out once the edge is gone.  ## Conclusion  This is just one of many trades that should be a part of a short-vol book. The research is solid, but the edge isn‚Äôt enough to YOLO our life savings.  Trade it small; find many similar trades to spread your risk!  Good luck, and happy trading.,;,; 2023-05-23 16:29:10]

[Expected Moves This Week: Fed Decision, KRE, XLF, Nike, Gamestop and more.,;,; ## Market View  **Last Week ‚Äì Slightly higher for stocks put plenty of volatility**.  SPY was up 1.1% on the week, a move less than half of what options were pricing. However, the market had multiple swings of more than 3% within the week and closed the week badly with a selloff on Friday. The VIX closed the week slightly higher but also saw large swings, nearly 30 on the upper end and 22 on the lower end. Last week‚Äôs volatile swings in the broader market were largely based on the wild swings in banks both large and small, with large bank Credit Suisse entering the conversation. Some of the best-performing stocks last week were in large-cap tech as a rotation to those names was spurred by lower interest rates and declining treasury yields.  Continuing signs of stress in the banking sector could spook stocks and confuse the options market, attempting to price both the downside market risk of bank runs and the potential for melt-ups happening elsewhere as rotations take place among investors eyeing declining yields (and a potentially dovish Fed). As one example among many, Microsft (MSFT) was higher by more than 12% last week, while KRE (the regional bank etf) was lower by 14%. Those type of competing moves resulted in an overall market that was almost flat on the week, but underneath the hood was some chaos.  Back to treasuries, short-term yields saw some of their wildest swings in years. For instance, the 2-year yield closed the week at 3.85%, down from 5% on March 7th. That‚Äôs a fast move. The bond market is essentially calling the Fed‚Äôs bluff on where rates will be in the near future. Speaking of the Fed‚Ä¶  **This Week ‚Äì A Big Decision by The Fed**  A consortium of mid-sized banks sent a letter over the weekend to the FDIC requesting a rules change to guarantee deposits for the next two years in an attempt to stem further bank runs. A couple of weeks ago it was assumed the Fed would keep its foot on the gas on rate hikes and the market was settling into an assumption of higher rates for longer as inflation numbers remained somewhat stubborn. All that has now changed and the Fed has big decisions to make in the next few meetings. The FOMC announcement is Wednesday and a Powell presser follows. The market still assumes a 25 basis point hike (after some thought 50 just a few weeks ago) but a pause wouldn‚Äôt be a shock at this point. The reaction by the market to any of those scenarios would be tough to read ahead of time because the reasons given by the Fed are arguably more important.  SPY options are pricing about a 2.6% move for the week, similar to last week. The majority of the move is being priced by options for the actual FOMC day. Here‚Äôs this week‚Äôs SPY levels for a 2.6% expected move, about $400 on the upside and $380 on the downside. Note the bulge in the expected move chart mid-week, as option IV jumps from about 19 before the meeting to 26 after:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/uc777ose8roa1.png?width=1266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0b01c44eb30b1881bc3ffb6ead272a50b276b7b  **Expected Moves for This Week**¬†([via Options AI free tools](https://tools.optionsai.com/))  * SPY¬†**2.6%** * QQQ **2.9%**¬† * IWM¬†**3.6%**  * DIA¬†**2.3%**   &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar**  * Monday ‚Äì **Lagarde (ECB) speech** * Wednesday ‚Äì **FOMC Interest Rate Decision, Powell Presser** * Friday ‚Äì **Durable Goods, Capital Goods**  &amp;#x200B;  **Weekly** **Expected Moves (in the News)¬†(**[**via Options AI free tools**](https://tools.optionsai.com/)**)**  * XLF¬†**4.3%** (was down 6% last week) * KRE **10%**¬†(was down 14% last week) * TLT¬†**2.4%**¬†(was up 1% last week)  &amp;#x200B;  **Unusual Option Volume on Friday**  FRC, RIOT, MOS, DASH, ALT, GLD, BK, MSFT, NVDA, ICLN, COIN, MSTR  ##   ## Earnings This Week  Via the [Options AI Earnings Calendar](https://tools.optionsai.com/).

[Earnings expected moves, Amazon, Apple, Coinbase, Draftkings and more.,;,; A couple of giants report after the close, amidst a heavy earnings calendar. On the economic front, we get the NFP jobs number tomorrow morning.  Here's a preview of Amazon and the options setup, which can be a good sense of the overall set-up into an earnings event. The expected move is about 6%. That compares to the most recent earnings moves of -4%, -8%, -7% and +10%. So today's expected move is just shy of the mid of the past 4 earnings moves with the most recent earnings having moved less (-4%).   The IV of the weeklies is about 100. That compares to the 30 day IV of about 43. Of course, the weekly options expire tomorrow, so really they should be thought of as an expected move, and less so as vega. That 30 day IV (44), which is a purer representation of vega, is higher than the 30 day realized vol (how the stock has actually moved over the past 30 days) of just 27. Amazon's realized vol over the past month is quite quiet compared to how its moved over the past year, with its yearly realized vol being 39.   That paints a picture of very high IV compared to the stock's very recent history, but options priced for earnings that are leaning towards a move slightly less than the stock has moved over the past year on earnings. This comes in an overall lower IV and realized vol environment over the past few months.  An Iron Condor, set at the expected move, and $1 wide on the wings, would need AMZN to stay within about 120.50 and 136.50. The bullish expected move lines up very near to the highs of 2023 in the stock, which happened within the past month. Here's how that looks on the chart.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/9xla9tfv4wfb1.png?width=1138&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a633c4f78fbeae60a6c6b1a1e9f7d24752f669fa  Apple's expected move of 3% compares to earnings moves over the past year of +5%, +3%, +8% and +3%. Again, low IV compared to earnings over the past year, but AAPL's realized vol over the past month is just 13! Options buyers have not been doing well in those conditions and the low IV into earnings is a reflection of that suffering. 3% is about $6 in either direction.  Here's some other highlights today:  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  https://preview.redd.it/pya4gngx1wfb1.png?width=964&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=275e0bdb45d38790c48b5964c531166b68d9f98c  **Early Movers:**  * Amer Superconductor (AMSC) -21.5% * Paypal Holdings (PYPL) -7.9% * Qualcomm Inc (QCOM) -8.9% * Moderna Inc (MRNA) +2.0% * Robinhood Markets Inc Cl A (HOOD) -4.7%  **Economic Calendar:**  * At 10:00 AM (EST) ISM Services PMI (Jul) Estimates: 53, Prior: 53.9  **Scanner Highlights:**  * **Overbought (RSI):** OSTK (77), JWN (75), IBM (74), KSS (71) * **Oversold (RSI):** HON (31), LUV (40), EBAY (41), TXN (41), MCD (41), SNOW (41), BUD (41) * **High IV:** NKLA (+198%), SAVE (+158%), PYPL (+142%), BUD (+142%), PLTR (+140%) * **Unusual Options Volume:** RAD (+1928%), TRIP (+798%), AMD (+773%), SHOP (+771%), CAT (+611%), QCOM (+563%), MTCH (+551%), NVDA (+494%), MSTR (+408%), PYPL (+402%), MRNA (+398%)  Full lists here: [Options AI Free Tools](http://url5578.options.ai/ls/click?upn=WHju0C1BRPoBuTdL0xEcqZNWu421ak771SLA5jzpsv95uGEO0ajLP5akEsRW2y6pDZX4QFJa1v3fzfaO9A8yOz0yTeY6cCr88OnTS9pQEP5ZHg20lFbWP5WN5WCScJeUxRNSUM-2BQca-2FYsl6GKpuIew-3D-3DVq52_yIbKbwLGaUiHkJ2rj-2FVSLO9FkCqgwrqJUZFsR-2FM-2BW6g1NUq5hkNfzxZGFziJBIqnJxtsA-2B6Nrh8CHL3OufU5QY5TkfelaO1-2BVX2-2BiE-2FOZYaESMPanMchodgzcuMV0SgXO0AWKQd0mPpCRbCJDvN9W4tD3C1dvzaS1mrXk5juhYal1rPGfJPeMpGVa-2Fo8sPWcv2CbVWnHUcodE0Np8mf3aJTecqp68JL2z-2FpTjQ8Jpm4YrPd9i6KBGek4dZUDld5zEUtqYgKbUeIlurPrh48mdWIUvwh7x0elQER0xsE0k66-2FEDh8wNl6vChJFHTr4cV904OU2PB0-2F-2BV6XD1UE7TgAQ-3D-3D).  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-08-03 12:46:54]
[Expected Moves this week, SPY, VIX, QQQ, MU and more.,;,; SPY was lower last week by about 0.6%, again, inside what options were pricing. Implied vol closed extremely low into the weekend, with SPY some at-the-money SPY weekly options sporting single-digit handles. That IV should reset a bit higher out of the weekend but overall vol remains historically below average and at multi-year lows. The VIX closed last week below 13.50. Of course, vol could always go lower, but it's getting to the point where those lower moves would be quite small. In general the 12-13 range in the VIX floor over the past 5 years and only on rare occasions over longer time horizons do you see it closer to 10. That's not to say it can't remain this low for a long time, but it can't get much lower. One thing to note from the past 2 weeks, the daily realized moves of the market versus what 0DTE options had been pricing has started to tip a bit in the favor of the market moves over the expected moves, particularly in the QQQ. That kind of action tends to put a floor on IV as well as option trading in same-day expiry is heavy volume and being more or less re-priced each day based on the prior day's result. Futures are flat to lower to start off the week.  This past weekend included some political chaos in Russia but markets this week will most likely concentrate on a combo of economic data like GDP &amp; Durable Goods and speeches by Lagarde (tues) and Powell (wed, thurs). SPY options are pricing about a 1.1% move for the week at 10 vol (at the money) although that could get a lift on the open. The earnings calendar this week is slow but steady, with Micron (MU) a highlight on Wednesday.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Actives:**  * Lucid Group Inc (LCID) +7.86% * Tesla Inc (TSLA) -2.27% * Trxade Health Inc (MEDS) +60.43% * Eco Wave Power Global Ab ADR (WAVE) +22.11% * Marathon Digital Hldgs Inc (MARA) -3.30% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.19% * Alphabet Cl A (GOOGL) -1.65% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.33% * Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) +0.11% * Coinbase Global Inc Cl A (COIN) -1.84%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (CCL) Expected Move: 9.75% * Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (CUK) Expected Move: 13.06%  Full list here: [Options AI Earnings Calendar](http://url5578.options.ai/ls/click?upn=WHju0C1BRPoBuTdL0xEcqZNWu421ak771SLA5jzpsv-2BU8w7tMzcR-2B7I-2FswbV9O3IjjJgP1PQKL9ll-2BR2phXTZw-3D-3DKLWK_yIbKbwLGaUiHkJ2rj-2FVSLO9FkCqgwrqJUZFsR-2FM-2BW6g1NUq5hkNfzxZGFziJBIqnJxtsA-2B6Nrh8CHL3OufU5QY5TkfelaO1-2BVX2-2BiE-2FOZYaESMPanMchodgzcuMV0SgXO0AWKQd0mPpCRbCJDvN9W1Z98ZBpNBIeQLmVKArXCdBoeiAfhmQE6JRAttg1UbJEjTVrc27qzW4D-2FEN8SBfZSM6rIsJo4FrkzFXXt11iCWOc7y7YqP1MrSTCMbbBGn6MZUdOYZN05LwOyzdMa7islZHTa25xqMejT9wnPiujbRGZvZEPHEnw5zMZBeGW4DYGbl5aBhxiaCtauc5J0Z4uzA-3D-3D)  &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar:**  * At 10:30 AM (EST) Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index (Jun) Estimates: -26.5, Prior: -29.1  &amp;#x200B;  **Scanner Highlights:**  * Overbought (RSI): CCL (79), META (78), KMX (73), JNJ (72), ADBE (72), LLY (71), AAPL (70) * Oversold (RSI): OXY (31), PENN (31), DOCU (35), CHPT (36), MRNA (36), GS (36) * High IV: MANU (+212%), ATVI (+194%), VMW (+167%), NKE (+107%), AZN (+105%), IBM (+105%), TSLA (+103%) * Unusual Options Volume: KMX (+981%), MARA (+510%), COIN (+468%), SNAP (+416%), CCL (+343%), META (+310%), MSTR (+309%)  &amp;#x200B;  **Chart of the Day**  Some SPY options have seen IV marks below 10 recently.  https://preview.redd.it/nm27qm5ohc8b1.png?width=821&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2056165de534a76a1ba8296c8dd5feed80aa6b47,;,; 2023-06-26 11:09:21]
[Expected moves today: SPY, QQQ, Micron and more.,;,; As market participants await words from Jay Powell, stock futures have slipped slightly into the red with tech pulling back from its recent rally. Chip stocks like Nvidia are leading the way lower following a report in the WSJ that the U.S. is considering restricting AI-focused chips from being exported to China. Powell's remarks will be interesting considering the economic data of late like consumer confidence and housing starts showing the economy still plugging away. He is speaking at an ECB / Central banker gathering with Christine Lagarde also appearing. The 1-year treasury is around 5.30, higher than before the SVB mess, and the 2-year yield is 4.74, still below its pre-SVB peak but has been moving towards those levels.  The VIX remains below 14 with SPY at the money vol about 11.

[Expected moves: Pepsi, Delta, JP Morgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, Amazon and more.,;,; Futures are once again bid higher. Stocks were green pre-market even before the PPI release which followed up well to yesterday's CPI, and was also cooler than expected. Both are encouraging signs about inflation. Earnings season started this morning for all intents and purposes with Pepsi and Delta Airlines being the most interesting names reporting so far. Both stocks are higher, and both have beaten their expected move slightly (so far). This is something to keep an eye on as earnings season kicks off. As mentioned yesterday, IV and expected moves in individual stocks are the lowest they've been in years. That does not mean options are completely wrong per se, vol is low for a reason across the market... But what it does mean is that individual stocks are more likely to move beyond their expected move on earnings than on average. Simply because the moves are that much smaller than typical. It also means the vol crushes after earnings are less, which may be helpful in deciding whether or not to hold positions through the event.   It's also entirely possible that any outsized moves happen more often in one direction than the other, which has more to do with the overall trend in the market. right now that trend is higher as we enter earnings so keep an eye on whether stocks beat expected moves to the upside more than the downside, or vice versa.

Senhance from $ASXC FDA APPROVED 2017, ready for sale to public just two years before pandemic. In 2018. Only one in the world with 3mm tools and port for a smaller wound to heal from, specifically for infant children, months old. Da Vinci has 8-12-mm gap surgical wounds on their Multi Port, and 2 inch surgical wound from Da Vinci Singple Port. The Mayo Clinic recently added THEIR FIRST SENHANCE TO THEIR Pediatrics Dept LAST WEEK. Other things Senhance has that Da Vinci does not have: Haptic Feedback, Eye Tracking, Re-Usable Instruments- no need to buy instruments for every 12- new surgery or every 15th. Tools can be reused, last for lifetime of tool. You also have a clear line of sight during your operation where you can actually see your patient and staff during the surgery vs a Da Vinci the Surgeon is forced to hunch over and dig his her head inside an orifice cubby hole, and look through binoculars, obstructing important peripheral vision in the operating room. Also New Collab with NVDA for ISU Artificial Intelligence. Every surgical procedure from every Senhance worldwide, and there have been 10,000 procedures on a Senhance to date get uploaded to the cloud. Videos, photos, surgical procedure of every surgeon gets uploaded, for future reference and information for the Surgeon to compare his time or process of same procedure with others.

Da Vinci from $ISRG , incumbent , with FDA approval since 2000. Bought the tech from Stanford. No 3mm. No Haptic Feedback, no eyetracking. Tools need to be replaced at highest use every 15th-18th procedure or need new tools for every new surgery. Incumbent monopoly for over 23 yrs. It has outdated rested on it's laurels tech.More on ISRG monopolistic tactics here:Hospitals are taking on a surgical robot "monopoly"  3. Just remember all the Surgeons at the Mayo Clinic gave the thumbs up here. 3mm port technology, ASENSUS IS THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD WITH THIS TINY 3MM. IT IS NOT EASY TO ENGINEER, IT INVOLVES MINITIARIZING THE CLIPPING ARMS THAT GRAB, THE SCISSORS THAT CUT &amp; THE CAUTERIZERS &amp; TOOLS THEMSELVES. IT'S NO SMALL FEAT TO GET OR HAVE 3MM. ERGO, WHY THE LAZY INCUMBENT RESTED ON IT'S LAURELS ISRG, NOR IMITATION CHASING CMR, HAVE 3MM. REMEMBER THAT IT'S MUCH BETTER 4 PATIENTS, ESPECIALLY MONTH OLD INFANTS TO HEAL FROM SUCH A TINY 3MM SURGICAL INCISION/ WOUND, VS AN 8MM-12MM OR MORE FROM DA VINCI MULTI PORT, OR 2 INCHES FROM SINGLE PORT. REMEMBER: ONE INCH EQUALS 25MM. 2 INCHES IS 50MM, ACTUALLY 51MM TO BE MORE EXACT. THESE ARE THE DIMENSION OF PRECISE ENGINEERING THAT SENHANCE HAS DOWN PAT, FOR OVER 4 YEARS THEIR 3MM HAS PROVEN ITSELF.

[Expected Moves this Week: GDP, Fed Minutes. Earnings From Nvidia, Walmart, Carvana, Coinbase more.,;,; ## Market View  **Last Week ‚Äì SPY holding a tight range for Feb, so far.**  SPY traded in about a 2.5% range and finished more or less unchanged on the week. That was versus options that were pricing about a 2.2% move for the week. In fact, the SPX has traded in a fairly tight 3% range for February so far. That‚Äôs despite a slew of important economic releases and volatile earnings announcements that could have been market-moving. Implied volatility remains on the lower end of the option premium prices we‚Äôve seen over the past year. The VIX got as low as 18 following the CPI release but closed the week back above 21. The market saw a bounce on Friday that kept it from falling below that February range, a move that would have seen IV spike a bit.  **This Week ‚Äì Downside level of February range one to watch for IV.**  SPY options are pricing about a 1.5% move for the holiday-shortened week. The $404.50 level that SPY tested on Friday is one to watch as moves lower than that low end of the recent range could see put protection buying and higher IV. The FOMC minutes on Wednesday and the GDP print on Thursday are ones to watch on the economic calendar. Nvidia, Walmart, Coinbase, Carvana and Block highlight the earnings calendar.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/y2je7fjevdja1.png?width=1291&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de9f1a12d71573e94fd4c39c843eaadf025a8dc1  **Expected Moves for This Week**¬†([via Options AI free tools](https://tools.optionsai.com/))  * SPY¬†**1.5%** * QQQ **2.0%**¬† * IWM¬†**1.8%**  * DIA¬†**1.3%**   **Economic Calendar**  * Tuesday ‚Äì **S&amp;P Global PMI** * Wednesday ‚Äì **FOMC minutes** * Thursday ‚Äì **GDP, Initial Jobless Claims** * Friday ‚Äì **Consumer Sentiment, Fed Speech (Jefferson)**  **High Options Volume Friday** ‚Äì OPEN, LOW, BB, MO, BSX, NRG, CSX, KSS, WMT, IEF, EWG  &amp;#x200B;  ## Earnings This Week  Via the [Options AI Earnings Calendar](https://tools.optionsai.com/). Expected move, weekly IV, and prior earnings moves (starting with most recent).  As mentioned in recent weeks, although the overall market IV is on the low end of what we‚Äôve seen the past year, there are some large idiosyncratic moves happening in single stock names. particularly stocks that saw large declines in 2022, as the potential for large percentage moves from a low stock price can sometimes be difficult for options to price. Carvana is a good example below, it‚Äôs seen moves of 40% in its last two earnings, with options trying to price the possibility of a move like that, or the chance of it not moving at all, and seemingly splitting the difference with an expected move of around 24%. The stock is just $11 now and has seen a high of over $18 and a low near $10 this month alone. Massive percentage moves that are difficult for the options market to price as the straddles to account for the potential of a stock doubling would be nearly the entire stock price to zero on the downside.  &amp;#x200B;  **Tuesday**  * **Walmart** WMT /¬†**Expected Move:¬†4.0%**¬†/ Recent moves: +7%, +5%, -11% * **Home Depot** HD /¬†**Expected Move:¬†3.8%**¬†/ Recent moves: +2%, +4%, +2% * **Coinbase** COIN /¬†**Expected Move:¬†16.5%**¬†/ Recent moves: +5%, +7%, -26%, -2% * **Palo Alto Networks** PANW /¬†**Expected Move:¬†6.6%**¬†/ Recent moves: +7%, +12%, +10%, +1%  **Wednesday**  * **Baidu** BIDU /¬†**Expected Move:¬†6.4%**¬†/ Recent moves: +1%, -7%, +14, +7% * **Nvidia** NVDA /¬†**Expected Move:¬†6.9%**¬†/ Recent moves: -1%, +4%, +5% * **Lucid** LCID /¬†**Expected Move:¬†14.6%**¬†/ Recent moves: -3%, +4%, -7%, +10% * **Etsy** ETSY /¬†**Expected Move:¬†9.6%**¬†/ Recent moves: +14%, +10%, -17%, +16%  **Thursday**  * **Block** SQ /¬†**Expected Move:¬†9.2%**¬†/ Recent moves: +12%, -2%, +1%, +26% * **Alibaba** BABA /¬†**Expected Move:¬†5.7%**¬†/ Recent moves: +8%, +2%, +15%, -1% * **Carvana** CVNA /¬†**Expected Move:¬†23.5%**¬†/ Recent moves: -39%, +40%, -10%, +21% * **Domino‚Äôs Pizza** DPZ /¬†**Expected Move: 6.5%**¬†/ Recent moves: +11%, -1%, -5%, 0% * **Mercado Libre** MELI /¬†**Expected Move: 7.1%**¬†/ Recent moves: +8%, +16%, +2%, +4% * **Moderna** MRNA /¬†**Expected Move: 6.6%**¬†/ Recent moves: -1%, +16%, +6%, +15%,;,; 2023-02-20 18:06:15]
[Expected moves, Core PCE, SPY, QQQ,;,; Futures are higher this morning. The market still has to digest the Fed's preferred inflation measure of core PCE which drops before the open. It's been a positive week for SPY, up about 1.1% coming into this morning (not counting the futures being higher). That's about in line with the move options were pricing for the week, so a positive day today would take stocks beyond what options had priced. That slow grind in a low-vol environment can be frustrating for option sellers as upside calls are really cheap and really close to the money when a trade is entered... so trade management on a slow creep higher is important. Option vol remains low and may get lower into the close preceding what is a quasi 3-and-a-half day weekend that market makers will not want to be owning a ton of premium into.  **Today's (0DTE) expected moves:**  * SPY: 0.5% * QQQ: 0.7%  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market:**  * Renalytix Ai Plc ADR (RNLX) +41.06% * Genfit S.A.

[Expected moves: VIX pickup, SPY, QQQ Grind lower. Rare Friday Earns from Palo Alto,;,; Stocks are lower again to start Friday. It's been a rough week overall, with the SPY down about 2.5% or so. That's more than double the move options were pricing, and the moves have been a bit more than 0DTE options have been pricing each day. Near-term options are waking up a bit, with 0DTE pricing in expected moves for SPY now out at about 0.7% or so each day, that's up from just 0.4% a few weeks ago. The VIX is now near 19 meaning 30-day vol is back to about its historical average. One interesting data point to add to this is that the SPY itself has not been THAT volatile. It's off a bit more than 5% from its highs, and the recent selling has been a grind lower, not much panic selling. That's not just a *vibe*, the realized vol in SPY for the past 30 days is still just 10. That will likely begin to increase a bit with the past week seeing moves in excess of what options were pricing, but again, the selling has been orderly in the major indices thus far.  Nothing on the economic data front today but next week is the Jackson Hole Conference which takes on some additional significance after this week's more hawkish than expected FOMC minutes as well as what's going on in China's markets.  A rare after-hours on Friday earnings report today from Palo Alto Networks. That may have some traders spooked a bit as it does feel like a Friday news dump (where you'd try to bury bad news when everyone is already away from their desks). However, the last SP 500 company to do the same was Nike in 2020 and that report was good. So who knows. Here's how options are trying to price the event, an odd one as you have to go out to next Friday's options, not today's, to trade options that capture the event:  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/54a32hdvevib1.png?width=823&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5971ace74cf257bca6c1e2c9d0c4d9f6196a213  The 8% move matches that prior reports actual move of +8%.

[Expected moves: Netflix, Tesla and more.,;,; The second round of big bank earnings are out with Bank of America, PNC and Morgan Stanley reporting this morning. The results have not been market-moving as of yet. MS is unched as of now, with BAC down slightly, both with moves less than options were pricing. PNC is down about 3% vs a 3.5% expected move. So the reactions are pretty muted all things considered. The broader market thinks the same, with futures all red but very slightly. Most of the bank stocks were lower over the past 3 months with the exception of JPM. JPM has also performed the best from the bank stocks that reported last week, initially giving up its earnings move gains but recovering much of them with a strong up day yesterday. Goldman reports tomorrow and then the focus shifts quickly to mega-cap tech after the bell tomorrow with Netflix and Tesla kicking things off.

[Expected moves: A little life in market vol, SPY QQQ VIX Netflix and more,;,; Stock futures are lower for the second straight day. It's a big two days for economic data, following yesterday's Fed minutes. This morning, ADP reported \~500k private sector jobs added, doubling expectations. That sent futures lower as it's yet another sign the FOMC is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer and potentially be more aggressive with raises. The US 2-year treasury yield is above 5% near this year's high, but more importantly, nearing levels it hasn't seen since 2006. Stocks have absorbed higher interest rate assumptions over the past 2 months quite well, rising with the rising yields. That played out mainly due to lessening fears of a recession (and the AI hype driving tech stocks higher). If the jobs number comes in hot tomorrow it will be just the latest data point pointing to a persistently strong economy, driving yields higher, and assumptions of a more hawkish Fed for the balance of 2023. There are signs elsewhere in the economic data of an economy that's cooling off in certain sectors, but jobs and hiring has remained strong, and we'll find out more on the front tomorrow. This 2-day pullback in stocks is breathing a little life into option vol. The VIX is now \~15.30, up from 13 just a few trading days ago.   As was mentioned in this space, vol got about as low as you'd ever see over the past two weeks. That didn't mean it would immediately go higher, but it was unlikely to go much lower. A 15.30 VIX is still historically low but it does show a little appetite for traders to buy options. Something we haven't seen much of over the past several weeks. Skew is near the highest levels of the past few years, meaning downside put strikes were already more expensive than upside call strikes. That is largely reflective of a low IV environment where the percentage differences get magnified, but keep an eye on that skew number as the VIX rises, if it remains high, it would be showing continued demand for puts even at higher vol, and therefore be a good indication of any fear in the market.   With earnings season approaching, it's also interesting to look at how low individual stock IV got and how it's pricing upcoming earnings. Netflix, which reports on the 19th, has 55 IV at the moment for the event, pricing in about an 8% move (that includes all the time leading up to the event as well.) For perspective, in Netflix's last 6 earnings, the stock has moved less than 8% just twice and has had +/-7% moves 5 out of 6 times. In other words, vol is low in most individual stocks as compared o the past 2 years, and with earnings right around the corner, you'll see much smaller expected moves on average (as of now).  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Movers:**     * Tesla Inc (TSLA) -0.44% * Allarity Therapeutics Inc (ALLR) -51.57% * Bioxcel Therapeutics Inc (BTAI) +23.73% * Genius Sports Ltd (GENI) +9.12% * Meta Platforms Inc (META) +1.70% * Lucid Group Inc (LCID) -1.48% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +0.29% * Riot Platforms Inc (RIOT) +3.24% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.16% * Affirm Holdings Inc Cl A (AFRM) -5.06% * Perion Network Ltd (PERI) +7.22%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**     * Levi Strauss &amp; Co.

[Highest Earnings Volatility for the Week of November 20, 2023,;,; ,;,; 2023-11-17 15:04:39]
[Expected Moves: Low IV Trading and Earnings from Netflix, Tesla, Goldman, IBM and more.,;,; ## Market View  **Last Week ‚Äì Closing with a VIX Level we haven‚Äôt seen in years**  SPY finished higher by about 0.8% last week, another fairly quiet move inside what options were pricing (+/- 1.6%). The VIX was lower on the week and its closing low Friday near 17 is its lowest level since the late 2021all time market highs. The range on the week was also inside the expected move, with less than a 1.5% difference between the intra-week highs and lows. In other words, IV is low, but realized moves for the past few weeks have been even less.  **This Week ‚Äì Earnings heat up as IV cools**  SPY options are pricing just a 1.1% move for the upcoming week. That‚Äôs as low a move as we‚Äôve seen in quite some time, a factor traders need to be aware of into what could be some idiosyncratic moves in individual stocks as they begin to report. A good example came Friday as several of the large banks reported. The banking system has obviously been a focus for traders the past month, and banks giving insight in that environment would typically come in high vol environment. But because the market had stabilized since the regional bank chaos, the big banks that reported on Friday actually reported in a low IV environment. The result was two of the banks, PNC and Wells Fargo barely moving, well inside their expected moves, while the two that did see moves (JPM and Citi) nearly doubled their expected moves to the upside.  A general rule of thumb on expected moves into earnings is that a stock will stay at or inside its expected move roughly 70% of the time. But the IV backdrop does factor into those numbers. When IV is historically high, it is more likely that a stock stays within its expected move, with the moves outside expectations sometimes massive, but occurring less often. However, when the IV backdrop is low, moves outside expectations tend to happen more often, but the outsized moves themselves tend to be less massive. This makes sense intuitively. Had JPM reported in the middle of the banking turmoil of last month, and shown a net inflow of deposits from regional banks, while its IV, and the market‚Äôs overall IV had been alot higher, its move may have been even more. And that‚Äôs not just due to sentiment, although that‚Äôs a big factor, but it also has to do with the amount of short gamma that is in the market at high IV levels. High IV can create air pockets for stocks to move through. Whereas lower IV backdrops can create a long gamma backdrop, acting as a governor on moves.  The TL:DR version of that is that moves in low-vol environments are smaller overall, with less short gamma in the market. But because the expected move is so much smaller as well, moves outside expectations happen more often. The 4 banks that reported Friday are a small sample size, but the fact that two barely moved, and the other two doubled their expected move on a move that would have been considered normal just a few weeks ago, is a good illustration.  So what does that mean for trade strategies? Credit spreads create really tight windows for a stock to stay within, and it will often be self-fulfilling. The fact that the SPY‚Äôs last two weeks saw moves of just 0.4% and 0.8% is indicative of that. However, when a stock does violate that expected move, it won‚Äôt take much, and is likely to happen slightly more often. Credit Spreads should be defined risk because the premium received is not enough to make up for the fact that a % move of a couple percent could be a 4x loss. And debit spreads could look to take advantage of that as well. For instance, the likelihood of a massive move on earnings of 20% in a low IV/long gamma environment of a stock expecting a 5% move is very unlikely, however, that stock moving 6-7%, slightly beyond the expected move will happen more often. And because of that, a debit spread at the expected move could see a 3-4x return when that stock goes beyond expectations.  E.G., a stock trading $100 with a 5% expected move, the trader looking to sell premium should be very careful to define risk narrowly, perhaps a dollar wide at or beyond the expected move, so that a move to $92 or $108 (beyond the tight $95 to $105 expected move) doesn‚Äôt cause outsized losses. And on the flipside, there can be an opportunity for a long premium trader looking for a move beyond $95 or $105, with say a 105/106 call spread or a 95/94 put spread, rather than a lotto ticket call or put. The chances that the stock will make a massive move is less likely, but the chance it will move slightly beyond the move, is a slightly more frequent occurrence in low IV.  *Note, although a 17 VIX is the lowest level for the past few years, it isn‚Äôt super low historically and could just be a blip before it goes higher, or it could go much lower (mid to low teens is historically low). However, it is now lower than the historical mean, something we haven‚Äôt seen much of in recent years*.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/adnfymvpkaua1.png?width=1157&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdd4805f4f5ef9322410f18ed9dde057fca1d8db  &amp;#x200B;  **Expected Moves for This Week**¬†([via Options AI](https://tools.optionsai.com/))  * SPY¬†**1.1%** * QQQ **1.6%**¬† * IWM¬†**1.7%**  * DIA¬†**1.1%**   **Economic Calendar**  * Tuesday ‚Äì **Housing starts, Fed Speech (Bowman)** * Thursday ‚Äì **Initial jobless claims, Philly Manufacturing**  **Unusual Option Volume Thursday**  * BA, HON, NVDA, BUD, META, NFLX, SCHW  ##   ## Earnings This Week  Via the [Options AI Earnings Calendar](https://tools.optionsai.com/earnings-calendar) (free to use) showing expected moves as currently priced and past moves for comparison.  ***Monday***  * **Charles Schwab SCHW ‚Äì Expected Move: 8%** \[Prior\] -3% -2% -2  ***Tuesday***  * **Bank of America BAC ‚Äì** Expected Move: 4.3% \[Prior\] +2% +6% 0% * **Goldman Sachs ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.4% \[Prior\] -6% +2% +3% * **Lockheed Martin LMT ‚Äì** Expected Move: 2.4% \[Prior\] +2% +9% +1 -2% * **Netflix NFLX** ‚Äì Expected Move: 7.4% \[Prior\] +8% +13% +7% -35% * **United Airlines UAL** ‚Äì Expected Move: 5.2% \[Prior\] -1% +5% +1% +1%  ***Wednesday***  * **Morgan Stanley MS ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.6% \[Prior\] +6% -5% 0% * **ASML Holding ASML ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.7% \[Prior\] +2% +6% +3% +3% * **Tesla TSLA ‚Äì** Expected Move: 7% \[Prior\] +11% -7% +10% +3% * **IBM IBM ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.7% \[Prior\] -5% +5% -5% +7%  ***Thursday***  * **Taiwan Semi TSM ‚Äì** Expected Move: 4.3% \[Prior\] +6% +4% +3% * **American Express AXP ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.7% \[Prior\] +10% -2% +2% -3%,;,; 2023-04-16 18:45:00]

Forgive me if this is a dumb question, but would it be a bad idea to open a strangle on,or before Wednesday, before Nvidia‚Äôs earnings report, obliviously it will make a big move wether that be up or down, as it‚Äôs the hottest stock on the market. I know that inherently options contracts are designed to make the people buying them lose there money, with that being said, there will be an IV crush Thursday, but if the stock price moves enough that shouldn‚Äôt effect options contracts to heavily right? I am guessing the stock price to move anywhere from 10-20 percent, I honestly expect nvidia to get crushed even if the earnings are good because a PE ratio of 95 percent is not sustainable in the long term, if they crush earnings I could see the stock going to 1,000+  What are your guys plans for Wednesday? How do you think the stock price will move? If I decide to open a strangle should I open one Tuesday or Wednesday or does it not matter either way? I‚Äôll keep you guys updated if I go through with the trade. I‚Äôve also noticed on the charts Nvidia is starting to trade sideways, is this a sign of a pullback before continuing up?

However, the preceding quarters experienced more varied results, including modest growth, a decline, and a significant drop in sales.  These fluctuations in sales growth suggest that NVIDIA‚Äôs revenue stream may not be consistently expanding. Such volatility can impact the company‚Äôs overall valuation, especially when combined with the high P/E ratio of 219.84 mentioned earlier. Investors should be cautious when evaluating the stock‚Äôs current valuation, considering the mixed performance shown in the income statement.  	1.	Market Capitalization: NVIDIA‚Äôs market cap stands at a staggering $1.04 trillion, highlighting its prominence in the market. However, a high market cap alone does not guarantee that a stock is fairly valued. 	2.	Earnings Per Share (EPS): NVIDIA‚Äôs EPS for the most recent fiscal year was reported at $1.92. While this figure appears solid, a deeper analysis is necessary to assess its significance in relation to the stock‚Äôs valuation. 	3.	Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: The P/E ratio for NVIDIA is an eye-opening 219.84, indicating a substantial premium investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. A high P/E ratio could suggest overvaluation if not adequately supported by other factors.  To assess NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation further, it is prudent to compare the company‚Äôs financial indicators to those of its competitors within the semiconductor sector, namely AMD, Micron, and AVGO.  AMD, with an EPS of 0.24 and a market capitalization of $183.44 billion, exhibits a notably lower valuation compared to NVIDIA. However, the semiconductor industry‚Äôs current fame and widespread recognition may contribute to inflated valuations across the sector.  Micron‚Äôs negative EPS of -2.68 and market capitalization of $69.12 billion indicate weaker financial performance when compared to NVIDIA and AMD. As a result, Micron may not serve as an accurate benchmark for evaluating NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation.  AVGO, another prominent player in the semiconductor sector, boasts a healthy EPS of 31.64 and a P/E ratio of 27.41. With a market capitalization of $357.98 billion, AVGO appears to be favorably valued relative to its earnings, further highlighting the need for careful evaluation within the semiconductor sector.  Comparing AVGO‚Äôs Annual Income Statement with NVDA‚Äôs provides valuable insights into the financial performance of both companies:  AVGO Annual Income Statement:  	‚Ä¢	2022 Sales/Revenue: $33,203 million 	‚Ä¢	2022 Net Income: $11,495 million  NVDA Annual Income Statement:  	‚Ä¢	2023 Sales/Revenue: $26,974 million 	‚Ä¢	2023 Net Income: $4,368 million  Looking at the revenue figures, AVGO has consistently shown higher sales/revenue over the past five years. In 2022, AVGO reported sales of $33,203 million, while NVDA reported sales of $26,974 million.  In terms of net income, AVGO has also demonstrated strong performance. In 2022, AVGO reported a net income of $11,495 million, indicating robust profitability. On the other hand, NVDA reported a net income of $4,368 million in 2023, which is notably lower than AVGO‚Äôs net income.  These figures suggest that AVGO has consistently outperformed NVDA in terms of both revenue and net income. The higher revenue and stronger profitability of AVGO further reinforce the argument that NVIDIA may be overvalued when compared to AVGO.  Taking into account the prevailing economic challenges and the potential impact on the semiconductor sector, there are indications that NVIDIA‚Äôs current valuation may be inflated. The semiconductor industry, including NVIDIA, has gained significant attention due to its critical role in emerging technologies and the ongoing digital revolution. However, widespread recognition and market enthusiasm can contribute to elevated valuations.  Given the factors discussed above, including the mixed sales growth, high P/E ratio, and comparisons to industry peers, there is a compelling case to suggest that NVIDIA‚Äôs stock may experience a sharp price decline in the near future. The current economic environment, with signs of a slowdown in overall economic activity and uncertainties surrounding inflation and interest rates, adds further weight to this analysis.  While the company‚Äôs prominence in the semiconductor industry is undeniable, the potential for overvaluation cannot be overlooked. The market cap of $1.04 trillion alone does not guarantee fair valuation, and the EPS and P/E ratio indicate a premium investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.  While the stock has enjoyed significant attention and growth, there are indications that it is overvalued. In conclusion, it is crucial for investors to assess NVIDIA‚Äôs stock valuation critically, taking into account the economic landscape, company fundamentals, and industry trends.,;,; 2023-07-02 15:37:57]

[Nvidia $NVDA rises, here is why -,;,; Nvidia $NVDA intends to announce three new chips for China, weeks after the company was restricted by the U.S. from selling two high-end artificial intelligence chips and another top gaming chip to Chinese companies, Reuters reported citing local news outlet STAR Market Daily. Nvidia (NVDA) stock has risen about 2% at market open.  The chips are known as HGX H20, L20 PCIe and L2 PCIe and that the U.S. tech giant could announce them on Nov. 16 at the earliest, the media outlet said citing people with knowledge of the matter.  In October, the U.S. brought in new updates to its export restrictions which curbed the sale of chips that Nvidia (NVDA) made for the Chinese market, such as the A800 and H800 chips, as part of Washington's efforts aimed at hindering China's access to advanced semiconductor technology. Last year, the U.S. imposed rules restricting Nvidia from selling its A100 and H100 chips to China, after which the company had come up with A800 and H800 chips as alternatives for the Chinese market.

[Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA‚Äôs Price Target? Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, Leading Them to Encourage Others to Buy for their own profits?,;,; NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock‚Äôs potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind. Should the stock underperform, it will be a litmus test of these analysts‚Äô sincerity, raising questions about whether they may be manipulating public sentiment.  In the broader context of the semiconductor sector, the recent quarterly earnings have been largely underwhelming. Yet, all semiconductor stocks appear to be buoyed by NVIDIA‚Äôs momentum. A stumble in NVIDIA‚Äôs stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks. My intuition, however, leans towards a potential disappointment. NVIDIA might surpass current estimates but simultaneously lower their future guidance due to sluggish growth. Should this occur, a significant drop in stock price could follow.  Disclaimer: These thoughts are purely my own observations and should not be taken as financial advice.,;,; 2023-08-17 04:33:15]

[Nvidia reports earnings, Fed gathers in Jackson Hole: What about this week:,;,; In the final week of August, investors will be focused on two major events: Nvidia's earnings and the Federal Reserve's annual meeting in Jackson Hole. The Jackson Hole Economic Symposium will kick off on Thursday, with Fed Chair Jay Powell's address serving as the major event. Powell's comments on interest rates, the economy, and any indication that inflationary pressures are driving a reassessment of the Fed's present aims will be scrutinized. On the corporate front, Nvidia headlines the earnings story this week, with the chipmaker scheduled to publish data from a quarter that caused the chipmaker to increase its revenue forecast by 50%. Lowe's, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Peloton are also set to announce earnings this week.   August is shaping up to be the worst month for stocks this year, with all three main averages closing last week lower after a hawkish read of the minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting sent equities lower and Treasury rates higher in the second half of the week. Economic data continues to come in stronger than expected, with the July retail sales report indicating a 0.7% increase in sales for the month, about double what economists forecast. The AtlantaFed's GDPNow projection now predicts third-quarter GDP growth of 5.8%, the strongest rate since the fourth quarter of 2021.  Inflation has declined dramatically since Powell's Jackson Hole speech last year, when he predicted rates will climb until the "job is done," lowering inflation. Powell has stated as recently as July that inflation is "well above" the Fed's long-run objective of 2%. On the corporate front, all eyes will be on Nvidia, which predicted that artificial intelligence demand will increase its current quarter sales projection from $7 billion to $11 billion. Nvidia stock is up about 200% year to date, but its gains have slowed along with the market since mid-July. Nvidia's earnings release in late May signaled a shift in overall market mood for the year, with Wall Street strategists becoming more overtly bullish on stock market performance in 2023. ,;,; 2023-08-21 11:34:49]
[NVIDIA's place in the AI Race,;,;  Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) is anticipated to be one of the primary beneficiaries of the current artificial intelligence boom in the tech industry, which has resulted in a significant increase in investments. The company's focused efforts on AI technology has positioned it as a prominent supplier for tech firms seeking AI solutions, making it a top contender in the chipmaking industry.       Bank of America Corp. said Nvidia is at the forefront of the companies that stand to benefit from growth in so-called generative AI. Wells Fargo &amp; Co. said upcoming chips from Nvidia are well positioned to take advantage of greater computing needs required by AI models like ChatGPT.   https://preview.redd.it/ixqbvm6wp0ka1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ddb94765d683a97016219df411e7228c0c794294,;,; 2023-02-23 22:56:37]
[China‚Äôs Export Curbs Pose Grave Threat to Nvidia‚Äôs $1 Trillion Market Cap, Sending Shockwaves Through the Global Tech Industry,;,; China is the world‚Äôs leading producer of gallium and germanium, making any reduction in its output a significant concern for the global tech industry. The limited availability of these metals is likely to slow down production or result in increased prices for manufacturers and their clients in the technology, telecommunications, energy, and automotive sectors. As gallium and germanium are alternatives to traditional silicon wafers in specialized applications, their scarcity could disrupt the supply chain, impacting the production capabilities of companies reliant on these materials.  Gallium and germanium are among dozens of minerals classified by the US government as critical to economic and national security. The US state department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  According to officials and experts in China, Beijing is expected to introduce further retaliatory measures in response to the expansion of US-led controls on technology exports.  ‚ÄúThere will be more retaliatory measures against the snowballing semiconductor export controls from western countries,‚Äù said one senior official close to the Chinese commerce ministry.  Considering Nvidia is expected to hit 11B+ in revenue for the next quarter, going from 7billion to 11billion considering their already complicated supply chain issues and this is only going to worsen the issue and make it harder for them to meet that expectation.   Nvidia is now ‚Äúpriced for perfection.‚Äù The bears can point to pretty much any risk and have a valid point. as a dominant player in the semiconductor industry, Nvidia is far from immune to the potential consequences of China‚Äôs export curbs. The company‚Äôs market cap of $1 trillion is largely based on its leadership in AI Chips. Nvidia could face significant challenges in maintaining its market dominance and growth trajectory.  The restrictions could impede the company‚Äôs access to critical components and hinder its ability to supply AI chips to the Chinese market, which is a major consumer of these technologies. Such restrictions would not only impact Nvidia‚Äôs revenue but also create an opportunity for competitors to gain market share in China and beyond.  Kim Yang-paeng, a researcher at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade, said the restrictions were ‚Äúworrisome‚Äù for South Korean chipmakers.  ‚ÄúKorean companies can find alternative sources, but it will take some time‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâif you lack some materials, no matter how important they are, this could hit chip production,‚Äù he said.  Based on historical precedents, supply chain disruptions and export curbs have often resulted in market volatility and reduced investor confidence. If Nvidia faces difficulties in sourcing essential materials and encounters restrictions on selling AI chips to China, it could face a decline in market capitalization. The loss of Chinese customers alone, given their significant demand for AI chips, could have a substantial impact on Nvidia‚Äôs revenue and market value. Additionally, heightened geopolitical tensions may deter investors and hinder Nvidia‚Äôs expansion plans, further eroding its market cap.  China‚Äôs export curbs on gallium and germanium, along with the potential limitations on AI chip exports, pose a serious threat to Nvidia‚Äôs ability to maintain its $1 trillion market cap. The disruption to the global supply chain, which was just starting to recover. The tech sector in particular, and the uncertainty surrounding future market dynamics could undermine Nvidia‚Äôs growth and market dominance.  The recent move by China to impose export restrictions on gallium and germanium, essential metals used in chipmaking and communications equipment, has intensified the geopolitical tensions between China and the United States. These measures, aimed at safeguarding national security and interests, signify a retaliatory response to the semiconductor restrictions imposed by the US. While China‚Äôs actions may have short-term implications for Chinese manufacturers, the long-term consequences will undermine Nvidia‚Äôs ability to maintain its $1 trillion market cap.

[Nvidia Surpasses Berkshire By Market Value In the Decisive Moment of AI Era,;,; Just two days ago, Nvidia dropped a bomb on the AI industry, igniting an already-hot field. Meanwhile, the Fed just signaled the end of a rate-hiking cycle. Together, these factors propelled Nvidia's market value beyond that of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, cementing its position as the fifth-largest publicly traded company in the United States.  Overnight, Nvidia's stock rose 2.73% to $271.9, increasing its market value to $671.6 billion. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway's A-class shares fell 0.64%, decreasing its market value to $659.1 billion, allowing Nvidia to surpass it in market value.   Just five months ago, it would have been a laughing matter if someone had suggested that Nvidia would surpass Berkshire Hathaway in market value. However, market sentiment has changed, the rise of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence technologies has provided strong support for Nvidia. With the development of AI technology, the demand for computing power is increasing. Nvidia's one-stop-shop approach of providing both hardware and software ecosystem puts it in a leading position globally.  As a result, Nvidia's stock price has risen nearly 90% since the beginning of the year, and its increase is even higher at 136% if calculated from its low point in October last year. In comparison, Berkshire's stock price has fallen 3.4% and risen 13.4% during these two periods.  If the AI boom continues, it seems that there will be no stopping the rise in Nvidia's stock price. However, some experts point out that while Nvidia has excelled in the AI race, its high valuation could be a concern. Currently, its expected P/E ratio is over 60, a level it has only reached once in the past 10 years. This has left analysts who are both bullish on Nvidia's prospects and well-versed in the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market in a bit of a bind.  Analysts believe that Nvidia's business related to AIGC is almost entirely dependent on capital expenditures from global tech giants, especially Microsoft and Google. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri predicted in a report last week that AIGC could bring an additional $10-15 billion in GPU demand over the next one to two years.  Based on this, analysts currently predict that Nvidia's annual revenue will exceed $46 billion in three years, with an average annual growth rate of 20% - an astonishing rate for a chip manufacturer of Nvidia's size. However, tech giants' capital expenditures in the data center space are not evenly distributed, as evidenced by disappointing results in cloud services from companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google in their earnings reports for the quarter ended December last year, with warnings that growth rates will further slow down in the current quarter.  In addition, Nvidia may face increasingly fierce competition from AMD, which is launching its own data center GPU chips.  Last week, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore upgraded Nvidia's rating to a buy, even though he also pointed out that its valuation had risen to extremely high levels. He said that the development of AIGC is too big of a trend to be disrupted by tactical concerns; while it may be difficult to bet on Nvidia's stock at its current level, shorting the company also seems unwise.

[Nvidia CTO: Cryptocurrency has little value, AI is the future!,;,; Cryptocurrency mining demand has driven [Nvidia](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-NVDA/)'s GPU chip sales. However, Michael Kagan, [Nvidia](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-NVDA/)'s chief technology officer, sent a different signal in a recent interview.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/kli5k7pqvgqa1.png?width=691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef84a896b284e8ae9877d22e51b71864107cc52a  Kagan points out that cryptocurrency miners buy a lot of [Nvidia](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-NVDA/) hardware, but cryptocurrencies don't add anything useful to society, which is why the crypto market has crashed so often recently.  By contrast, he prefers AI (artificial intelligence) because it is good for society. Artificial intelligence allows individuals to create custom programs to meet different needs. But the high-frequency trading of cryptocurrencies doesn't actually mean anything to humans.  He therefore suggests that the same processor chips used to mine cryptocurrencies be used to create chatbots, such as ChatGPT, that add more value to society.  **Cryptocurrency mania fades**  GPUs are a great tool for cryptocurrency mining. During the crypto boom of 2020 and 2021, "miners" snapped up Nvidia GPUs in a frenzy. The price of GPUs had been on an upward trend due to higher demand.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/t0bdrinrvgqa1.png?width=436&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4310de12521b68afba0a64df3490bb0b491eadc0  That has also helped drive solid growth in Nvidia's GPU business. But that didn't last long. With cryptocurrency prices plummeting at a rapid rate, miners' profits were falling, and Nvidia's GPU business slowed.  According to Jon Peddie Research, Nvidia, Intel and AMD shipped 6.9 million individual GPUs in the third quarter of 2022, down 42% from the same period in 2021 and the lowest number of units shipped since the report began.  Nvidia, meanwhile, reported a 17% year-over-year drop in revenue and a 72% year-over-year drop in net income in the third quarter, with gaming graphics and visualization revenues down more than 50%. By Nvidia's own account, declining GPU sales are a big part of the reason.  **AI takes over**  Kagan points out that the failure of cryptocurrencies is not surprising. He pointed out that, apart from speculation, the crypto industry doesn't have any real-world examples.  Not so with artificial intelligence. He points out that since ChatGPT was released, AI has been front and center, and more and more application scenarios have been developed.  [Nvidia](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-NVDA/) CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is also betting big on AI. He said the emergence of new chatbots such as ChatGPT was an "iPhone moment" in artificial intelligence. He expects artificial intelligence to flourish and lead Nvidia to high sales and high growth again.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/dxuzwycsvgqa1.png?width=692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=543dacd7a977a1429719d7076cd91f8eead7294c  [Nvidia](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-NVDA/) has indeed made a foray into AI, recently unveiling a cloud-based AI supercomputer that users can access through a desktop browser.

[Best Stocks for Long-Term Investment Discussion (2023),;,; THIS IS NOT A FINANCIAL ADVICE. You do not search for proper financial advice on Reddit. And also, I am a dumbass. Feel free to correct me in the comments if I get things wrong.  I've been wondering about the best stocks to invest on for long-term.  IMO, a stock is great for investment if it can grow at a certain percentage. What I mean by this is that, the numbers are not important compared to the percentages. For example, Company A, worth $100B, increasing in value to $300B is better than company B, worth $2T, increasing in value to 2.6T, even though Company B earns more.  Here are stocks that I think are great for long-term investment (by the way, I think all this myself. I did not copy-paste this):  1. Nvidia  I think Nvidia is going to be very big in 2030. With AI increasing in popularity, Nvidia might be the biggest AI processor provider in 2030. Combined with its current not-that-high worth of around $600B, Nvidia might actually reach $10T in 2030, and anyone investing before the boom might feel the stonks.  2. TSMC  The most advanced semiconductor provider in the world, TSMC might be the one that will supply the cloth for Nvidia's pants, if that makes sense. It is basically a monopoly at this point. The most advanced AI processing companies might buy their wafer from this one company. Its current worth is also not that high, around $400B.  What I don't think are great for investment:  1. Google/Alphabet  Google's AI is great and all, but YouTube, man. YouTube is such a mess for Google. YouTube really inhibits them from increasing in value. They probably operate YouTube at a loss, and I can't blame them. They have to prepare datacenters to store thousands of 10-hour black screen videos uploaded at 4K 60FPS.  2. Tesla  I, as someone who's not a Westerner, do not know what Tesla's appeal. Are electric cars that profitable? And their AI is, like, weird. Unless they come out to be the first company to sell, like, a fully-functional humanoid AI robot, I am not sure if Tesla can really be great for investment. I can be REALLY wrong here, so let me know if I am and why.  And lastly, let me know other companies that you think are great for long-term investment.,;,; 2023-04-29 09:34:58]

[Intel Corporation: INTC‚Äôs Latest Strides and Challenges,;,;    https://preview.redd.it/lsj2qlkbgg6c1.png?width=1661&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a688b9c7db9f431a4ae4de2a9ad2e29900096f8  ### Key Takeaways:  * Innovation and expansion in new tech frontiers are key growth drivers. * Long-term outlook hinges on successful execution of strategic initiatives. * Intel unveils new AI chip to compete with Nvidia and AMD * Intel‚Äôs total revenue in Q3 2023 was $14.2 billion, marking an 8% decrease from Q3 2022.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/zo5lvnvdgg6c1.png?width=1771&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3df9475ca75c6dc09486a3955dcedf1d04e359e6  ### Company Overview:  Intel Corporation, a global technology leader, has been at the forefront of innovation in the semiconductor industry. Founded in 1968, Intel‚Äôs contributions have been pivotal in the evolution of computing technologies. The company specializes in manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, embedded processors, and network interface controllers, among others.  ### Intel‚Äôs Strategic Pivot Amidst Market Flux  Recent times have been a mix of challenges and opportunities for Intel. The company, once the undisputed leader in semiconductor technology, faces fierce competition from rivals like AMD and NVIDIA, who have made significant inroads into Intel‚Äôs market share. The rise of ARM-based processors and the increasing demand for specialized chips for AI and data centers add to the competitive pressure.  Intel‚Äôs response to these challenges has been multi-pronged. The company has accelerated its innovation cycle, focusing on next-generation chip technologies. Under the leadership of CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel announced a significant investment in expanding its manufacturing capabilities, aiming to not only meet its own chip demands but also offer foundry services to other chipmakers.  Moreover, Intel is actively diversifying its product portfolio. Its recent advancements in AI, edge computing, and autonomous driving technologies signify a strategic shift.¬†  Leading AI models, such as OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, predominantly utilize Nvidia GPUs hosted in cloud environments. This reliance has contributed to Nvidia‚Äôs stock soaring by approximately 230% since the beginning of the year, in stark contrast to Intel‚Äôs 68% increase. This trend underlines why competitors like AMD and Intel are now introducing their own chips, aiming to challenge Nvidia‚Äôs strong market presence.  Although specifics were sparse, Intel‚Äôs Gaudi3 is set to rival Nvidia‚Äôs H100, a popular choice for entities constructing extensive chip networks for AI operations, and AMD‚Äôs upcoming MI300X. The Gaudi3 is expected to begin distribution to clients in 2024.  However, these strategic decisions come with their own set of risks. The high cost of chip manufacturing and R&amp;D, coupled with the uncertain global economic landscape, poses significant challenges. The company‚Äôs ability to execute its ambitious plans while maintaining financial stability is a key factor to watch in the coming years.  ### Recent Financials:  Intel Corporation‚Äôs recent financial performance reflects the challenges and resilience of a tech giant in a volatile market. In Q3 2023, the company reported a total revenue of $14.2 billion, a decrease of 8% from the same quarter in the previous year. This decline was primarily due to decreases in revenue across its major segments: the Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue decreased by 3%, the Data Center and AI Group (DCAI) by 10%, and the Network and Edge Group (NEX) by a significant 32%.  The company‚Äôs financial strategy also reflects a commitment to operational efficiency and cost management. By streamlining processes and optimizing resources, Intel aims to improve its profitability and shareholder value in the long term. This approach is crucial as the company faces intense competition from other tech giants and emerging players in the semiconductor industry.  In conclusion, Intel‚Äôs recent financial performance, though marked by challenges, showcases the company‚Äôs strategic efforts to remain a dominant player in the tech industry. The company‚Äôs focus on innovation, operational efficiency, and market adaptability will be key to its future success and financial stability.  #### Financial Bullet Points:  * **Revenue (Q3 2023):** $14.2 billion, **down** 8% YoY. * **Client Computing Group Revenue:** **Decreased** by 3%. * **Data Center and AI Group Revenue:** **Decreased** by 10%. * **Network and Edge Group Revenue:** **Decreased** by 32%. * **Gross Margin (Q3 2023):** 42.5%, **slightly down** from 42.6% YoY. * **Net Income (Q3 2023):** $297 million, a **substantial decline** from $1.019 billion YoY. * **Earnings Per Share (Q3 2023):** $0.07, with non-GAAP EPS at $0.41.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/0yxuan2fgg6c1.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=528256a735b6b1088b9076cf8053d01466334e11  ### Business Model &amp; Competitors Analysis:  Intel‚Äôs business model revolves around its dominance in CPUs, with expansion into data center solutions, IoT, and AI. The company‚Äôs shift towards providing foundry services marks a strategic expansion of its business scope.  Competitors like AMD, NVIDIA, and ARM pose significant challenges. AMD‚Äôs gains in the CPU market and NVIDIA‚Äôs dominance in GPUs and AI chips have encroached on Intel‚Äôs turf. ARM‚Äôs energy-efficient architecture is increasingly favored for mobile devices and is making inroads into servers, a traditional Intel stronghold.  Intel‚Äôs response lies in its comprehensive product range, manufacturing capabilities, and R&amp;D investments. The company‚Äôs ability to innovate and adapt to market trends will be crucial in maintaining its competitive edge.  ### SWOT Analysis:  * **Strengths**: Strong brand, diverse product portfolio, manufacturing capabilities. * **Weaknesses**: Margin pressures, high competition, execution risks on strategic shifts. * **Opportunities**: Growth in AI, autonomous tech, and data centers. * **Threats**: Rapid technological changes, competitive market dynamics, global economic uncertainties.  ### Investment Outlook:  Intel‚Äôs future performance hinges on its ability to innovate and adapt to market trends. The company‚Äôs investment in AI and IoT, along with its strategic focus on foundry services, positions it well for future growth.  After conducting a comprehensive 10-year forecast, our analysis indicates that Intel‚Äôs current valuation appears to be justifiable, taking into account a range of scenarios. These scenarios are grounded in conservative (low), moderate (mid), and optimistic (high) financial assumptions, providing a robust framework for evaluating the company‚Äôs long-term potential.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/squ40h8ggg6c1.png?width=894&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f6f2904b5930e27085da77b8147e50c4b9335c0  #### Concluding Remarks:  In conclusion, Intel Corporation stands at a pivotal point. Its strategic pivots, financial resilience, and commitment to innovation are commendable. Yet, the road ahead is fraught with challenges and competition. Intel‚Äôs journey will be a testament to its adaptability and resilience in an ever-evolving tech landscape. For investors, keeping a keen eye on Intel‚Äôs execution of its ambitious plans will be crucial in assessing its long-term potential in the dynamic semiconductor industry.,;,; 2023-12-15 12:50:05]

[Ark Invest's Cathie Wood is betting big on AI with these 4 stocks‚Äîincluding one that could skyrocket 750%.,;,; Ark Invest‚Äôs Cathie Wood is known for investing in disruptive innovation. The super investor has placed big bets on artificial intelligence (AI), which is widely regarded as one of the most disruptive and transformative technologies today.  Speaking of AI stocks, it‚Äôs hard to ignore what **Nvidia Corp.** ($NVDA) has been doing. Shares of the chipmaking giant have surged 165% so far this year, and the company crossed $1 trillion in valuation at one point.  Ark Invest‚Äôs flagship fund **Ark Innovation ETF** ($ARKK) exited its position in Nvidia in January, but some of its other exchange-traded funds (ETFs) still have positions in the chipmaker.  In a recent interview with Bloomberg Television, Wood said that Nvidia ‚Äúwill do well over time.‚Äù But she sees a new group of stocks that will ‚Äúbenefit from the foundation that Nvidia has laid.‚Äù  The keyword is software.  ‚ÄúIn our view, for every dollar of hardware that Nvidia sells, software providers, SaaS \[software as a service\] providers will generate $8 in revenue,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo we are looking to the software providers who are actually right now where Nvidia was when we first bought it.‚Äù  The super investor then named three software companies she believes will thrive because of AI. Here‚Äôs a look at the trio and another company she calls ‚Äúthe biggest artificial intelligence play.‚Äù  ## UiPath Inc. ($PATH)  UiPath is a robotic process automation software company that provides automation solutions for businesses. Its AI-powered UiPath Business Automation Platform is capable of understanding, automating and operating end-to-end processes.  In the first quarter of 2023, the company‚Äôs revenue grew 18% year over year to $289.6 million. Notably, its dollar-based net retention rate was 122%.  The stock has surged 47% year to date, but it hasn‚Äôt always been a hot commodity: In 2022, UiPath shares plunged 70%.  Wood‚Äôs Ark Innovation ETF owns 28,865,375 shares of UiPath. With the position valued at $517.28 million, UiPath is the fourth-largest holding at Ark.  ## Twilio Inc. ($TWLO)  Twilio‚Äôs cloud communications platform allows businesses to develop and integrate various communication channels into their applications. Its application programming interfaces enable developers to incorporate voice, messaging and video seamlessly, helping companies enhance customer engagement.  In the first quarter, Twilio surpassed 300,000 active customer accounts. Meanwhile, revenue rose 15% year over year to $1.01 billion.  In its latest earnings conference call, Twilio Co-Founder and CEO Jeff Lawson said he believes that artificial intelligence ‚Äúwill be a material accelerant over time for Twilio‚Äôs business.‚Äù  Ark Innovation ETF holds 4,680,705 shares of Twilio, a stake with a market value of $303.54 million.  ## Teladoc Health Inc. ($TDOC)  Wood‚Äôs flagship fund also owns $301.07 million worth of telemedicine company Teladoc Health.  The company‚Äôs platform connects patients with healthcare professionals through video, phone and messaging.  At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, when in-person nonemergency medical care was temporarily halted, the demand for telehealth services skyrocketed.  In 2020, Teladoc attracted a lot of investor attention as its revenue shot up 98%.  While the pandemic is largely in the rearview mirror, the company continues to expand its business. Teladoc‚Äôs first-quarter revenue showed an 11% increase year over year.  The stock, however, wasn‚Äôt able to maintain the upward momentum. Trading at $24.30 per share, Teladoc is down more than 90% from its all-time high reached in February 2021.

Microsoft (7.84%)   2. Apple (6.83%)   3. Nvidia (3.8%)   4. Alphabet (3.72%)   5. Amazon (3.5%)   6. Meta (2.1%)   7. Berkshire Hathaway (1.71%)   8. Broadcom (1.28%)  Interesting to see the discrepancies and differences in the top eight from 2004 compared to the top eight from 2024. Not exactly surprising to see these giants at the top of the list.  The year is 2044... does the top eight look relatively similar to what it looks like now? Feels hard to argue otherwise. Then again they probably said similar things in 2004. It just seems like GAFAM will continue to purchase any successful companies of smaller size.

[Best-Performing Tech Stocks of Q1 2023 - $FSLY, $NVDA,;,; Tech stocks roared back to life in the first quarter of 2023, like a phoenix rising from the ashes. After being beaten down in recent months, tech stocks surged, thanks to better-than-expected earnings results, demand, cost-cutting strategies, and enthusiasm for artificial intelligence.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/gqisvqmqjasa1.png?width=468&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf6b451c6e168bef1b1185100c9a618db76845a8  Fastly stock rallied 116.8% thanks to investors‚Äô positive response to its cost-cutting efforts. Margins improved significantly in the fourth quarter, and management expects the company to move quickly toward profitability.  Nvidia, up 90.1%, was also a big winner. As investor interest in AI surged, shares of Nvidia ($NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) rallied. This was due in part to positive fourth-quarter earnings surprises from both companies. Nvidia and AMD are both major producers of graphics processing units (GPUs), which are critical components for powering AI workloads. AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT require thousands of GPUs to be trained.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/hfbll2esjasa1.png?width=341&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de2635a6745516fcadc13a029d87fe094ed1839e,;,; 2023-04-06 16:32:21]

[What would invest in if china invaded Taiwan tomorrow?,;,; I have studied china for quite some time as it's an important part of the global economy. Recently many woes has plagued china and with the coming us election this year might be finally the year china decided to invade Taiwan. Probably as mean to unite it's population and make them forget about the recent mismanagement from the CCP.  With this introduction out of the way how would you react and where would you invest?  I personally think that I would first invest into ASML.   Taiwan is the world main semiconductor foundry, even if the war is short damage to its fab is unavoidable. Meaning new fab will have to be made outside of Taiwan.  ASML is the only company in the world capable of replacing the 5-4-3nm capabilities found in Taiwan. Even if Europe or the USA lacks the Taiwanese technical skill they will still order the machine before finding out that they are not as skilled as the Taiwanese.  And secondly I would short LVMH and Hermes. As much I like the companies they make too much of their income in China.,;,; 2024-02-12 21:47:22]
[Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY?,;,; A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings:  https://preview.redd.it/evtbd2dnkgec1.png?width=654&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47c5c6d9f58e6997aad5330dba32ff543e2c8541  Data Sources:  * SPY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/spy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Schwab](https://www.schwab.wallst.com/schwab/Prospect/research/etfs/schwabETF/index.asp?type=holdings&amp;symbol=SPY)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/?guccounter=1)‚Äã‚Äã. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST)‚Äã * SFY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/sfy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Zacks.com](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SFY/holding)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SFY/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST)  **Key Observations:**  * Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. * Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. * Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.  It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.  I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:  1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. 2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&amp;P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. 3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. 4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. 5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. 6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.  It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.  **What are your thoughts?**,;,; 2024-01-24 21:46:21]
[Investment plan for about 85 000$ USD over the coming year,;,; So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years.  I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030.  However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.  I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.  The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)  Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco **S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&amp;P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)  So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?  Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :),;,; 2023-07-17 13:28:09]

[ATH | Leverage | Index Funds and more,;,; I got a few questions as a newbie  &amp;#x200B;  1. Some of the companies I want to invest long-term are either at their ATH or close to ATH, like Microsoft  or Nvidia. I'm wondering whether I should wait for it to drop, because most of the stock market is green this year, so I have a feeling it may drop since it grew so much, what do you think? Some of it just recovered from 2022 to it's pre-2022 state, but Nvidia has 205% growth this year, which is crazy 2. Index funds - the legendary S&amp;P 500. Everyone says it's the most stable etc - but I've found other indexes with even better growth. SP500 usually have the 7-10% yearly return and last 5 years went up 56%, but for example the INDEX Vanguard Growth ETF went up 87% for the last 5 years - and it was also a steady growth, not a lucky spike during one period. What do you think, is it really smart to go with SP500 or are there other ones that are much better, even tho SP500 is so hyped by everyone? and if you agree - what other indexes with better return would you recommend? 3. Leverage - I'm not familiar with how much can you leverage in stocks, but for people that invest in the top 10, which most likely will go up in the future, wouldn't be smarter to invest it with i.e 5x leverage, since the companies like Microsoft are stable, and eventually will grow?  4. Stock Math  - let's say I invest $10.000 in a stock and it declines -50%. I know have $5.000. If it goes up by 50%, do I get $7.500 or do I get my $10.000 back? Logically the first answer, but something doesn't give me a peace of mind here, so I prefer to ask 5. Eli Lilly - what do you think about this stock? Growed massive amount lately, and pharmaceutical industry will definitely be there in 5 or 10 years.,;,; 2023-11-06 14:10:12]

In addition, Palantir is now [eligible](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/palantir-stock-forecast-pltr-price-surges-21-after-q3-earnings-beat-on-top-and-bottom-202311021434) for inclusion in the S&amp;P 500, signifying its growing importance in the financial market.  The company's [third-quarter earnings](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-movers-0fab2fba) report indicates a notable shift towards the commercial market, reducing its reliance on government contracts (55% actually). Furthermore, Palantir has achieved profitability for the fourth consecutive quarter. It's worth noting that the company is debt-free and holds $3.3 billion in cash and short-term equivalents.  From a technical perspective, it's important to be cautious as there isn't a clear long-term support level for the stock. Currently, the stock is trading at over 15 times its projected 2023 revenue, with earnings expected to grow at a rate exceeding 80% per year (PE ratio reduction can be due to earning increase or value reduction).  However, Palantir still needs to focus on increasing its profit margin, which stood at 1%, 2%, and 7% in the last three quarters, respectively.  Is Palantir destined to become the next major tech company, or is it simply generating hype without substantial substance?  Thank you,;,; 2023-11-05 07:52:58]

[AMD has rebounded to $100, and it‚Äôs just the beginning,;,; With [Nvidia](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-NVDA/?ainvest_channel_token=reddit0327) stock price approaching all-time high, it could be also a good time to invest in AMD, which once hit an all-time high of $161 in November 2021.  Stone Fox Capital believes chip demand should back to growing mode as the inventory adjustment comes to an end. The company is strongly bullish on AMD, saying with the stock only rebounding to $100, it should has plenty of upside in the next few years.  [AMD](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AMD/?ainvest_channel_token=reddit0327) shares had once fallen all the way to a history low of under $55, and its data center CPU market share still has nowhere near Intel. As the market expected industries such as personal computers to start recovering, AMD rallied all the way to $100.  Counterpoint Research estimates that AMD holds about 20% of data centre CPU market in 2022, up from nearly 12% in 2021. In 2022, AMD generated $5.75 billion in revenue from data centre CPUs. If the company doubles its market share to 40%, its revenue will jump to $11.5 billion, while Intel holds a 50% market share.  With the launch of the new chips, [AMD](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AMD/?ainvest_channel_token=reddit0327) is expected to benefit from the huge demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI). The potential market size for AMD could soar from US$79 billion in 2020 to US$300 billion in 2027.  And getting back to $100 is only the beginning, as this is where it should be in last year.  Stone Fox Capital believes that [AMD](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AMD/?ainvest_channel_token=reddit0327) is on track to gain another $100 in the next few years, considering its P/E ratio is still less than half of Nvidia's expected P/E ratio.  Prior to the PC inventory adjustment, AMD's gross margins were close to around 50%. Higher margins and total revenue is driving the company's eps rising significantly.  Analysts have lowered their eps targets due to the weak demand environment and are now targeting above $4 and $5 for 2024 and 2025 respectively. Considering that these estimates are based on limited revenue growth expectations, there is still room for further growing.  Anyway, [AMD](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AMD/?ainvest_channel_token=reddit0327)'s shares are trading at just 23 times of its 2024 eps target. Stone Fox Capital's previous research showed that AMD's revenue was only US$32 billion, but its eps was close to $6. Stone Fox expects the chip company to reach its target level much sooner than analysts had predicted due to a rebound in end market demand, and AMD taking more market share from Intel in the server market.

A 96% drop from its peak valuation.  https://preview.redd.it/8q2llffuf43b1.png?width=440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac77427a41b396f17b14e771db149c91fba320e4  If history is any guide, buying growth stocks that trade at 10x sales provides significantly lower returns than the broad market.  https://preview.redd.it/vyqg6r2vf43b1.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88098ea5bbb4206be89ee9a0f333ee2efd873cb2  If your aim is to outperform the market, you have a much better chance with value investing. Warren Buffett once showcased a group of investors who used the simple principle of buying value stocks with a significant margin of safety to beat the market for decades running.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ogzm2htvf43b1.png?width=859&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77475cf89b16b9f7645e77d0dc2e78e11e6ce3ce  Value Investing tends to outperform the market over long periods of time. The catch is that there would be significant time periods in which you will underperform the market (e.g. 2010-2021).  https://preview.redd.it/xzilg5pwf43b1.png?width=672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c957fade72701e25e47fe00689e0eb99b74fca1b  Buffett goes on to highlight that Value Investing has nothing to do with brain power and everything to do with the right mental fortitude.  https://preview.redd.it/z4pqxkfxf43b1.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=689f283addacebcf39246baaf531e29e8ea6d628,;,; 2023-05-31 02:44:02]
[$NVDA 1D Technical Analysis,;,; View my 1D chart analysis for Nvidia below, what do you guys think? With the AI boom showing no signs of slowing down (at least not that I'm aware of), I like the company on a fundamental level and have a few shares at around $300, so I'm just looking to add to my position at this point. The circled levels represent the next entry points I'll be looking to get in at.  For reference, my next potential entries will depend on developments in the bigger-picture macro sentiment toward artificial intelligence &amp; microchip industries, but for now, are as follows: entry #1 is around $445, entry #2 is around $410, and entry #3 around $375. Was thinking I would add 1 or 2 shares at entry 1, and then larger numbers of shares if price action takes us down to the other 2 circled areas.

[Tesla ($TSLA) stock and six other tech titans are responsible for 86% of the S&amp;P 500 2023 performance.,;,;    Tesla($TSLA) stock **plunged nearly 10% last week on earnings**. That caught everyone's attention, but it was just the tip of the iceberg.  0 seconds of 14 secondsVolume 0%   With roughly one-third of the S&amp;P 500 companies **announcing quarterly earnings results this week**, there are none bigger than tech titans **Alphabet** ($**GOOGL**), **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**) and **Meta Platforms** ($META). These four Big Tech stocks alone account for 41% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 year-to-date gain, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.  Adding **Apple** ($**AAPL**), which reports next week, **Nvidia** ($**NVDA**) and **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) stock, Colas says these seven tech giants account for 86% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 gain, which was 7.7% through Monday's close. These seven Big Tech stocks have rallied far more than the S&amp;P 500 this year.  According to Colas, there have been three drivers of outperformance for these tech leaders. First, all seven were deeply oversold at the end of 2022 and received a "January Effect" bounce.  The January Effect is a seasonal increase in stock prices throughout the month of January. The increase in demand for stocks in January is often preceded by a decrease in prices during the month of December, in part due to tax-loss harvesting.     Second, many of these tech companies have been aggressively cutting costs, so earnings power should now be higher than last year. And, finally, interest rates have declined, supporting the valuation of high-multiple stocks, he added.  ## Alphabet, Microsoft Earnings Due  Google-owner Alphabet reports earnings after the closing bell Tuesday. Shares are just below a 106.69 buy point in a **cup with handle**, according to **IBD MarketSmith** chart analysis.  Alphabet earnings are expected to measure $1.08 a share on revenue of $68.8 billion.  Dow Jones software giant Microsoft slid almost 2% midday Tuesday, threatening to extend a losing streak to four sessions ahead of the company's earnings results late Tuesday. MSFT stock is rolling back toward a 276.86 buy point in a **flat base** following a March 17 breakout.  Wall Street expects Microsoft to earn $2.24 a share on revenue of $51.0 billion, per FactSet estimates.     ## Amazon, Meta Earnings Also On Deck  E-commerce giant Amazon continues to trace the right side of a **cup base**, but is seeing resistance around its long-term 200-day moving average.  With earnings due out late Thursday, Amazon is expected to earn 21 cents a share on sales of $124.5 billion.  Facebook parent Meta Platforms will report Wednesday after the stock market closes. Meta stock is out of buy range past a **197.26 buy point** in a flat base, but receding.  The social media giant is expected to earn $2.02 a share on revenue of $27.6 billion.  ## Apple Earnings Next Week  Apple shares reversed squarely lower midday Tuesday. Still, they remain solidly above a 157.48 buy point and at the top of the **5% buy range** that runs up to 165.35.  The Dow Jones tech giant reports its fiscal second-quarter results on May 4. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to earn $1.43 a share on sales of $92.9 billion.     ## Nvidia Holds Up; Tesla Stock Breaks Down  Graphics-chip maker Nvidia remains near its recent highs despite sharp losses midday Tuesday. Shares declined more than 2% in afternoon trade.  The **IBD Leaderboard stock** broke out past a 230.59 handle buy point after the **company's strong earnings on Feb. 23**.  Electric-vehicle giant Tesla stock continues to trade near its lowest level since Jan. 26. In recent weeks, shares triggered the **7%-8% loss rule** from a buy point at 200.76 in a cup with handle.

[[Week 2] AI momentum trading journey guided by chat GPT/LLM. Feedback welcome,;,; This is a follow-up on my latest AI trading post where I laid out my short/mid term bullish case on the AI supply chain due to major upcoming disruption driven by policy and private/public markets. Those are:  1. **The Fed‚Äôning:** Major increase in government expenditure in relation to Global GDP that will trickle down into the AI economy. 2. **The upcoming major IOT adoption via regulatory enforcement:** FSMA food traceability act compliance deadline is fast approaching, Chipps Act, etc. 3. **Upstream/Downstream innovation in private markets:** Early stage capital has commoditized AI (APIs, et al.)  with billions of dollars of VC funding. This early stage innovation will trickle down  into public markets sooner that expected.

[What could actually destabilize the stock market right now?,;,; I'll start. I want to read others opinions and ideas.      The general consensus right now is we're going through great weather in the stock market, smooth sailing. Maybe even a lot of confidence to be surfing the big waves. There are some things I see on the horizon.     1. The AI transition, although has the potential to do great things, is not being adopted so fast and in the pertient areas for actual economic growth. Because of this, AI as a tool for economic growth will plateu for a couple of years. Even though it's great, it has serious limitations right now and can't help whomever do something beyond their own capabilities to a degree that makes them as competent as an expert human being. Coding wise I can tell that much is certain. So I anticipate a disilusion coming from the AI expectations that are out there soon to bring the market down. Specially Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, etc. 2. There is a serious disconnect between low income and high income people. Low income being the vast majority. This is causing insecurity to rise and creep into areas where that wasn't a problem before. As a consequence... low income people will save instead of spend, and high income people will keep spending, creating an unrealistic measurement of how the economy is doing. This will keep inflation and the prices of goods from coming down, preventing economic growth to come from both low, medium and high income populations. Making the FED reconsider lowering rates as inflation numbers are updated. 3. Slowly but surely companies will let go of staff and the unemployment number will go up. Adding weight to the idea that raising rates is a no go for now. High unemployment levels can lead to decreased consumer spending, further slowing economic growth and complicating efforts to combat inflation. 4. Group monopolization: Tech companies and a relatively small group of companies are taking most of the pie. This imbalance will have an effect on the quality of goods being produced. Only a handful of options will be left to choose from and the will of entreprenours will be eroded from not being able to compete with companies who can keep financing the production of their products regardless of their bad quality. So a general lack of doing business motivation will permeate the air and consumers could attempt to simply stop purchasing and going the DIY route. 5. Europe in general seems to be in a hole. Swiss banks will have some turbulence in the near, medium term future; the debt of countries like Greece, Italy, Spain, etc will just start adding up and making the Euro currency to continue to lose value against other currencies. 6. Geopolitical tensions could escalate in different fronts and cause bottlenecks in production, transportation, travel, etc. You have the US-China relationship disputing technology and intellectual property rights and creating a competition with other countries for where goods are produced to be imported to the US. Escalation in tensions could bring about tariffs, sanctions, or retaliatory measures. There's also the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel-Gaza situation, Iran and Western countries over nuclear programs, other oil producing nations and the oil pricing situation. 7. US elections coming soon.     Considering this and the list below of what has triggered the US stock market to go down at least 20%, what do you see creeping up, potentially, as a catalyst for the market to flip to bear territory?     1. **1973-1974 Stock Market Crash**: Triggered by the oil crisis following the Yom Kippur War, when OAPEC (Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries) proclaimed an oil embargo. This, coupled with high inflation, stagnating economic growth (stagflation), and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, led to a severe bear market. 2. **Early 1980s Recession**: High inflation rates, exacerbated by oil price shocks and aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker to combat inflation, led to a severe recession and a significant market downturn in the early 1980s. 3. **Black Monday, 1987**: On October 19, 1987, stock markets around the world crashed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropping by 22% in a single day. Factors included trade deficits, rising interest rates, and overvaluation, but the crash was exacerbated by the widespread use of portfolio insurance and automated trading systems. 4. **Dot-com Bubble Burst, 2000-2002**: After years of speculative investment in internet-based companies, the bubble burst in 2000, leading to a significant market correction. Many tech companies saw their stock values plummet, leading to a broader market downturn and a mild recession. 5. **Global Financial Crisis, 2007-2009**: Triggered by the collapse of the housing bubble in the United States, leading to a crisis in subprime mortgages and a severe liquidity crunch. This crisis quickly spread globally, leading to significant declines in stock markets worldwide, bank failures, and a deep global recession. 6. **COVID-19 Pandemic, 2020**: The global outbreak of COVID-19 led to unprecedented economic disruption, as governments around the world imposed lockdowns and travel restrictions to combat the pandemic. The uncertainty and sudden stop in economic activity led to a sharp, but relatively short-lived, market downturn in March 2020.,;,; 2024-02-12 03:31:16]
[Worse case scenario: the perfect Bear cocktail,;,; After reading all the comments from my last post and doing some more thinking. I decided to entertain the idea of what would be the perfect Bear cocktail that could trigger a Stock Market destabilization. I'm not taking into account any type of positive news. I'm simply going the negative route, in a slow and systematic manner, without any huge trigger events.  What am I missing and at what dates that's important and could also add to this?  If you notice in the prior post list, three out of six times... rising interest rates were part of the cause that brought the market down at least 20%. Oil price shocks two out of 6. Then there¬¥s speculative investments at the dotcom bubble. Covid, overvaluation, trade tensions... Stagflation. So these have to be in the mix one way or another:     Cocktail Potential Ingredients:   1. Rising interest rates.   2. Oil price shocks.   3. Speculative tech investments.   4. Overvaluation.   5. Trade tensions.   6. Stagflation.   7. New round of Covid-19.   8. Housing or Commercial Real Estate Bubble.     So this is the speculative worse case scenario we could have without going as far as having a WWIII:     February 13, 2024: CPI report comes in hot. S&amp;P500 comes down 1.5%, some buy the tiny dip.   February 15, 2024: Jobless claims rise. Doesn't alter the market but adds to the cocktail mix.  February 16, 2024: A higher-than-expected PPI indicates increasing costs at the producer level, which can signal rising inflationary pressures. Producers might pass these higher costs onto consumers, leading to an increase in consumer prices and overall inflation. The Fed to consider tightening monetary policy more aggressively than previously anticipated to combat inflation. This could include raising interest rates or adjusting the pace of tapering asset purchases.  Financial markets don't react negatively to a higher-than-expected PPI, as it they priced it in from the CPI report.   February 21, 2024: Nvidia posts earnings, they actually do fine but investors realize that¬¥s gonna be the ceiling for now so the stock falls 15%. Other tech stocks get stained by the fear, bringing the S&amp;P500 2.5% lower. AI investment sentiments leans towards potentially speculative for now.  March 12, 2024: February¬¥s CPI report comes in hot again, causing Algorithmic trades to sell and bring down the S&amp;P500 another 2%.  March 19-20, 2024: FOMC Meeting gives subtext of potentially not bringing interest rates down yet. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterates emphasis on the central bank's commitment to combating inflation, even if it requires keeping interest rates high for an extended period. This brings down the market sentiment down and numbers another 1%.   April 5, 2024:  In a CNBC YouTube video report, experts delve into the complexities of the current commercial real estate (CRE) market. The rise of remote work led to a decreased demand for office spaces, the pandemic trained people to make purchases online, commercial real estate bubble starts to show symptoms of cracking up.   April 10, 2024: CPI report is on ambiguous. Not up, not down. Anything could happen at this point. Aprils report will define what the FED will do and the next 6 months of stock market activity. Market loses .5%  April 17, 2024: Tom Lee's bullish perspective has been challenged by the prior events and during an interview he mentions that this was the turmoil he had been expecting but sees the S&amp;P500 going back to 5,200 points by the end of the year. Currently at 4,600... 7.5% below all time highs.  May 1, 2024: FOMC Meeting leaves a bad taste in mouth. Jerome shifts narrative towards not lowering interests rates yet. Market falls another 2.5% on the bad sentiment.  May 15, 2024:  Situations in the Middle East, such as tensions in Gaza or Iran, could impact global oil supplies by affecting regional stability and energy infrastructure. Saudi Arabia, a key OPEC member, might alter its oil production strategy in response to shifts in global politics, economic pressures, or changes in energy demand. Actions perceived as irrational could stem from strategic decisions to protect national interests, influence oil prices, or respond to international events. S&amp;P500 falls 0.5%.  July 8, 2024: A new wave of Covid-19 actually breaks through the collective deceit of it being over because death rates rise significantly and word spreads out again from hospital staff that's it's getting real bad. Stock market reacts in a mixed manner. Amazon and tech companies go up a little, small caps enter another bad rout. S&amp;P500 falls 1%.  July 20, 2024: Numbers start to confirm a Stagflation situation actually taking place. A significant slowdown in economic growth, rising unemployment rates, declining consumer spending, and a contraction in manufacturing. Inflation pressures, coupled with tightening monetary policies aimed at controlling price levels, contribute to decreased economic activity. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions serve as catalysts, further straining global markets. The interconnectedness of these factors in precipitate a recessionary environment. S&amp;P500 falls .7%.  July 23, 2024: Nvidia reports and disappoints, falls another 8% in tandem with other tech companies.  July 25, 2024: Commercial Real Estate bubble pops and hits the news hard. S&amp;P500 falls 1.4% At 13.6% the all time highs from January 2024. Currently at 4,400 points.  August 14, 2024: After all the earnings reports it becomes increasingly clear: the FED won't lower rates and will keep them there for longer than expected; consumer spending is declining, companies keep firing people, the Bear narrative takes over. The S&amp;P500 falls to 4,010 points. 23.5% below all time highs. It stays around here for the next 6 months, falls further and gets better by the end of 2025.   ,;,; 2024-02-13 19:00:48]

In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.  &amp;#x200B;  It‚Äôs an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inflation battle, noted FactSet‚Äôs Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 top performing days for the S&amp;P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday‚Äôs close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish.

Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&amp;P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.  &amp;#x200B;  Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&amp;P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  That didn‚Äôt mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.  &amp;#x200B;  Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.  &amp;#x200B;  Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.  &amp;#x200B;  The strategy ‚Äúindicates the Fed‚Äôs measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,‚Äù Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&amp;P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks‚Äô bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group‚Äôs announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.  &amp;#x200B;  SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a ‚Äúmini‚Äù banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.  &amp;#x200B;  Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks ‚Äî Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%,  and Meta Platforms Inc.  META, 0.56%.  &amp;#x200B;  See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?  &amp;#x200B;  Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high:  &amp;#x200B;  The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs overall return, he wrote, with the company‚Äôs success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.,;,; 2023-12-27 15:52:27]

[IonQ Pursues a Revolutionary Step in AI: Striving to Develop Quantum Machine Learning Models Matching Human Cognitive Abilities,;,; IonQ, a quantum computing company, is aiming to pioneer Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models that can rival the capabilities of human intelligence. The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.  &amp;#x200B;  In terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities. Their next major technical milestone is achieving 35 algorithmic qubits (AQ) which, beyond this point, will make it more cost-effective to run models on actual quantum machines than simulating them classically. IonQ also collaborates with leading tech companies like Amazon, Dell, Microsoft, and NVIDIA to integrate their quantum technology with the partners' AI and machine learning expertise.  &amp;#x200B;  Further, IonQ is venturing into Quantum Artificial Intelligence and has already published research on modeling human cognition. This field of study employs quantum computers to simulate human cognition, potentially offering powerful insights into artificial general intelligence (AGI).,;,; 2023-06-03 08:24:05]

[Stock-picking dog beats AI in sniffing out winners,;,; "Artificial intelligence programmes are now capable of seducing lonely humans, writing Hollywood dialogue and even turning out passable imitations of Oasis songs.  One thing they cannot yet do, however, is pick a stock portfolio with any more success than a rescue dog can, if an experiment in Germany is anything to go by.  Freddy, an eight-year-old Maltese cross who selected shares by gravitating towards treats laid out on slips of paper, trounced a set of recommendations from ChatGPT, achieving nearly four times the returns delivered by the AI over the course of six weeks.  Since the mid-19th century financial theorists have debated whether skill and knowledge are really any better guide than the vagaries of chance when placing bets on the markets. In various tests schoolchildren, animals and darts carelessly flung at a wall have outperformed human experts.  In the 2000s the Chicago Sun-Times hired as its star investment columnist a capuchin monkey called Adam Monk, who chose stocks by circling items in the business pages with a red felt-tip pen. More often than not he beat leading financial analysts.  This time, however, the German magazine WirtschaftsWoche pitted Freddy against an AI in one of the first contests of its kind, with each given a notional war chest of ‚Ç¨19,000 to spend on shares in 15 companies.  While ChatGPT is not set up to issue specific investment suggestions, it volunteered to assemble a ‚Äúdiversified portfolio of stocks [in firms] that demonstrate solid accounts, have growing sales, remain profitable and have a high market capitalisation‚Äù.   Its relatively conservative picks, ranging from dominant tech corporations such as Apple and Amazon to well-known consumer-focused businesses such as McDonald‚Äôs and CocaCola, yielded a respectable but unspectacular 3.5 per cent.  Freddy, on the other hand, perhaps inured to the cut-throat caprices of life by his youth as a stray dog on the streets of Istanbul, bet heavily on energy, AI and technological hardware. While this Warren Wooffett‚Äôs forays into bitcoin and oil went a little sour, punts on Nvidia, a high-end chipmaker, and Uniper, a troubled German energy conglomerate, paid off handsomely.  His total return of 13.5 per cent outclassed not only the AI but also the majority of normal investment funds.  ‚ÄúHe did a great job,‚Äù Ali Masarwah, director of the Envestor fund platform, told the magazine. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather trust Freddy than the AI with my money.‚Äù,;,; 2023-07-11 08:00:21]

[The Rise of Data Centers: An Alternative to NVDA‚Äôs Dominance in the AI Market.,;,; Wall Street Awakens to New Opportunities Amidst Overvaluation Concerns and NVDA‚Äôs Vulnerabilities  In recent times, the technology landscape has been dominated by the impressive growth and innovation of companies like Nvidia (NVDA), which have become synonymous with artificial intelligence (AI) advancements. However, a new contender has emerged, challenging the notion that NVDA is the sole option for investors seeking exposure to the AI market. Data centers, once considered a supporting player, are now positioning themselves as formidable alternatives with the potential to not only rival but surpass the computing power of NVDA. This article explores the rise of data centers and the vulnerabilities of NVDA, shedding light on the implications they pose for investors amidst concerns of NVDA‚Äôs overvaluation on Wall Street.  The Alternative Powerhouses: Data centers have traditionally served as the backbone of cloud computing, storing vast amounts of information and providing processing capabilities to various industries. However, with the exponential growth of AI applications, data centers have evolved into powerhouses capable of supporting complex computational tasks and training neural networks. Unlike NVDA, which primarily focuses on semiconductors, data centers possess the infrastructure, scalability, and dedicated resources required to handle the intensive computing demands of AI algorithms. They are now ready to challenge NVDA‚Äôs dominance in terms of computing power and offer a more diverse investment opportunity in the semiconductor market.  Overvaluation Concerns and Market Perception: The buzz surrounding NVDA‚Äôs achievements has led to concerns of overvaluation as investors rush to invest in what was once considered the primary AI play. The stock‚Äôs valuation has skyrocketed, raising questions about its sustainability. However, market perceptions are shifting, driven by the emergence of data centers as a compelling alternative. Savvy investors are recognizing the potential benefits of diversifying their portfolios and exploring opportunities beyond NVDA, which could protect them from the risks associated with an overvalued stock.  The Shift in Market Dynamics: The financial landscape is dynamic and ever-evolving, with market sentiment and trends constantly shifting. The growing recognition of data centers as a powerful alternative to NVDA signals a potential turning point in the AI market. As the market becomes saturated with NVDA investments, the demand for alternative investment opportunities is expected to surge.  Blackstone‚Äôs Strategic Focus: Notably, Blackstone, a prominent player in the investment landscape, has already made a decisive move in favor of data centers. Recognizing the changing and highly competitive nature of the semiconductor sector, Blackstone has chosen to prioritize investments in data centers. This strategic shift underscores their confidence and foresight, as they find valuations more favorable and growth more prominent in the data center market.  Investing in Data Centers: A Viable Strategy? Given the increasing competitiveness of data centers, investors seeking exposure to the AI market may find it wise to explore this emerging sector. Data centers provide a robust and diversified approach, offering access to a range of companies harnessing AI capabilities. By investing in data centers, individuals can capitalize on the growing demand for AI-driven computing power while mitigating the risks associated with NVDA‚Äôs vulnerabilities and potential overvaluation.  Conclusion: The dominance of NVDA in the AI market is no longer assured, as data centers rise to prominence and challenge its position. While NVDA has undoubtedly been at the forefront of AI advancements, the emergence of data centers as a formidable alternative cannot be ignored. Investors are increasingly recognizing the value of diversifying their portfolios and exploring alternative opportunities beyond NVDA‚Äôs potential overvaluation. Wall Street is awakening to the vulnerabilities of NVDA and the immense potential of data centers, which are poised to reshape the investment landscape and provide a broader array of opportunities in the AI market. Blackstone‚Äôs strategic focus on data centers further solidifies their importance in the shifting technological landscape.,;,; 2023-07-17 15:59:44]

[What's the difference between free float, free float market cap and shares outstanding?,;,; Correct me if I'm wrong . Shares outstanding is 100% all shares that exist. Free float are shares that are readily available for trade, excludes shares that are locked up from insiders. I'm still a bit confused to what free float market cap is. I looked up a few sources and it seems like they use the term shares outstanding and free float market cap. I think free float market cap is the free float times the share price , if it is why bother coming up with the term free float market cap. why not just use market cap instead?  If the value of free float market cap is free float times share price, then what value do the shares outstanding have since we calculate free float times share price and not shares outstanding times share price?   Free float and shares outstanding is a count of shares and free float market cap is the total  value of shares?,;,; 2023-09-04 18:27:25]

[Dow Jones rises but leaders tumble, and Tesla ($TSLA) stock triggers the sell rule.,;,;  Dow Jones futures were little changed early Thursday, along with S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The stock market rally struggled Wednesday as weak economic data raised recession fears for a second straight session.    The major indexes still don't look too bad, with the Nasdaq sliding but the Dow Jones rising.  But once again, declining stocks decisively beat winners. Once again, many of those losers fell hard. But on Wednesday, a lot of more of those big losers were leading stocks, such as **On Holding** ($**ONON**), **MarketAxess** ($**MKTX**) and **PagerDuty** ($**PD**). **C3.ai** ($**AI**) sold off for a second session, with the AI stock now staging a massive, outside week to the downside.  Others, including many chip names, declined solidly, now showing more chart damage after relatively modest retreats Tuesday.  **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) skidded for a third straight day, triggering the automatic sell rule.   Megacap techs such as **Apple** ($**AAPL**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**), Google parent **Alphabet** (**GOOGL**), **Meta Platforms** ($**META**) and **Nvidia** all fell.  Meanwhile, bank stocks came under more pressure. **Western Alliance Bancorp** (**WAL**) plunged, leading a retreat in regional banks, though they pared losses in the afternoon. **Charles Schwab**hit a two-year closing low. While bank deposits may be relatively safe, the bigger issue now may be long-term bank profitability as well as lending curbs that rapidly slow the economy.  Medical names are looking relatively strong, along with other defensive growth or defensive plays.  PagerDuty stock, On Holding, Meta and Nvidia are on **IBD Leaderboard**. Microsoft and Google stock are on the **IBD Long-Term Leaders** list.   Despite relatively benign action in the major indexes, the weakness in growth and other leading stocks is concerning. Investors should be looking to protect profits and cut losses.  ## Costco Sales Weak  Costco same-store sales fell 1.1% in March vs. a year earlier, the first decline in nearly three years. U.S. comps slid 1.5%. Excluding gasoline and currency effects, comps rose 2.6% or 0.9% in the U.S. E-commerce comps tumbled 11.6%. COST stock fell modestly.  ## Dow Jones Futures Today  Dow Jones futures edged higher vs. fair value. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.2%.  The Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. That follows unexpectedly weak February job openings and the March ADP Employment Report. Labor will release the March jobs report on Friday morning, but U.S. markets will be closed.   ## Stock Market Rally  The stock market rally had a generally negative session, despite the mixed action on the major indexes.  The ADP Employment Report showed private payrolls rose much less than expected in March, a day after a big drop in February job openings. The March ISM services index fell more than expected, signaling rapidly slowing growth.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% in Wednesday's **stock market trading**. The S&amp;P 500 index dipped 0.25%. The Nasdaq composite retreated 1.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 1%.  U.S. crude oil prices dipped 0.1% to $80.61 a barrel.  The 10-year Treasury yield declined 5 basis points to 3.285%. That's the lowest point in nearly seven months. The 2-year Treasury yield sank 7 basis points to 3.76%, off 34 basis points in the past four sessions.  ## ETFs  Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ($**FFTY**) shed 1.9%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ($**BOUT**) gave up 0.65%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ($**IGV**) slipped 1.3%. Microsoft stock and a few other heavyweights dominate IGV, while more-speculative software names like PagerDuty suffered bigger losses. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([**SMH**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) gave up 1.75%, with NVDA stock a major holding.  Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF ($**ARKK**) slumped 3.6% and ARK Genomics ETF (**ARKG**) shed 1.8%. TSLA stock is the top holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. Some Ark funds also own PD stock.  SPDR S&amp;P Metals &amp; Mining ETF (**XME**) retreated 1.15% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (**PAVE**) 1.7%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (**JETS**) and SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (**XHB**) descended 1.5%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (**XLE**) climbed 1.5% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (**XLV**) rallied 1.7% to its best level since Feb. 14.  ## Bank Stocks  The Financial Select SPDR ETF (**XLF**) edged down 0.1%, with SCHW stock a top 10 holding. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (**KRE**), which includes WAL stock, sank 1% but finished off lows.  Western Alliance stock plunged as much as 19.4% after releasing some financial metrics but not disclosing deposits. Shares came off their lows as the California-based bank disclosed deposits fell 11% on March 31 vs. the end of 2022, not as bad as some feared. Still, WAL stock closed down 12.4%.,;,; 2023-04-06 11:23:50]

Bearish!  2. Faraday Future (FFIE.O) announced an employee incentive program to accelerate production of the FF91 Futurist.  Good!  3. Xiaopeng Automotive (XPEV.N) officially announced the launch of two new vehicles in the Netherlands, the upgraded sports sedan P7 and the urban crossover G9, with starting prices of ‚Ç¨49,900 and ‚Ç¨57,990 respectively.  Good news  N.N. plans to build its first battery plant in Hefei, China, with an annual battery capacity of 40 GWh. The large cylindrical battery models to be put into production will mainly be 4680 and 4695.  Favorable  5. TSMC (TSM.N) responded to the construction of a second fab in Japan, said that there is no further information; TSMC President Wei Zhejia had previously said in January to consider building a factory.  No great significance, the core lies in Nvidia's stock fell today   6. Supply chain sources revealed that Apple (AAPL.O) iPhone 15 series will upgrade the OLED driver chip process from 40nm HV to 28nm HV, a change that will help further reduce power consumption and improve battery life.  This information has no short-term boosting effect due to the fight for rights.  7. Beyond Meat (BYND.O): Q4 2022 revenue declined 20.6% year-over-year to $79.9 million but was above market expectations of $75.7 million, with a net loss of $66.9 million, narrowing from a loss of $80.4 million a year earlier.  Short Interest  8. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD.O): Q4 2022 revenue of $11.01 billion, adjusted loss of $0.83 per share and 96.1 million total subscribers, both worse than market expectations.  Negative  9. It is reported that the European Union Intellectual Property Office recently ruled that Azera (NIO.N) ES8/ES6 and Audi's S8/S6 do not constitute confusing similarity, and therefore rejected Audi's request.  Favorable  10. Opendoor (OPEN.O): Q4 2022 revenue fell 25.25% year-over-year to $2.86 billion, but better than market expectations of $2.51 billion, with a loss of $0.63 per share, a significant widening from a loss of $0.13 a year earlier.  Negative  11. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Boeing (BA.N) halted deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner after it found a problem with the "analysis" of a component.  Interesting  12. The U.S. Department of Justice plans to file an antitrust lawsuit aimed at blocking Adobe's (ADBE.O) planned $20 billion acquisition of Figma, a developer of a cloud computing web platform.  Negative  13. The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended denial of marketing authorization for Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme's (MRK.N) new crown oral drug Lagevrio.  Negative  Today's information side of the analysis suggested: the information brought by the news side of the information selection factors, today's core or the release of pre-market PCE data, if it is in line with expectations, the stock market will rise, if it is beyond expectations, the market will plunge. It is expected that today's pre-market decline is too large, the probability of the stock market will fall today.,;,; 2023-02-24 12:45:50]

[Best way to minimise our losses as a retail trader ‚Ä¶,;,; In this post i will try point out some of my experiences from the years of trading in the equity market, how we all retail traders can minimize our losses via just implementing 4 different ideas in your trading style so we can have the edge over others and how we can intellectually find some good trades.// please feel free to add your ideas , strategies how you trade, your principles of trading and give me suggestion in the comments if I wrote something wrong   1.ATTITUDE- First of all ,what's trading its prediction right ,in every trade don‚Äôt try to be expert don‚Äôt try to predict every hour , every day, every week in the market its nearly impossible to catch the obvious moves, because generally everybody knows it and it is already priced in the asset price. You should know what to stake and when to take a loss. Always think markets are supreme and never say I was right and market is wrong otherwise you will never learn. My golden rule in trading is "following the momentum" price is the first indicator which will tell you ,you are wrong instantly exit from your position with the small loss. Always remember this quote "you have to loose many battles to win a war" don't be emotionally connected to a trade    2. TECHNIQUE-You should know know your trading technique, way better than anyone else lets take the common example of option strategy if you think your bullish,exactly how much bullish you are and what strategy suits you either it is debit call spread to cut your cost for entry but never feel greedy or fearful about any trade because you have to leave your emotions at home when you are competing with the heavy hedge funds and high net worth traders which want to suck your money out of your veins and wanna try to bankrupt you ,it seems so obvious but i have seem shit tone of post people screaming about what to do next because they don't know about volatility crush,they didn't had any exit plan and they don't know what to do when your strategy backfire at you try to have a plan for example if you are playing earnings what I will do if volatility drops what i will do if the volatility increases because people don't know market don't price in 2 times on the same news. They usually see gains and they will feel euphoria because they are right and they usually don't close the position for the gains because now they are expecting more from the market which ultimately make them to loose ton of money (always trade with a stop loss)   3.UNDERSTANDING THE MARKET-the most important aspect of trading is to know what is the state of market or economy which will provide you a broad direction which is the backbone of any strategy you will imply. It is important to have a knowledge of the clear trend of the market, always keep on the eye on the upcoming events in the economy which can effect the markets major events like GDP releases , have a close look on fed decisions and it is gonna effect the markets you should be ahead of the most of the public because most of the people are too lazy to see the charts,data on time and there whole focus is to buy and selling securities without having the idea of the broad direction of the market. Always compare it with how other country's economy has affected them then you can get the idea. Other indicators such as Non-farm payrolls, inflation, dollar strength or weakness because it is gonna affect the exporting and importing companies sooner or later, the price of the crude oil can think how this gonna affect my trading companies for example cut of production in the OPEC results in the profit of the companies like ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, Pioneer Energy if you had an edge you could have reap the profit from this news.   4.FUNDAMENTALS-For me, its important to see the technical analysis of the stock price to see the future price is fine ,but having a strong grip on the fundamentals of the company always gives you an edge over the other traders who are just following the momentum for the profit or who are just buying calls or puts because they heard on CNBC that it has a huge upside and it will have a crazy earnings next quarter. If you had read the balance sheet ,income statement and cash flow right by seeing all the factors such as EPS, debt and hell lot of others. You can identify the patterns which other people cannot look upon because sometimes the business model is right company is profitable everything going good but share price is really down which will give you a advantage to make a trading decision.   But also lemme clear you one thing which is "The shares are gonna come to its mean value which is for sure but when nobody knows many had tried to short the NVIDIA and TSLA and went bankrupt because they thought its too expensive but they forgot the rule no 1 about don't go against the momentum it will kill you ,if you are not sure about the trend do go against , yes you can make a lot of money to predict a trend reversal as many of you have seen 'The big short movie" and want to become like burry so friend don't go against or at least wait until the trend turns because no one can predict the market too perfectly and it the trend is against you just square off your positions because you have already lost that trade   so guys i have gave enough meat here, I know i can be wrong so please give me your suggestion in your comment section and what to think about it  thanks.,;,; 2023-07-18 11:10:49]

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023.  # **Stocks close higher Friday as investors try to shake off latest bank fears: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/stock-futures-are-up-slightly-as-investors-weigh-bank-troubles-fed-decision.html)** ***** &gt; Stocks rose Friday, reversing their earlier session declines as Deutsche Bank shares pared back some losses. ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 132.28 points, or 0.41%, closing at 32,238.15. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.57%, while Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.3%. The major indexes all had a winning week, with the Dow gaining 0.4% week-to-date as of Friday afternoon, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq gained 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively. ***** &gt; Deutsche Bank‚Äôs U.S.-listed shares slid 3.11% Friday, rebounding from a 7% drop earlier in the trading session. A selloff of shares was triggered after the the German lender‚Äôs credit default swaps jumped, but without an apparent catalyst. The move appeared to raise concerns once again over the health of the European banking industry. Earlier this month, Swiss regulators forced a UBS acquisition of rival Credit Suisse. Deutsche Bank shares traded off their worst levels of the session, which caused major U.S. indexes to also cut their losses. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think that the market overall is neither frightened nor optimistic ‚Äî it‚Äôs simply confused,‚Äù said George Ball, president at Sanders Morris Harris. ‚ÄúThe price action for the last month-and-a-half, including today, is a jumble without any direction or conviction.‚Äù ***** &gt; Ball added that Deutsche Bank is ‚Äúvery sound financially.‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIt could be crippled if there‚Äôs a big loss of confidence and there‚Äôs a run on the bank. There is, however, no fundamental reason why that should occur, other than nervousness.‚Äù ***** &gt; European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde tried to ease concerns, saying euro zone banks are resilient with strong capital and liquidity positions. Lagarde said the ECB could provide liquidity if needed. ***** &gt; Investors continued to assess the Fed‚Äôs latest policy move announced this week. The central bank hiked rates by a quarter-point. However, it also hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be ending soon. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that credit conditions have tightened, which could put pressure on the economy. ***** &gt; On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said regulators are prepared to take more action if needed to stabilize U.S. banks. Her comments are the latest among regulators attempting to buoy confidence in the U.S. banking system in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank closures. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúRetail [and] institutional investors are both looking at the banking system, but now internationally. That‚Äôs dangerous,‚Äù Ball added. ‚ÄúBanks exist because of confidence in their stability, and that confidence can be eroded as we now see, via social media and technology in a matter of minutes.‚Äù  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kYFZ0mb.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/sa1yxWq.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/QsHW7no.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/OGQZBeP.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/uIef67v.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kr3YfHV.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JiYUEBP.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CKcDnul.png))**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vsFHgKf.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mconM20.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H7KFVcz.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ymKQozZ.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TsJcX1J.png))**   *****  &gt; # Best and Worst Stocks Since the COVID Crash Low  &gt; We are now three years out from the COVID Crash low, and even with the past year's weakness, most assets continue to sit on solid gains. For major US index ETFs, the S&amp;P Midcap 400 (IJH) is up the most having slightly more than doubled while the S&amp;P Smallcap 600 (IJR) is not far behind having rallied 95.9%. Value has generally outperformed growth, especially for mid and small-caps although that has shifted somewhat this year. For example, while its gains have been more middling since the COVID crash, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has been the strongest area of the equity market in 2023 thanks to the strength of sectors like Tech (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC). Although those sectors have posted strong gains this year, they have been the weakest over the past three years while Energy (XLE) far and away has been the strongest asset class. Paired with the strength of energy stocks has been solid runs in commodities (DBC)more broadly with the notable exception being Natural Gas (UNG) which has lost over 40%. Bond ETFs are similarly sitting on losses since the COVID Crash lows. As for international markets, Mexico (EWW) and India (PIN) have outpaced the rest of the world although Emerging Markets (EEM) as a whole have not been particularly strong; likely being dragged on by the weaker performance of China (ASHR) which holds a large weight on EEM.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low.png))**  &gt; Taking a look at current S&amp;P 500 members, nearly half of the index has more than doubled over the past three years. As for the absolute best performers, Energy stocks dominate the list with four of the top five best-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks coming from that sector. Targa Resources (TRGP) has been the absolute best performer with a nearly 900% total return. Other notables include a couple of heavy weight stocks: Tesla (TSLA) and NVIDIA (NVDA) with gains of 563.9% and 412.9%, respectively.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low-2.png))**  &gt; On the other end of the spectrum, there are currently 25 stocks that have posted a negative return since the COVID Crash low. The worst has been First Republic Bank (FRC) which has been more of a recent development. Whereas today the stock has posted an 83.1% loss, at the start of this month it would have been a 65% gain. Another standout on the list of worst performers has been Amazon (AMZN). Most other mega caps have more than doubled since the March 2020 S&amp;P 500 low, however, the e-commerce giant has hardly offered a positive return.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # Sector Performance Experiences a Historical Divergence  &gt; The first quarter of 2023 is coming to a close next week, and checking in on year to date performance, there has been a big divergence between the winners and losers. Although the S&amp;P 500 is up 2.84% on the year as of yesterday's close, only three of the eleven sectors are higher. Not only are those three sectors up on the year, but they have posted impressive double digit gains only three months into the year. Of those three, Consumer Discretionary has posted the smallest gain of 10% whereas Technology and Communication Services have risen 17.2% and 18.1%, respectively. The fact that these sectors are home to the main mega cap stocks -- like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have been on an impressive run of late -- helps to explain how the market cap weighted S&amp;P 500 is up on the year without much in the way of healthy breadth on a sector level.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-1a.png))**  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-1.png))**  &gt; One thing that is particularly remarkable about this year's sector performance is just how rare it is for a sector to be up 10%+ (let alone 3) while all other sectors are lower. And that is for any point of the year let alone in the first quarter. As we mentioned in yesterday's Sector Snapshot and show in the charts below, going back to 1990, there have only been two other periods in which a sector has risen at least 10% YTD while all other sectors were lower YTD. The first of those was in May 2009. In a similar instance to now, Consumer Discretionary, Tech, and Materials were the three sectors with double digit gains back then. With those sectors up solidly, the S&amp;P 500 was little changed on the year with a less than 1% gain. As you can see below, though, by the end of 2009, every sector had pushed into positive territory as the new bull market coming out of the global financial crisis was well underway.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-2.png))**  &gt; The next occurrence was much more recent: 2022. Obviously, it was a tough year for equities except for the Energy sector which had a banner year. Throughout most of the year, the sector traded up by well over 20% year to date even while the rest of the equity market was battered.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # The Fed Expects Banking Stress to Substitute for Rate Hikes  &gt; The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 0.25% at their March meeting, bringing it to the 4.75-5.0% range. This is the ninth-straight rate increase and brings rates to their highest level since 2007. However, the most aggressive tightening cycle since the early 1980s, which saw them lift rates all the way from near zero to almost 5%, is near its end.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-target-rate-601x800.png))**  &gt; Up until early February, Fed officials expected to raise rates to a maximum of about 5.1% and hold it there for a while. However, since that time, we‚Äôve gotten a slew of strong economic data, including elevated inflation numbers. This pushed fed officials to give ‚Äúguidance‚Äù that they expected to raise rates by more than they estimated back in December.  &gt; Market expectations for policy also moved in conjunction. Prior to February, markets expected the Fed to raise rates to 5% by June, and subsequently lower them by about 0.5% by the end of the year. But strong incoming data and Fed guidance pushed expectations higher, with the terminal rate moving up to 5.6% and no cuts in 2023.  &gt; # The Silicon Valley Bank crisis changed everything &gt; The bank crisis that erupted over the last couple of weeks resulted in a significant shift, both in expectations for policy and now the Fed as well. See here for our complete rundown on SVB and the ensuing crisis.  &gt; Market expectations for Fed policy rates immediately moved lower. Markets expected the stress in banks to translate to tighter credit conditions, which in turn would lead to slower economic growth and lower inflation.  &gt; This was nicely articulated by Professor Jeremey Siegel, one of the foremost commentators on financial markets and fed policy, in our latest episode of the Facts vs Feelings podcast, Prof. Siegel said that tighter credit conditions, as lending standards become more strict, are de facto rate hikes.  &gt; Fed Chair Powell more or less said exactly the same thing after the Fed‚Äôs March meeting. The 0.25% increase was an attempt to thread the needle between financial stability and fighting inflation. Fed officials also forecast the fed funds rate to hit a maximum of 5.1%, unchanged from their December estimate. This is a marked shift from what was expected just a few weeks ago, with Powell explicitly saying that tighter credit conditions ‚Äúsubstitute‚Äù for rate hikes.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-rate-expectations-600x800.png))**  &gt; # There‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty ahead &gt; While the recent bank stresses are expected to tighten credit conditions and thereby impact economic growth and inflation, there are a couple of open questions:  &gt; * How big will the impact be?  &gt; * How long will the impact last?  &gt; These are unknown currently. Which means future policy is also unknown.  &gt; Fed officials expect to take rates to 5.1%, i.e., one more rate increase. And then expect to hold it there through the end of the year. In short, they don‚Äôt expect rate cuts this year.  &gt; Yet investors expect no more rate increases and about 0.6% of rate cuts in the second half of 2023. Markets expect the policy rate in June to be at 4.8%, while expectations for December are at 4.2%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-implied-policy-rate-differential-600x800.png))**  &gt; There‚Äôs clearly a huge gulf between what the Fed expects versus what investors expect. This will have to reconcile in one of two ways:  &gt; * Market expectations move higher ‚Äì if economic/inflation data remain strong and credit conditions don‚Äôt look to be tightening significantly.  &gt; * Fed expectations move lower ‚Äì if the banking sector comes under renewed stress, credit conditions could tighten significantly and eventually lead to weaker data.  &gt; Things are obviously not going to go in either direction in a straight line. It‚Äôs going to be a bumpy ride as new data points come in, not to mention news/rumors of renewed problems in the banking sector.  *****  &gt; # Seasonality Keeps Claims Below 200K?  &gt; Initial jobless claims remained healthy this week with another sub-200K print. Claims fell modestly to 191K from last week's unrevised reading of 192K. That small decline exceeded expectations of claims rising up to 197K. Given claims continue to impress, the seasonally adjusted number has come in below 200K for 9 of the last 10 weeks. By that measure, it has been the strongest stretch for claims since last April when there were 10 weeks in a row of sub-200K prints. Prior to that, from 2018 through 2020 the late March and early April period similarly saw consistent readings under 200K meaning that some of the strength in the adjusted number could be on account of residual seasonality.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-1.png))**  &gt; In fact, this point of the year has some of the weeks in which claims have the most consistently historically fallen week over week. Taking a historical median of claims throughout the year, claims tend to round out a short-term bottom in the spring before an early summer bump. In other words, seasonal strength will begin to wane in the coming months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-2.png))**  &gt; While initial claims improved, continuing claims worsened rising to 1.694 million from 1.68 million the previous week. Albeit higher, that remains below the 2023 high of 1.715 million set at the end of February.  *****  &gt; # A Fed Day Like Most Others  &gt; Yesterday's Fed decision and comments from Fed Chair Powell gave markets plenty to chew on. As we discussed in last night's Closer and today's Morning Lineup, there have been a number of conflicting statements from officials and confusing reactions in various assets over the past 24 hours. In spite of all that uncertainty, the S&amp;P 500's path yesterday pretty much followed the usual script. In the charts below we show the S&amp;P's average intraday pattern across all Fed days since Powell has been chair (first chart) and the intraday chart of the S&amp;P yesterday (second chart). As shown, the market's pattern yesterday, especially after the 2 PM ET rate decision and the 2:30 PM press conference, closely resembled the average path that the market has followed across all Powell Fed Days since 2018.  &gt; The S&amp;P saw a modest bounce after the 2 PM Fed decision and then a further rally right after Powell's presser began at 2:30 PM. That initial post-presser spike proved to be a pump-fake, as markets ultimately sold off hard with a near 2% decline from 2:30 PM to the 4 PM close.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-1a.png))**  &gt; So what typically happens in the week after Fed days? Since 1994 when the Fed began announcing policy decisions on the same day as its meeting, the S&amp;P has averaged a decline of 10 basis points over the next week. During the current tightening cycle that began about a year ago, market performance in the week after Fed days has been even worse with the S&amp;P averaging a decline of 0.99%. However, when the S&amp;P has been down over 1% on Fed days (like yesterday), performance over the next week has been positive with an average gain of 0.64%. As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-3.png))**  *****   &gt; # What Now? An Update on Recent Bank Stress.  &gt; It‚Äôs been less than 2 weeks since Silicon Valley Bank‚Äôs stunning 48-hour collapse, and a few more banks have been caught in the fray. New York regulators closed the doors on Signature Bank on Sunday, March 12. A week later, US banks injected $30 billion into First Republic Bank to keep it afloat, and UBS acquired rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse in a government-brokered deal. In the midst of the chaos, your Carson Investment Research team was there for you with client-facing content, professional advice, and investment solutions. In fact, we think this event presents an opportunity to invest in the more stable large-cap financial companies and recently upgraded the sector to overweight in our House Views Advice.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mar22_1-1600x927.png))**  &gt; # Why is this happening? &gt; The rapid hike in interest rates caused an asset and liability mismatch for banks. Due to many years of low-interest rates, banks invested assets in interest-earning loans and bonds that would be repaid over the next five-plus years, which at the time was a logical way to earn a higher yield. Regulators considered government bonds to be among the safest ways a bank could invest its capital. As interest rates rose, bond values dropped. Interest rates rose at the fastest pace in history, and the safe assets that banks invested in lost value to the tune of more than $620 billion in unrealized losses as of the end of last year. This decline in value left weaker banks underwater and, when coupled with depositors pulling money out, caused them to collapse or seek costly capital raises.  &gt; # Why this matters to investors? &gt; The weakness in the banking sector will likely lead to tighter lending standards, potentially slowing economic growth. The reason we‚Äôre in this mess, to begin with, is that the Fed hiked interest rates to slow the economy because inflation was rising too quickly. Perhaps the 16% drop in oil prices over the past two weeks reflected this slower growth and bodes well for continued falling inflation. Thus, the Fed is closer to achieving its goal.  &gt; Maybe it‚Äôs an overreaction as ‚Äúbanking crisis‚Äù headlines stir painful memories of 2008. Either way, an environment with slower growth and lower inflation isn‚Äôt a bad time to invest. Bonds and stocks could both perform well, especially stocks of companies with the ability to grow earnings. We also reiterate our House Views Advice overweight on the large-cap Financials sector. The largest US banks are well-capitalized and are gaining market share from the smaller regional banks. We believe this calamity provides an opportunity for stronger banks and investors to capitalize on.  *****  &gt; # FANG+ Flying  &gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup, sector performance has heavily favored areas like Tech, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services in recent weeks. Playing into that sector level performance has been the strength of the mega-caps. The NYSE FANG+ index tracks ten of the largest and most highly traded Tech and Tech-adjacent names. In the past several days, that cohort of stocks is breaking out to the highest level since last April whereas the S&amp;P 500 still needs to rally 4% to reach its February high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-1.png))**  &gt; Although FANG+ stocks have been strong recently, that follows more than a full year of underperformance. As shown below, relative to the S&amp;P 500, mega-cap Tech consistently underperformed from February 2021 through this past fall. In the past few days, the massive outperformance has resulted in a breakout of the downtrend for the ratio of FANG+ to the S&amp;P 500.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-2.png))**  &gt; More impressive is how rapid of a move it has been for that ratio to break out. Below, we show the 2-month percent change in the ratio above. As of the high at yesterday's close, the ratio had risen 22.5% over the prior two months. That comes up just short of the record (22.6%) leading up to the pre-COVID high in February 2020. In other words, mega-cap Tech has experienced near-record outperformance relative to the broader market. However, we would note that this is in the wake of last year when the group had seen some of its worst two-month underperformance on record with the worst readings being in March, May, and November.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # March Seasonality Prevails, Banking Fiasco Be Damned  &gt; It‚Äôs encouraging typical March seasonal patterns have overcome recent bank failures, recession talk and fearmongering. The early March pullback was steeper than normal, but the usual mid-month rebound appears to be materializing.  &gt; Last week‚Äôs gains could be an indication we have seen the worst of the banking fallout and the end of the pullback. Triple Witching Weeks have tended to be down in flat periods and dramatically so during bear markets. Positive March Triple Witching weeks in 2003 and 2009 confirmed the market was back in rally mode.  &gt; The week after March Triple Witching is notoriously nasty. S&amp;P is down 27 of the last 40 year ‚Äì and frequently down sharply. Positive or flat action this week would be constructive.  &gt; In the old days March used to come in like a bull and out like a bear. Nowadays March has evolved into an inflection point where short-term trends often change course. The market is clearly at an important juncture and it‚Äôs a good time to remember Warren Buffet‚Äôs wise words to ‚ÄúBe greedy when others are fearful.‚Äù  &gt; Bank failures are never a good thing, but the swift actions of regulators likely prevented further damage to the industry. At the least, the banks are likely to be under even greater scrutiny going forward. In the near-term we expect more volatile trading. Further out we expect the market, and the economy will recover like they both have historically done.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5fe6f3377343f819ff93c97e8aeb8ffc/1258a39f06bd18c7-63/s500x750/303b38d927e1a424f5dc254dd086678978f2cc12.jpg))**  *****  &gt; # Nasdaq Leaves the S&amp;P in the Dust  &gt; Looking at the major US index ETF screen of our Trend Analyzer shows just how disconnected the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has become from other major index ETFs recently. As shown below, as of Friday's close, QQQ actually finished in overbought territory (over 1 standard above its 50-DMA) whereas many other major index ETFs were oversold, some of those to an extreme degree. On a year to date basis, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has rallied more than 14% compared to low single digit gains or losses for the rest of the pack.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/usindexqqq.png))**  &gt; Historically, the major indices, namely the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, tend to trade at similar overbought and oversold levels. In the chart below we show the Nasdaq 100 and S&amp;P 500's distance from their 50-DMAs (expressed in standard deviations) over the past five years. As shown, typically the two large cap indices have seen similar albeit not identical readings. That is until the past few weeks in which the two have diverged more significantly.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**  &gt; On Friday there was more than 2 standard deviations between the Nasdaq's overbought 50-DMA spread and the S&amp;P 500's oversold spread. As shown in the chart below, that surpassed recent highs in the spread like the spring of 2020 to set the highest reading since October 2016.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**  &gt; Going back to 1985, the spread between the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 50-DMA spreads diverging to such a degree is not without precedent, but it is also not exactly common. Friday marked the 16th time that spread eclipsed 2 standard deviations for the first time in at least 3 months. Relative to those prior instances, the current overbought and oversold readings in both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are relatively middling. However, only the instance in early 2000 similarly saw the Nasdaq technically overbought (trading at least a standard deviation above its 50-DMA) while the S&amp;P 500 was simultaneously oversold (at least one standard deviation below its 50-DMA).  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 24th, 2023**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JnEIcSYZEM))**  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3/26/23**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; (*$CCL $BNTX $LULU $MU $IZEA $SKLZ $WBA $HTHT $FUTU $LOVE $RH $PAYX $IHS $GOEV $CALM $PLAY $RUM $CTAS $CNM $MKC $BB $EVGO $VERO $AUGX $RGF $GMDA $SNX $RAIL $AEHR $PVH $SRT $UGRO $AADI $PRGS $DNMR $NEOG $CONN $IMBI $SOL $LOV $GROY $EE $ABOS $CNXC $UNF $AMPS $JEF $ESLT $CURI $DARE*)  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/mconM20.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/B9lJ6yg.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/kQxLMVP.png))**  *****  &gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).  &gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))  *****  # DISCUSS!

[$NVDA pump or bust??,;,; I would like to know everyone's opinion on this. I think even though $NVDA has like 4xed in the past year or so that they could absolutely destroy earnings and see another 10-30% gain. I am doing general research to see if I am correct but I have seen multiple articles stating how the demand for Nvidas products has increased so much that they can't make them fast enough. In this case I am speaking more to the AI compute devices although regular GPU's could share this fact. Over the past couple quarters they have seen greater %gains each time, Q4 of 14% and Q1 24 of 25%. Most of this is attributed to the recent ChatGPT boom although overall this year has been noticeably different in terms of ai hype.

[Can anyone help me explain NVDA?,;,; Hi,  I understand the top performance of the stock, their product innovation and quality, but this thing seems a bit over the top.  I'm modeling a revenue growth of 25% next year, and 20% p.a. for the next 4, which converges to a riskfree rate after that and reaches a massive $190B in sales in 10 years.   I even bump up the margins at 52% in that period, giving me an operating income of $103B in 10 years (this puts the company on par with what AAPL and MSFT make today), and is something that no hardware company makes close to - Yes, I'm aware its not 100% hardware because of CUDA.  Finally, after all is subtracted, I model a bottom line of $38B as free cash flows in year 10.  Here's the table, read it left to right as we go from the revenue to the free cash flows:  [NVDA Valuation Table](https://preview.redd.it/ypz0mex79wbc1.png?width=783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d387889d4200b37aa70ee9a65def3f1a6b39159)  And still, I get an intrinsic value of the company around $650B, a good +50% lower than the $1.4T at which NVDA trades today.

[Is Nvidia Overvalued? AVGO Boasts 62% Higher Net Income than NVDA, Yet with a 65% Lower Market Cap?,;,; In the rapidly evolving world of technology, NVIDIA has emerged as a leading player in the semiconductor industry. Known for its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, the company has garnered significant attention from investors. However, in the current economic environment, there are growing concerns that NVIDIA‚Äôs stock may be overvalued. This article delves into various factors, including economic indicators, company fundamentals and comparable examples , to provide a comprehensive analysis of why NVIDIA‚Äôs stock valuation may be inflated.   As a cyclical stock, the global economy plays a crucial role in determining the performance and valuation of a company like NVIDIA. Considering economic indicators such as GDP growth rates showing signs of moderation, reflecting a potential slowdown in overall economic activity. Additionally, inflationary pressures and interest rate adjustments have introduced uncertainties into the market. These factors can impact investor sentiment and the valuation of companies, including NVIDIA.  To evaluate NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation, we need to examine its fundamental aspects. The company‚Äôs financial profile reveals key information:  Examining NVIDIA‚Äôs quarterly income statement reveals a mix of sales growth and decline over the past five quarters. The most recent quarter, ending on April 30, 2023, saw a substantial increase in sales with a growth rate of 18.86%. However, the preceding quarters experienced more varied results, including modest growth, a decline, and a significant drop in sales.  These fluctuations in sales growth suggest that NVIDIA‚Äôs revenue stream may not be consistently expanding. Such volatility can impact the company‚Äôs overall valuation, especially when combined with the high P/E ratio of 219.84 mentioned earlier. Investors should be cautious when evaluating the stock‚Äôs current valuation, considering the mixed performance shown in the income statement.  	1.	Market Capitalization: NVIDIA‚Äôs market cap stands at a staggering $1.04 trillion, highlighting its prominence in the market. However, a high market cap alone does not guarantee that a stock is fairly valued. 	2.	Earnings Per Share (EPS): NVIDIA‚Äôs EPS for the most recent fiscal year was reported at $1.92. While this figure appears solid, a deeper analysis is necessary to assess its significance in relation to the stock‚Äôs valuation. 	3.	Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: The P/E ratio for NVIDIA is an eye-opening 219.84, indicating a substantial premium investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. A high P/E ratio could suggest overvaluation if not adequately supported by other factors.  To assess NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation further, it is prudent to compare the company‚Äôs financial indicators to those of its competitors within the semiconductor sector, namely AMD, Micron, and AVGO.  AMD, with an EPS of 0.24 and a market capitalization of $183.44 billion, exhibits a notably lower valuation compared to NVIDIA. However, the semiconductor industry‚Äôs current fame and widespread recognition may contribute to inflated valuations across the sector.  Micron‚Äôs negative EPS of -2.68 and market capitalization of $69.12 billion indicate weaker financial performance when compared to NVIDIA and AMD. As a result, Micron may not serve as an accurate benchmark for evaluating NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation.  AVGO, another prominent player in the semiconductor sector, boasts a healthy EPS of 31.64 and a P/E ratio of 27.41. With a market capitalization of $357.98 billion, AVGO appears to be favorably valued relative to its earnings, further highlighting the need for careful evaluation within the semiconductor sector.  Comparing AVGO‚Äôs Annual Income Statement with NVDA‚Äôs provides valuable insights into the financial performance of both companies:  AVGO Annual Income Statement:  	‚Ä¢	2022 Sales/Revenue: $33,203 million 	‚Ä¢	2022 Net Income: $11,495 million  NVDA Annual Income Statement:  	‚Ä¢	2023 Sales/Revenue: $26,974 million 	‚Ä¢	2023 Net Income: $4,368 million  Looking at the revenue figures, AVGO has consistently shown higher sales/revenue over the past five years. In 2022, AVGO reported sales of $33,203 million, while NVDA reported sales of $26,974 million.  In terms of net income, AVGO has also demonstrated strong performance. In 2022, AVGO reported a net income of $11,495 million, indicating robust profitability. On the other hand, NVDA reported a net income of $4,368 million in 2023, which is notably lower than AVGO‚Äôs net income.  These figures suggest that AVGO has consistently outperformed NVDA in terms of both revenue and net income. The higher revenue and stronger profitability of AVGO further reinforce the argument that NVIDIA may be overvalued when compared to AVGO.  Taking into account the prevailing economic challenges and the potential impact on the semiconductor sector, there are indications that NVIDIA‚Äôs current valuation may be inflated. The semiconductor industry, including NVIDIA, has gained significant attention due to its critical role in emerging technologies and the ongoing digital revolution. However, widespread recognition and market enthusiasm can contribute to elevated valuations.  Given the factors discussed above, including the mixed sales growth, high P/E ratio, and comparisons to industry peers, there is a compelling case to suggest that NVIDIA‚Äôs stock may experience a sharp price decline in the near future. The current economic environment, with signs of a slowdown in overall economic activity and uncertainties surrounding inflation and interest rates, adds further weight to this analysis.  While the company‚Äôs prominence in the semiconductor industry is undeniable, the potential for overvaluation cannot be overlooked. The market cap of $1.04 trillion alone does not guarantee fair valuation, and the EPS and P/E ratio indicate a premium investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.  While the stock has enjoyed significant attention and growth, there are indications that it is overvalued. In conclusion, it is crucial for investors to assess NVIDIA‚Äôs stock valuation critically, taking into account the economic landscape, company fundamentals, and industry trends.,;,; 2023-07-02 15:37:57]

[Nvidia $NVDA rises, here is why -,;,; Nvidia $NVDA intends to announce three new chips for China, weeks after the company was restricted by the U.S. from selling two high-end artificial intelligence chips and another top gaming chip to Chinese companies, Reuters reported citing local news outlet STAR Market Daily. Nvidia (NVDA) stock has risen about 2% at market open.  The chips are known as HGX H20, L20 PCIe and L2 PCIe and that the U.S. tech giant could announce them on Nov. 16 at the earliest, the media outlet said citing people with knowledge of the matter.  In October, the U.S. brought in new updates to its export restrictions which curbed the sale of chips that Nvidia (NVDA) made for the Chinese market, such as the A800 and H800 chips, as part of Washington's efforts aimed at hindering China's access to advanced semiconductor technology. Last year, the U.S. imposed rules restricting Nvidia from selling its A100 and H100 chips to China, after which the company had come up with A800 and H800 chips as alternatives for the Chinese market.

Basically gives you an understanding of when we start going into oversold or overbought territories.  1. This is much more useful for index-related products like qqq/spy/iwm/dia because they're likely to see less volatility in relation to individual tickers. 2. With earnings, market participants are placing more options-related bets causing implied volatility to go higher, so this expected move information can help dictate the range in which a stock moves. Obviously, if there are unexpected poison pills in an earnings report or if there are unexpected positive catalysts, you can move outside the deviations. 3. it's expected that 70% of the time we fall within the range by the end of the week/month/quarter. So this means that when we are hitting the upper and lower bounds of this data, we can see oversold or overbought conditions. Now here's where you can pair it together with another tool called RSI. Most people are familiar with RSI. If we break out of the upper expected moves on already high RSI, this can create favorable short setups where you do have probabilities on your side. Now keep in mind point 1 &amp; 2 that I made. You can have overbought + high RSI on individual tickers like MSFT and NVDA because of something that may fundamentally change the company like a new revenue stream. Hence why this is more useful on index-related products. 4. At the end of the day, this is all a game of probability. When you are oversold on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the upside. When you are overbought on RSI, and you're several deviations outside the expected move, probability favors the downside.,;,; 2023-05-21 00:45:55]

They are now ready to challenge NVDA‚Äôs dominance in terms of computing power and offer a more diverse investment opportunity in the semiconductor market.  Overvaluation Concerns and Market Perception: The buzz surrounding NVDA‚Äôs achievements has led to concerns of overvaluation as investors rush to invest in what was once considered the primary AI play. The stock‚Äôs valuation has skyrocketed, raising questions about its sustainability. However, market perceptions are shifting, driven by the emergence of data centers as a compelling alternative. Savvy investors are recognizing the potential benefits of diversifying their portfolios and exploring opportunities beyond NVDA, which could protect them from the risks associated with an overvalued stock.  The Shift in Market Dynamics: The financial landscape is dynamic and ever-evolving, with market sentiment and trends constantly shifting. The growing recognition of data centers as a powerful alternative to NVDA signals a potential turning point in the AI market. As the market becomes saturated with NVDA investments, the demand for alternative investment opportunities is expected to surge.  Blackstone‚Äôs Strategic Focus: Notably, Blackstone, a prominent player in the investment landscape, has already made a decisive move in favor of data centers. Recognizing the changing and highly competitive nature of the semiconductor sector, Blackstone has chosen to prioritize investments in data centers. This strategic shift underscores their confidence and foresight, as they find valuations more favorable and growth more prominent in the data center market.  Investing in Data Centers: A Viable Strategy? Given the increasing competitiveness of data centers, investors seeking exposure to the AI market may find it wise to explore this emerging sector. Data centers provide a robust and diversified approach, offering access to a range of companies harnessing AI capabilities. By investing in data centers, individuals can capitalize on the growing demand for AI-driven computing power while mitigating the risks associated with NVDA‚Äôs vulnerabilities and potential overvaluation.  Conclusion: The dominance of NVDA in the AI market is no longer assured, as data centers rise to prominence and challenge its position. While NVDA has undoubtedly been at the forefront of AI advancements, the emergence of data centers as a formidable alternative cannot be ignored. Investors are increasingly recognizing the value of diversifying their portfolios and exploring alternative opportunities beyond NVDA‚Äôs potential overvaluation. Wall Street is awakening to the vulnerabilities of NVDA and the immense potential of data centers, which are poised to reshape the investment landscape and provide a broader array of opportunities in the AI market. Blackstone‚Äôs strategic focus on data centers further solidifies their importance in the shifting technological landscape.,;,; 2023-07-17 15:59:44]

[Stocks always lose money - how do you stay invested?,;,; &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/kdsc3xhh25ka1.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f73d8f1bb36f730e50e5124cce88af2388beef1  Investing in the stock market is a long-term game that requires patience and discipline. One of the most important lessons any investor can learn is to stay invested, even during market downturns. It can be tempting to sell off your investments and sit on the sidelines when the market takes a hit, but this is often the worst thing you can do. Instead, it's crucial to stay the course and stick to your investment strategy.  History has shown that the stock market is cyclical, and downturns are a natural part of the cycle. While it can be painful to see your investments lose value, it's important to remember that these downturns are typically short-lived. In fact, many of the most significant market gains have occurred in the years following a market crash. By staying invested, you give yourself the opportunity to benefit from these gains and achieve your long-term financial goals.  Attempting to time the market is notoriously difficult, even for the most experienced investors. Studies have shown that most investors who try to time the market end up missing out on some of the best-performing days, which can have a significant impact on their long-term returns. By staying invested, you avoid the temptation to try to time the market and can benefit from the long-term upward trend of the stock market. So, resist the urge to sell off your investments during market downturns and stay focused on your long-term goals.   **How do you stay invested?**  Defined outcome option trades can be an effective tool for investors looking to stay invested while limiting their downside risk during market downturns. For example, suppose an investor holds a portfolio of blue-chip stocks and is concerned about a potential market downturn. They could consider using options to limit their potential losses while staying invested in the market.   Take this example on NVDA. Holding a ratio spread (call spread funded by short put) can make up to 4% (11% annualized) AND provide downside protection. Only start to lose only if NVDA falls by more than to below $150.50 (34% drop from current prices) at maturity (in this case 7/21/2023**)**.  [Outcome if NVDA rallies to $243](https://preview.redd.it/ljc42w5x55ka1.png?width=1788&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a2890ff012013feb691b4d17f80e883cc14bd0b)  [Outcome if NVDA drops to $157.50](https://preview.redd.it/j3cl1tby55ka1.png?width=1793&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4f985d25f0fe1a188f4595ddf333c35ceef62bf8)  With defined outcome options you can protect yourself from sudden drops in value for a limited time by agreeing to limit your potential gains on a specific date. This is guaranteed by the exchange. This approach can be an effective way to manage risk while staying invested in the stock market over the long term.,;,; 2023-02-24 13:57:39]

[Nvidia, AMD stocks fall on report of new AI chip bans from Biden administration,;,; Shares of Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. slumped in the extended session Tuesday following a report that the Biden administration is considering a new ban on sales of AI chips to China.  Nvidia shares NVDA,A fell 3% after hours, following a 3.1% gain to close at $418.76, while AMD shares AMD, also fell 3%, after a 2.7% gain in the regular session to close at $110.39.  Late Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported the Commerce Department could further block sales of AI chips to China unless U.S. companies first obtain a special license.  The ban would follow upon similar actions last year that threatened $400 million in Nvidia sales, but the company found a workaround in supplying a version of products that avoided the ban.

[Nvidia CTO: Cryptocurrency has little value, AI is the future!,;,; Cryptocurrency mining demand has driven [Nvidia](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-NVDA/)'s GPU chip sales. However, Michael Kagan, [Nvidia](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-NVDA/)'s chief technology officer, sent a different signal in a recent interview.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/kli5k7pqvgqa1.png?width=691&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef84a896b284e8ae9877d22e51b71864107cc52a  Kagan points out that cryptocurrency miners buy a lot of [Nvidia](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-NVDA/) hardware, but cryptocurrencies don't add anything useful to society, which is why the crypto market has crashed so often recently.  By contrast, he prefers AI (artificial intelligence) because it is good for society. Artificial intelligence allows individuals to create custom programs to meet different needs. But the high-frequency trading of cryptocurrencies doesn't actually mean anything to humans.  He therefore suggests that the same processor chips used to mine cryptocurrencies be used to create chatbots, such as ChatGPT, that add more value to society.  **Cryptocurrency mania fades**  GPUs are a great tool for cryptocurrency mining. During the crypto boom of 2020 and 2021, "miners" snapped up Nvidia GPUs in a frenzy. The price of GPUs had been on an upward trend due to higher demand.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/t0bdrinrvgqa1.png?width=436&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4310de12521b68afba0a64df3490bb0b491eadc0  That has also helped drive solid growth in Nvidia's GPU business. But that didn't last long. With cryptocurrency prices plummeting at a rapid rate, miners' profits were falling, and Nvidia's GPU business slowed.  According to Jon Peddie Research, Nvidia, Intel and AMD shipped 6.9 million individual GPUs in the third quarter of 2022, down 42% from the same period in 2021 and the lowest number of units shipped since the report began.  Nvidia, meanwhile, reported a 17% year-over-year drop in revenue and a 72% year-over-year drop in net income in the third quarter, with gaming graphics and visualization revenues down more than 50%. By Nvidia's own account, declining GPU sales are a big part of the reason.  **AI takes over**  Kagan points out that the failure of cryptocurrencies is not surprising. He pointed out that, apart from speculation, the crypto industry doesn't have any real-world examples.  Not so with artificial intelligence. He points out that since ChatGPT was released, AI has been front and center, and more and more application scenarios have been developed.  [Nvidia](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-NVDA/) CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is also betting big on AI. He said the emergence of new chatbots such as ChatGPT was an "iPhone moment" in artificial intelligence. He expects artificial intelligence to flourish and lead Nvidia to high sales and high growth again.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/dxuzwycsvgqa1.png?width=692&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=543dacd7a977a1429719d7076cd91f8eead7294c  [Nvidia](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-NVDA/) has indeed made a foray into AI, recently unveiling a cloud-based AI supercomputer that users can access through a desktop browser.

[Epic V Continues to Show How Little Risk Exists,;,; CPI came in hot, the market doesn't care. NVDA has been pumping all week. MSFT is pumping like crazy too. We saw last week (first week of 2024) a pullback for the first time in a while, but it was instantly wiped out, by you guessed it! Another V!  That's what this market does. There is an answer for every red candle.  Prior to this 0DTE/ free money, endless liquidity world, you would get profit taking. A drop might cause some investors to be concerned and that could lead to  a pullback, but in 2024 (similar to 2023) every single dip is seen as a buying opportunity no matter what. You just buy every dip and you know you can't possibly lose.  I've obviously posted this before, but what is more amazing to me is that as time moves on, the market gets even more unstoppable. More and more are seeing first hand, the new phenomenon in the market. Like we have a low risk market, where something like QQQ is free money.  For those that want to challenge this, again how does it ever stop, when every dip meets an instant V.?

[Are they risky, really?,;,; So I‚Äôve been looking at a couple ETF‚Äôs and while both of them are leveraged, I can‚Äôt seem to find a downside. BULZ and SOXL seem like solid options with very little downside.   BULZ was new as of 2021 and started rocky and crashed all through 2022. Then 2023 it skyrocketed from $20 to the $136 it‚Äôs at now. It‚Äôs tech related and I don‚Äôt see tech crashing anytime soon.   SOXL is a semiconductor ETF that started as a little penny stock in 2010(I think) and has worked its way up over $39.

[Where does a stocks value and price come from, what truly drives the prices up and down?,;,; So I have been scouring the internet for the past couple of weeks, trying to figure out how exactly a stocks price is determined. What I came up with is that a stocks price is determined by buying and selling pressures from the stocks holders. Which makes sense at the surface. What I want to know is how does a companies performance help determine that price, and it seems that investors are willing to trade at a certain price based on a companies earnings, profitability, etc...   The way I understand everything I have read, a company issues common stock during it's IPO, common stock does not really give you a true ownership of the company. Yes, they say you get voting rights for the board of directors and a say in policy and such, but really the preferred stock holders are the true kings of this territory. Furthermore, if the company goes belly-up your ownership of the company just disappears, you won't see a dime in a majority of cases. That being said it seems that the company takes all it's liquid capital during the IPO, and during subsequent offerings or stock selloffs.   So that leads me to my concerns and my questions, what am I getting wrong here? It seems like common stock is just really worthless at face value, only propped up by other "investors" pouring their money into the stock by buying, and others taking money out by selling. All it is, is a way for investors to trade cash back and fourth? When I buy a stock, I am buying from other people, not the company, the company isn't getting any of that money, it just sits in escrow until someone else sells their shares and takes my money.   This brings me to the crux of my potential misunderstanding, when a company is making a profit, does that profit get infused into the stock at some point, bringing the value up? Or is the price really just determined by a bunch of people just throwing cash around, deciding to buy or sell on a whim, based on arbitrary metrics?,;,; 2023-10-22 16:08:32]

[Why you're all wrong about AI being a bubble and can't see it because you're all too hurt from the money you all lost falling for the other fake bubbles,;,;  I know a lot of people are going to boo me for this, but the AI hype is real. Sure, there are shysters and garbage companies out there ~~paying lawyers~~ using Chat GPT to draw up the paperwork to go public and fleece the greedy and the ignorant. But the changes AI is bringing to the world are going to be more bigger, more fundamentally daily life changing, and faster than all the changes that happened during the Information Age.     The real key to understanding what a watershed moment Chat GPT and other generative AI technology out there to the general public is this:     The information age brought about **sharing information** at 0 marginal cost.      The AI age is bringing about **generation of knowledge** at 0 marginal cost.     Go ahead and tell me, "AI can't do anything, it can only rearrange things." or "Yeah, but it isn't 100% right all the time." First, that's what humans do. Second, when are humans 100% right all the time anyway? Whether or not AI is generating original information doesn't really belong in this sub. But **it is uncontestable that AI can generate new information right now.**   Over time, AI will get better and genuinely produce new knowledge. But the producing of new knowledge isn't the earth shattering part. I can go out and make a baby with someone and essentially create a new data processing machine. The revolutionary part, **the truly revolutionary part is that you can build these machine minds to solve problems for you at scale.**  Go listen to the $NVDA call and you'll hear NVDA explain that businesses are buying chips to build out these scalable machine brains. Remember all those conference calls where companies were saying "AI" on their calls to get a stock price boost?  Was some of it nonsense? Yes.  However, **we're about an earnings season or two away from one of those companies who said they were using new AI tech to improve their business to announce that it actually worked.** There is going to be one company, the first company that goes on their earnings call and says "Due to AI we have unexpectedly high profits and are raising full year guidance."   **That will be the tipping point, and it is as few as 3 months away.**  I'm not going to sit here and pretend to know which company is going to make that announcement. I don't. Nor do I have the time to sift through enough earnings calls to figure it out, though I wish I did. It's going to be a company with obvious uses for AI, and probably more focused on a company who that uses lots of brainpower like an engineering or coding company. Possibly something in the service sector.  The moment corporate America figures out how to do significantly more with significantly less labor by using AI, it will. And GDP is going to explode.  There have been so many ideas and "revolutions" that were going to change everything. They all promised that change was just around the corner.      The AI boom is different. It is the real deal, and we're going to see an economic and stock market bonanza that will likely never be repeated in our lifetimes.,;,; 2023-05-27 20:23:23]

Am I gonna make it,;,; As a major lurker, I‚Äôve seen quite a few of these ‚ÄúTrading journey‚Äù posts and I decided that I might as well jump in the fire with my very own take.  The weather is just about brewing with enough chaos that we might see a decent tailwind across AI stocks within the next few months. I intend to ride the hypecycle with a an automated AI strategy to capture as much upside value as possible.  **A few things that make me believe the AI hype cycle is just getting started:**  **The Fed‚Äôning**  * Government expenditure in relation to GDP will continue to increase This isn‚Äôt just a US phenomena, Nation states worldwide are increasing government expediture and reach.(Chipps act, various AI accessibility and regulatory acts). A good portion of this will trickle down into the market cap of bluechip co‚Äôs with big AI departments ready for big ol entreprise contracts.  **The upcoming major IOT adoption via regulatory enforcement**  * On this, I can single out an event that most people are sleeping on. The US food supply chain is about to undergo massive digital transformation with FSMA (The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act ). Think big data lakes and lots of machine learning having to be adopted at gunpoint in unseen rates all across the food supply chain.  **Upstream/Downstream innovation in private markets**  * AI tech has been commoditized, can be forked, API called, build on top of. Its pretty fluid and easy to access. As I type this, there‚Äôs tens of thousands of AI startups across all imaginable industries getting past product-market-fit hurdles, opening distribution channels, and ultimately expanding the AI global total addressable market . This early stage innovation will trickle down into public markets in record time. Wait a few months.  **My AI investment strategy - AI investing in AI (kinda ‚Äúquirky‚Äù huh?)**  To create my strategy I asked an AI tool ‚ÄúCan you create a momentum trading strategy focused on AI-focused stocks?‚Äù     &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/agv4ngxvjzcb1.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5f4106905719facc3e078dbf048f78a490755b13  The AI-created strategy was interesting but I then made some tweaks based on the basket of AI stocks I wanted to include in this momentum trading approach. I removed IBM (as I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be a key beneficiary or leader in the AI race), and added PLTR (for defence/government AI exposure), TSM (for some semiconductor exposure) and META (this is a questionable one but the open source models that their research team have created our world-class and I don‚Äôt want to bet against Zuck).

This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings:  https://preview.redd.it/evtbd2dnkgec1.png?width=654&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=47c5c6d9f58e6997aad5330dba32ff543e2c8541  Data Sources:  * SPY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/spy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Schwab](https://www.schwab.wallst.com/schwab/Prospect/research/etfs/schwabETF/index.asp?type=holdings&amp;symbol=SPY)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/?guccounter=1)‚Äã‚Äã. $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST)‚Äã * SFY Holdings: [Stock Analysis](https://stockanalysis.com/etf/sfy/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã, [Zacks.com](https://www.zacks.com/funds/etf/SFY/holding)‚Äã‚Äã, [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SFY/holdings/)‚Äã‚Äã. $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST)  **Key Observations:**  * Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. * Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. * Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.  It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.  I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:  1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. 2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&amp;P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. 3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. 4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. 5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. 6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.  It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.  **What are your thoughts?**,;,; 2024-01-24 21:46:21]

At its peak in 2000, the company was valued at $200 billion. By 2001, the stock price had dropped by 80% and Oracle bought Sun for $7B in 2010.

[Why Are Analysts Increasing NVIDIA‚Äôs Price Target? Is It Out of Fear That Something Bad Will Happen, Leading Them to Encourage Others to Buy for their own profits?,;,; NVIDIA, often considered the heart of AI stocks, has recently been in the spotlight as analysts uniformly raise their stock targets. To me, this trend seems somewhat peculiar, even considering the current earnings season. The buoyant optimism surrounding the stock‚Äôs potential rise is sparking doubt in my mind. Should the stock underperform, it will be a litmus test of these analysts‚Äô sincerity, raising questions about whether they may be manipulating public sentiment.  In the broader context of the semiconductor sector, the recent quarterly earnings have been largely underwhelming. Yet, all semiconductor stocks appear to be buoyed by NVIDIA‚Äôs momentum. A stumble in NVIDIA‚Äôs stock could trigger a broader tech market downfall, while success could reignite a bullish trend for tech stocks. My intuition, however, leans towards a potential disappointment. NVIDIA might surpass current estimates but simultaneously lower their future guidance due to sluggish growth. Should this occur, a significant drop in stock price could follow.  Disclaimer: These thoughts are purely my own observations and should not be taken as financial advice.,;,; 2023-08-17 04:33:15]

I have SO long until retirement and a pretty high risk tolerance. This money came from summer jobs + a small business which I had going on a bit ago. In the photo are my positions and their percentages; I am in need of really any advice you can give. For example, should I add more tech? Am I diversified? Do i need to dial it back a bit on the individual stocks? Thanks so much. I have a lot of learning to do.,;,; 2024-01-19 04:51:53]

He's 25, and it's more of a buy weekly/bi-weekly and come back in 3 - 5 years.  Picks:  * VOO - Tracks the performance of the 500 biggest US companies. * VUG - Tracks U.S. large-cap growth companies. It provides investors with diversified exposure to stocks of companies that are expected to have higher-than-average growth rates. * AAPL - Apple  * TD - Always good to have at least one bank for diversification * AMZN - Amazon  I know VOO and VUG overlap, especially with AAPL and AMZN, but I want him to have 2 primary ETFs and 3 to 4 stocks.

[Will Big Tech Slow Down At All? Why/How?,;,; I've got 9/15 $35 SQQQ Calls but I'm getting worried because big tech seems like a force of nature esp with the emergence of AI, it's like they're all on fucking steroids and a correction may be a tiny 5% pullback before it explodes into the stratosphere.  About a month or two ago I was fairly confident in a recession happening, but recently with new data coming out, it seems like there ain't gonna be a recession.   Strong labor market, inflation still sticky but it seems like a pause in June is certain which might mean there wont be any more rate hikes this year, and it seems like people who once thought a recession was coming in the 2nd half of the year and now saying either there ain't a recession coming or the odds of a recession are significantly lower than they use to be.  This is pure speculation but with the emergence of AI it feels like the magnificent 7 (MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, GOOG, META, NVDA, TSLA) is going to absolutely smash their next earnings calls in late July.   I'm really just looking for opinions on how and why big tech will see a decently sized correction in the near future because the way things look now, it's hard to fathom a big tech EVER slowing down.,;,; 2023-06-06 01:03:44]

[Histogram Insights on 1-15 Day Returns Across Various Assets,;,;  Numerous research papers typically focus on 1-day or 5-day returns when analyzing market trends. Curious about the broader picture, an extensive analysis was undertaken to plot and examine the return distributions for a range of 1 to 15 days. Conducted over a decade (2013-2024), this study delved into the daily return patterns of a variety of different tickers.  The findings are presented through a series of histograms, each corresponding to a different interval within the 1 to 15-day range, with the x-axis representing the percentage of return. These histograms display how frequently returns fall into various percentage brackets. Each histogram, representing an N-day return period, is organized into 1% bins. Green indicates positive returns, red signifies negative returns, and grey marks returns fluctuating between -0.5% and 0.5%. This color coding provides a nuanced perspective of market movements, and each chart also features a count of positive, negative, and near-zero returns for a quick trend assessment.  Taking $TSLA's 1-day return as an example, it was positive on 1196 days and negative on 1064 days. Over the past decade, holding $TSLA for just one day would have yielded a 52.9% probability of a profitable outcome. Contrastingly, extending the holding period to 15 days, with a positive-to-negative day ratio of 1521 to 1169, increases the likelihood of profit to about 56.54%. This also suggests the possibility for returns exceeding 100% over a 15-day period.  The consistent 1% bin width in the histograms for all tickers and N-day return periods facilitates a direct comparison of return distributions across different assets. This uniform approach allows for a clearer evaluation of volatility and return patterns, making it easier to assess and compare the performance characteristics of various investments.  Feedback on these findings and suggestions for further research are encouraged and appreciated.  P.S.: The tickers included in this analysis are "TSLA", "NVDA", "GME", "BABA", "SPY", "QQQ", "GLD", "XLE", "ARKK", "INDX:VIX", Bitcoin, and Ethereum.     &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/v3ultfg9ltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf0d01abe89c963c65db38db00fe30846a0409e1  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ghe6byzaltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03e6260458c76accc2cd92e9694ee3f0cd8bbda6  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/v1qwiwfcltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=24b9c4cb6280dd298cebf868d500f4a4fb400224  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/uucun7qdltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1d540c7a889d540e5fce932a03ccaefa2c43c97  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/b5uqdg0fltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbed2ea62a7a77e84ab43282c48f69f5556f6d2c  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/047go8ngltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7be62969e40b6f59a122e7e2d30eaa2893b53b5d  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/hvfp1c7kltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e6a17aebb5ff2246c8a9986cd418e71e134cf69  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/qmpnsp7lltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=50952d4a010b4346dd24bfa5f1ab538bf00fc2ef  https://preview.redd.it/3psqbl4iltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34c8388e1db76ff57f3fd00433d70e8f6fca8a91  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/cwco4e8mltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f908c2ec8986730cc11ba88836f4ce00c8f68cba  https://preview.redd.it/pyx14h8mltcc1.png?width=1500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7e05c50c5c7a935d56c4b48d93583c5fa00fc409,;,; 2024-01-16 15:26:44]

Founded in 1968, Intel‚Äôs contributions have been pivotal in the evolution of computing technologies. The company specializes in manufacturing microprocessors, chipsets, embedded processors, and network interface controllers, among others.  ### Intel‚Äôs Strategic Pivot Amidst Market Flux  Recent times have been a mix of challenges and opportunities for Intel. The company, once the undisputed leader in semiconductor technology, faces fierce competition from rivals like AMD and NVIDIA, who have made significant inroads into Intel‚Äôs market share. The rise of ARM-based processors and the increasing demand for specialized chips for AI and data centers add to the competitive pressure.  Intel‚Äôs response to these challenges has been multi-pronged. The company has accelerated its innovation cycle, focusing on next-generation chip technologies. Under the leadership of CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel announced a significant investment in expanding its manufacturing capabilities, aiming to not only meet its own chip demands but also offer foundry services to other chipmakers.  Moreover, Intel is actively diversifying its product portfolio. Its recent advancements in AI, edge computing, and autonomous driving technologies signify a strategic shift.¬†  Leading AI models, such as OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, predominantly utilize Nvidia GPUs hosted in cloud environments. This reliance has contributed to Nvidia‚Äôs stock soaring by approximately 230% since the beginning of the year, in stark contrast to Intel‚Äôs 68% increase. This trend underlines why competitors like AMD and Intel are now introducing their own chips, aiming to challenge Nvidia‚Äôs strong market presence.  Although specifics were sparse, Intel‚Äôs Gaudi3 is set to rival Nvidia‚Äôs H100, a popular choice for entities constructing extensive chip networks for AI operations, and AMD‚Äôs upcoming MI300X. The Gaudi3 is expected to begin distribution to clients in 2024.  However, these strategic decisions come with their own set of risks. The high cost of chip manufacturing and R&amp;D, coupled with the uncertain global economic landscape, poses significant challenges. The company‚Äôs ability to execute its ambitious plans while maintaining financial stability is a key factor to watch in the coming years.  ### Recent Financials:  Intel Corporation‚Äôs recent financial performance reflects the challenges and resilience of a tech giant in a volatile market. In Q3 2023, the company reported a total revenue of $14.2 billion, a decrease of 8% from the same quarter in the previous year. This decline was primarily due to decreases in revenue across its major segments: the Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue decreased by 3%, the Data Center and AI Group (DCAI) by 10%, and the Network and Edge Group (NEX) by a significant 32%.  The company‚Äôs financial strategy also reflects a commitment to operational efficiency and cost management. By streamlining processes and optimizing resources, Intel aims to improve its profitability and shareholder value in the long term. This approach is crucial as the company faces intense competition from other tech giants and emerging players in the semiconductor industry.  In conclusion, Intel‚Äôs recent financial performance, though marked by challenges, showcases the company‚Äôs strategic efforts to remain a dominant player in the tech industry. The company‚Äôs focus on innovation, operational efficiency, and market adaptability will be key to its future success and financial stability.  #### Financial Bullet Points:  * **Revenue (Q3 2023):** $14.2 billion, **down** 8% YoY. * **Client Computing Group Revenue:** **Decreased** by 3%. * **Data Center and AI Group Revenue:** **Decreased** by 10%. * **Network and Edge Group Revenue:** **Decreased** by 32%. * **Gross Margin (Q3 2023):** 42.5%, **slightly down** from 42.6% YoY. * **Net Income (Q3 2023):** $297 million, a **substantial decline** from $1.019 billion YoY. * **Earnings Per Share (Q3 2023):** $0.07, with non-GAAP EPS at $0.41.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/0yxuan2fgg6c1.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=528256a735b6b1088b9076cf8053d01466334e11  ### Business Model &amp; Competitors Analysis:  Intel‚Äôs business model revolves around its dominance in CPUs, with expansion into data center solutions, IoT, and AI. The company‚Äôs shift towards providing foundry services marks a strategic expansion of its business scope.  Competitors like AMD, NVIDIA, and ARM pose significant challenges. AMD‚Äôs gains in the CPU market and NVIDIA‚Äôs dominance in GPUs and AI chips have encroached on Intel‚Äôs turf. ARM‚Äôs energy-efficient architecture is increasingly favored for mobile devices and is making inroads into servers, a traditional Intel stronghold.  Intel‚Äôs response lies in its comprehensive product range, manufacturing capabilities, and R&amp;D investments. The company‚Äôs ability to innovate and adapt to market trends will be crucial in maintaining its competitive edge.  ### SWOT Analysis:  * **Strengths**: Strong brand, diverse product portfolio, manufacturing capabilities. * **Weaknesses**: Margin pressures, high competition, execution risks on strategic shifts. * **Opportunities**: Growth in AI, autonomous tech, and data centers. * **Threats**: Rapid technological changes, competitive market dynamics, global economic uncertainties.  ### Investment Outlook:  Intel‚Äôs future performance hinges on its ability to innovate and adapt to market trends. The company‚Äôs investment in AI and IoT, along with its strategic focus on foundry services, positions it well for future growth.  After conducting a comprehensive 10-year forecast, our analysis indicates that Intel‚Äôs current valuation appears to be justifiable, taking into account a range of scenarios. These scenarios are grounded in conservative (low), moderate (mid), and optimistic (high) financial assumptions, providing a robust framework for evaluating the company‚Äôs long-term potential.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/squ40h8ggg6c1.png?width=894&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8f6f2904b5930e27085da77b8147e50c4b9335c0  #### Concluding Remarks:  In conclusion, Intel Corporation stands at a pivotal point. Its strategic pivots, financial resilience, and commitment to innovation are commendable. Yet, the road ahead is fraught with challenges and competition. Intel‚Äôs journey will be a testament to its adaptability and resilience in an ever-evolving tech landscape. For investors, keeping a keen eye on Intel‚Äôs execution of its ambitious plans will be crucial in assessing its long-term potential in the dynamic semiconductor industry.,;,; 2023-12-15 12:50:05]

[Newbie to stocks - five general questions to help me understand,;,; Sorry beforehand: I'm a beginner at a lot within economics, but I truly want to learn and grasp the concepts. Stocks have always facinated me, but I really need the concepts to "click" in my mind so I truly understand them. And at this point, I'm very confused about what stocks truly are.  So I hope I can ask some questions, even if they're dumb! I'll try to make them short :) I'm also not English, so forgive me if some expressions are wrong.  1: A Stock is a ownership within a company, right? As far as I understand, when you start a company, you have your owners as the original investors, and when the company then gets onto the stock market, people buy "secondary stocks" or something? Basically they buy ownerships in your company, but not through your company directly, but rather people working at the stock market. Just want to know if I understand the very basics correctly  2: How exactly does a stock affect a company? If I buy stocks in a company, does that equal an investment, aka does that company get the money that I buy stocks with? And the same the other way: If I sell my stocks, does the company need to "buy me out" so to speak? If not, then how exactly does the stocks (their amount, their value, and how many are bought) affect the company itself? I thought that you can buy stocks to support a business you think will grow (and to earn money ofc), but if it doesn't directly benifit the company, then what's the deal?  3: I thought a price for a stock was depending on how well a company was doing; how much they've grown economically, grown by staff, how much money they have, how much debt they have, etc. But apparently, the price of a stock is purely dependent on demand from people? How is demand calculated? Is it how many people buy stocks in a set amount of time? Or is it that, when you buy, it's like a bidding round where the highest bidder gets to buy it (aka higher demand = more expensive)? How exactly is a stock's price determined? And if it is a bidding situation, does a stock ever even have a set price?  4: What's the benifits of having multiple stocks? I have no idea how many stocks exist per company and what prices are, but for the sake of simplicity, let's take an example. I buy a stock from a company for 1k dollars. Then the value of that stock increases by 100%, to 2k. That means I've invested 1k, and earned 1k in profit. Now, in another example, I buy 2 stocks from another company, each worth 500 dollars (I invest 1k in total). The value increases by 100%, making each worth 1k. In both examples, I invested 1k, and earned 1k in profit - the difference is that I had 1 stock in one company and 2 stocks in another. So if the % increase in value results in the same profit, then what's the benifit of owning more stocks?  5: Buying and selling. As I understand it, you can buy a stock at any time and sell it at any time. But I've also read that it's a bidding game (see my 3rd question), that there's a Bid and Ask system when selling (Bid being the highest someone is willing to buy for, and Ask being the lowest someone is willing to sell for). So what is it? If I can sell at any time, how can I be sure anyone will buy? Is selling guaranteed? How can I know what its value is? Is it that, I can sell at any time, but what I can sell it for depends on what people are willing to buy for at that specific time? If so, say I want to sell my stocks because I think its value will soon go down, right? But what if everyone else thinks it'll go down too, so no one wants to buy it? How exactly does this work?  &amp;#x200B;  6 (bonus question): How many stocks exist in a company? Is it the company that decides it? Can they have as many as they want to benifit their own stock value? Does that cost anything? ,;,; 2023-10-04 10:55:48]

[[Week 2] AI momentum trading journey guided by chat GPT/LLM. Feedback welcome,;,; This is a follow-up on my latest AI trading post where I laid out my short/mid term bullish case on the AI supply chain due to major upcoming disruption driven by policy and private/public markets. Those are:  1. **The Fed‚Äôning:** Major increase in government expenditure in relation to Global GDP that will trickle down into the AI economy. 2. **The upcoming major IOT adoption via regulatory enforcement:** FSMA food traceability act compliance deadline is fast approaching, Chipps Act, etc. 3. **Upstream/Downstream innovation in private markets:** Early stage capital has commoditized AI (APIs, et al.)  with billions of dollars of VC funding. This early stage innovation will trickle down  into public markets sooner that expected.  For those missing initial context, I‚Äôm using AI to invest in AI with automated investing strategies.  **How my AI Momentum Investing strategy is going:**  **The AI portfolio is down slightly from last week (Slowly bouncing back today)**  https://preview.redd.it/hl82lfkrekeb1.png?width=1715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d9bb9a5e9ea41a467f0fa9c966b12beb248e700  **I decided to adjust my automated investment strategy midweek (See below)**  ![img](zk5vp690fkeb1 "  ")  1. First, I look at the momentum of SPY generally, if not I move into SVOL (VIX etf). 2. If there's positive SPY momentum, I then look at if tech is overbought or not (RSI &gt;= 80). 3. If tech is overbought, I stay in SPY. 4. If tech is not overbought, I go into my AI strategy. It's threshold rebalancing at 10%.     https://preview.redd.it/1eeirt01fkeb1.png?width=1057&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=42aa2c207f60d2226856f52a58461bac68174e9d  As I initially mentioned, I intend to be super transparent about my bet on AI and share losses as much as wins.

[AMD has rebounded to $100, and it‚Äôs just the beginning,;,; With [Nvidia](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-NVDA/?ainvest_channel_token=reddit0327) stock price approaching all-time high, it could be also a good time to invest in AMD, which once hit an all-time high of $161 in November 2021.  Stone Fox Capital believes chip demand should back to growing mode as the inventory adjustment comes to an end. The company is strongly bullish on AMD, saying with the stock only rebounding to $100, it should has plenty of upside in the next few years.  [AMD](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AMD/?ainvest_channel_token=reddit0327) shares had once fallen all the way to a history low of under $55, and its data center CPU market share still has nowhere near Intel. As the market expected industries such as personal computers to start recovering, AMD rallied all the way to $100.  Counterpoint Research estimates that AMD holds about 20% of data centre CPU market in 2022, up from nearly 12% in 2021. In 2022, AMD generated $5.75 billion in revenue from data centre CPUs. If the company doubles its market share to 40%, its revenue will jump to $11.5 billion, while Intel holds a 50% market share.  With the launch of the new chips, [AMD](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AMD/?ainvest_channel_token=reddit0327) is expected to benefit from the huge demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI). The potential market size for AMD could soar from US$79 billion in 2020 to US$300 billion in 2027.  And getting back to $100 is only the beginning, as this is where it should be in last year.  Stone Fox Capital believes that [AMD](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AMD/?ainvest_channel_token=reddit0327) is on track to gain another $100 in the next few years, considering its P/E ratio is still less than half of Nvidia's expected P/E ratio.  Prior to the PC inventory adjustment, AMD's gross margins were close to around 50%. Higher margins and total revenue is driving the company's eps rising significantly.  Analysts have lowered their eps targets due to the weak demand environment and are now targeting above $4 and $5 for 2024 and 2025 respectively. Considering that these estimates are based on limited revenue growth expectations, there is still room for further growing.  Anyway, [AMD](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-AMD/?ainvest_channel_token=reddit0327)'s shares are trading at just 23 times of its 2024 eps target. Stone Fox Capital's previous research showed that AMD's revenue was only US$32 billion, but its eps was close to $6. Stone Fox expects the chip company to reach its target level much sooner than analysts had predicted due to a rebound in end market demand, and AMD taking more market share from Intel in the server market.

S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.5%, and Nasdaq-100 futures jumped 0.9%. ***** &gt; Nasdaq futures got a boost from Nvidia, which rose more than 8% on better-than-expected fourth quarter earnings and revenue. ***** &gt; The S&amp;P 500 is coming off its fourth straight losing session, dropping 0.2% on Wednesday. The Dow also fell, while the Nasdaq Composite posted a small gain. ***** &gt; The moves came after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of its most recent meeting, which concluded Feb. 1, showing that members of the central bank are resolved to keep fighting inflation with rate hikes. ***** &gt; Inflation ‚Äúremained well above‚Äù the Fed‚Äôs 2% target and the labor market ‚Äúremained very tight, contributing to continuing upward pressures on wages and prices,‚Äù according to the minutes. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe Fed is determined to free up some slack in the labor market, to ensure that inflation doesn‚Äôt get entrenched at its current high level,‚Äù said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. ‚ÄúBy mid-2023, year-over-year CPI inflation likely will have slowed to below the federal funds rate. But if inflation surprises to the upside again, or if the unemployment rate falls further, the Fed could hike more than in our forecast.‚Äù ***** &gt; More consumer earnings reports are due out Thursday morning, including Alibaba, Papa John‚Äôs, Wayfair and Bath &amp; Body Works. After the bell, investors will hear from Beyond Meat, Block, Warner Bros. Discovery and Carvana, among others. ***** &gt; In economic data, traders are looking forward to the latest GDP and weekly jobless claims data, which are both scheduled to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET Thursday. ***** &gt; Additionally, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic will speak at an event hosted by the Atlanta Fed Thursday morning.

[Fed‚Äôs Bullard: Markets have overpriced a recession,;,;  St. Louis Fed President James Bullard on Wednesday said he thinks the U.S. economy is more resilient than many investors have thought.  ‚ÄúI think markets have overpriced a recession in the second half of 2022 and overpriced a recession in the first half of 2023 and maybe they are overpricing the chances of a recession in the second half of 2023,‚Äù Bullard said in an interview on CNBC.  He noted that the Chinese economy was coming back from COVID lockdown and the European economy is stronger than expected.  ‚ÄúIt kind of seems like the U.S. economy might be more resilient than markets thought, let‚Äôs say, six to eight weeks ago,‚Äù he said.  Bullard said he forecast moderately slow growth with inflation declining in 2023.  ‚ÄúWe have a good shot at beating inflation in 2023,‚Äù he said, with the Fed focused on inflation and Congress focused on deficit reduction, he added.

[Ark Invest's Cathie Wood is betting big on AI with these 4 stocks‚Äîincluding one that could skyrocket 750%.,;,; Ark Invest‚Äôs Cathie Wood is known for investing in disruptive innovation. The super investor has placed big bets on artificial intelligence (AI), which is widely regarded as one of the most disruptive and transformative technologies today.  Speaking of AI stocks, it‚Äôs hard to ignore what **Nvidia Corp.** ($NVDA) has been doing. Shares of the chipmaking giant have surged 165% so far this year, and the company crossed $1 trillion in valuation at one point.  Ark Invest‚Äôs flagship fund **Ark Innovation ETF** ($ARKK) exited its position in Nvidia in January, but some of its other exchange-traded funds (ETFs) still have positions in the chipmaker.  In a recent interview with Bloomberg Television, Wood said that Nvidia ‚Äúwill do well over time.‚Äù But she sees a new group of stocks that will ‚Äúbenefit from the foundation that Nvidia has laid.‚Äù  The keyword is software.  ‚ÄúIn our view, for every dollar of hardware that Nvidia sells, software providers, SaaS \[software as a service\] providers will generate $8 in revenue,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo we are looking to the software providers who are actually right now where Nvidia was when we first bought it.‚Äù  The super investor then named three software companies she believes will thrive because of AI. Here‚Äôs a look at the trio and another company she calls ‚Äúthe biggest artificial intelligence play.‚Äù  ## UiPath Inc. ($PATH)  UiPath is a robotic process automation software company that provides automation solutions for businesses. Its AI-powered UiPath Business Automation Platform is capable of understanding, automating and operating end-to-end processes.  In the first quarter of 2023, the company‚Äôs revenue grew 18% year over year to $289.6 million. Notably, its dollar-based net retention rate was 122%.  The stock has surged 47% year to date, but it hasn‚Äôt always been a hot commodity: In 2022, UiPath shares plunged 70%.  Wood‚Äôs Ark Innovation ETF owns 28,865,375 shares of UiPath. With the position valued at $517.28 million, UiPath is the fourth-largest holding at Ark.  ## Twilio Inc. ($TWLO)  Twilio‚Äôs cloud communications platform allows businesses to develop and integrate various communication channels into their applications. Its application programming interfaces enable developers to incorporate voice, messaging and video seamlessly, helping companies enhance customer engagement.  In the first quarter, Twilio surpassed 300,000 active customer accounts. Meanwhile, revenue rose 15% year over year to $1.01 billion.  In its latest earnings conference call, Twilio Co-Founder and CEO Jeff Lawson said he believes that artificial intelligence ‚Äúwill be a material accelerant over time for Twilio‚Äôs business.‚Äù  Ark Innovation ETF holds 4,680,705 shares of Twilio, a stake with a market value of $303.54 million.  ## Teladoc Health Inc. ($TDOC)  Wood‚Äôs flagship fund also owns $301.07 million worth of telemedicine company Teladoc Health.  The company‚Äôs platform connects patients with healthcare professionals through video, phone and messaging.  At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, when in-person nonemergency medical care was temporarily halted, the demand for telehealth services skyrocketed.  In 2020, Teladoc attracted a lot of investor attention as its revenue shot up 98%.  While the pandemic is largely in the rearview mirror, the company continues to expand its business. Teladoc‚Äôs first-quarter revenue showed an 11% increase year over year.  The stock, however, wasn‚Äôt able to maintain the upward momentum. Trading at $24.30 per share, Teladoc is down more than 90% from its all-time high reached in February 2021.

[What's the difference between free float, free float market cap and shares outstanding?,;,; Correct me if I'm wrong . Shares outstanding is 100% all shares that exist. Free float are shares that are readily available for trade, excludes shares that are locked up from insiders. I'm still a bit confused to what free float market cap is. I looked up a few sources and it seems like they use the term shares outstanding and free float market cap. I think free float market cap is the free float times the share price , if it is why bother coming up with the term free float market cap. why not just use market cap instead?  If the value of free float market cap is free float times share price, then what value do the shares outstanding have since we calculate free float times share price and not shares outstanding times share price?   Free float and shares outstanding is a count of shares and free float market cap is the total  value of shares?,;,; 2023-09-04 18:27:25]
[Daily Trading Report üö®,;,; Good morning and happy Tuesday! I hope you all have had a wonderful long weekend and are feeling well rested going into this short week!      Short weeks have typically net us extremely profitable opportunities to both invest and trade, but the current market conditions are different and are providing us with false hopes and optimism that I‚Äôve been stating needs to be crushed. At the moment on the fear &amp; greed index, we are still at greed, which shows that the general sentiment on the market is still optimistic. This is either a bias confirmation of a reversal, or a sign that we are about to get wiped out.      Historically, the end of February is an extremely bearish time for the markets though, so please be on the look out. Please be extremely careful when attempting to allocate long into the markets and practice safe risk management when you are actively scalping &amp; day trading not only today, but for the rest of the month. As long as you are able to stay solvent while the markets are acting irrationally, you will be set to allocate when the markets are at its relative bottom and capitalize on the general fear and lack of liquidity the average trader will have.

[The Week Ahead &amp; More: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM + Trade Journal,;,; **OVERALL**:   The bank sector issues continued to cause money to flow into tech, but clearly not to the same degree as the week prior as the bulls stalled at a major resistance point.  Perhaps driven to a degree by the banks, the IWM is showing the most bearish chart with clear bear flag consolidation.  SPY could be viewed more neutrally with price stuck in a consolidation zone between two major TLs; however, when you factor the IWM and QQQ, probabilities suggest the break will go to the downside.  &amp;#x200B;  **SPY**:  Price remains stuck between two bearish levels: macro bear channel ceiling &amp; the mico downsloping TL from the February 2023 pivot high.  A parralel channel upsloping TL entered the picture this week, which will eventually 'pinch' price to the upside or downside (probabilities favor the downside, look at the Weekly bearish consolidation).  385.65 is the support level to watch this week, the cross-point of the upsloping TL and bear channel TL.  On the resistance side, 401.05 is the nearest level which must be broken through before more major resistance around 410 can come into play.  https://preview.redd.it/k669cp2h45qa1.jpg?width=2390&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=751e06ac39c1868d470a724738ff845ba1d05465  **QQQ**:  Price stalled at the February 2023 double top; however, did not immediately reject the level.  Therefore, price could be putting in bullish consolidation.  Friday's close kept probabilities for more upside still neutral; a 3rd day of weaker close would have changed those probabilities.  Still, given the huge run-up in tech since the banking sector collapse, more consolidation may be needed before another move higher...if a move higher is what happens.  Next reisstances are 322.84 or 329.28 gap-fills, but the major resistance level is 334.42 double top from August 2022.  Major support remains the upsloping TL from the October 2022 lows.  https://preview.redd.it/2i125t6o25qa1.jpg?width=2391&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b48a9a27eba69487d9bcb8c6701e1dca62897c73  **IWM**:  Price clearly rejected not only breaking back out from the bear channel, but also the upsloping TL coming off the October 2022 lows.  The resulting bearish consolidation (especially if you look at the Weekly chart) &amp; the potential breakdown towards the end of last week places probabilities on further downside...but that doesn't mean we couldn't see some limimted upside by virtue of consolidation.  Nearest major support is 162.76 double bottom from October 2022; nearest major resistance remains the aforementioned upsloping TL (bolstered by the 200 DMA).  https://preview.redd.it/x4wd65oa15qa1.jpg?width=2394&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5f3a87c16271e7c4bdae81c2f99bef9a14e57a2  &amp;#x200B;  My swing trading account is curently 63% invested.

[The Month Review: Technical Analysis &amp; Trade Journal for May 2023,;,; **OVERALL**:  Comparing the majors side-by-side show just how lopsided this 'rally' has been, with a clear breakout in QQQ, neutral consolidation in SPY, and clear bearish consolidation in IWM.  If IWM is playing the role of leading indicator as it often does, then this could tilt probabilities to the downside as we enter the summer...but...the similarities between how QQQ consolidated &amp; SPY is currently consolidating could indicate one final push higher for the broader market, before the larger macro bearish pattern plays out.  Only time will tell, but what is equally clear is how much resistance is sitting on top of all three majors, due to the down-move they made over the course of 2022.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/qwyaoc20eh3b1.jpg?width=2392&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=431a80cf2aa58dee11c391f5b4c09ce3af142370  **SPY**:  Price continued to grind higher over the course of May, and is currently struggling to break out of the February 2022 double top.  As a result, price remained in the mid-point of its upwards channel over the past month.  If price action follows what the QQQ did when it consolidated in a similar fashion, then the August 2022 double top (431.73) and the channel ceiling are major resistance before any true break out can occur.  Conversely, if this consolidation fails to move higher, then both upsloping channel floor TLs are major support.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/6o76j86nch3b1.jpg?width=2388&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94345bc930ca3488712c9ac6bdf4de054985eeff  **QQQ**:  The consolidation which occurred throughout April definitely played out in a big way throughout all of May.  Price ripped out of the channel &amp; through the August 2022 double top...and appears to be heading to a confluence of major resistance areas, namely the March 2022 gap fill at 361.10 to the March 2022 double top at 371.83.   That August 2022 double top (334.42) and upsloping TL from channel price broke out of are now the major resistance levels for tech.  Given how extended price is both from the October 2022 lows and since the May 2023 break out, as well as that confluence of resistance TLs, probabilities indicate at least consolidation...if not a bigger pullback to major support.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/dhxr8e75ch3b1.jpg?width=2395&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73dffd82f0b22ddf1acbd061a296c055b273f2d0  **IWM**: While May saw decent swings up/down on a daily basis, overall the index continues to consolidate sideways in what is a clear bear flag off the down-move that occurred in March.  The upsloping TL of the parallel channel floor is the major resistance line; whereas the October 2022 double bottom is the major support line.  Before hitting those levels, price would need to break out of that bear flag, however, which puts immediate resistance &amp; support at 179-180 &amp; 171-170 respectively.

[Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&amp;P 500 gains,;,; = just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing =  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023  [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-days-that-moved-the-stock-market-the-most-in-2023-611837d9)  &amp;#x200B;  The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&amp;P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.  &amp;#x200B;  It‚Äôs an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inflation battle, noted FactSet‚Äôs Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 top performing days for the S&amp;P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday‚Äôs close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%.  &amp;#x200B;  Through Dec. 22, the S&amp;P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&amp;P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.  &amp;#x200B;  Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&amp;P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  That didn‚Äôt mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.  &amp;#x200B;  Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.  &amp;#x200B;  Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.  &amp;#x200B;  The strategy ‚Äúindicates the Fed‚Äôs measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,‚Äù Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&amp;P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks‚Äô bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group‚Äôs announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.  &amp;#x200B;  SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a ‚Äúmini‚Äù banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.  &amp;#x200B;  Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks ‚Äî Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc.

Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?  &amp;#x200B;  Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly &amp; Co.

[Tesla ($TSLA) stock and six other tech titans are responsible for 86% of the S&amp;P 500 2023 performance.,;,;    Tesla($TSLA) stock **plunged nearly 10% last week on earnings**. That caught everyone's attention, but it was just the tip of the iceberg.  0 seconds of 14 secondsVolume 0%   With roughly one-third of the S&amp;P 500 companies **announcing quarterly earnings results this week**, there are none bigger than tech titans **Alphabet** ($**GOOGL**), **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**) and **Meta Platforms** ($META). These four Big Tech stocks alone account for 41% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 year-to-date gain, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.  Adding **Apple** ($**AAPL**), which reports next week, **Nvidia** ($**NVDA**) and **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) stock, Colas says these seven tech giants account for 86% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 gain, which was 7.7% through Monday's close. These seven Big Tech stocks have rallied far more than the S&amp;P 500 this year.  According to Colas, there have been three drivers of outperformance for these tech leaders. First, all seven were deeply oversold at the end of 2022 and received a "January Effect" bounce.  The January Effect is a seasonal increase in stock prices throughout the month of January. The increase in demand for stocks in January is often preceded by a decrease in prices during the month of December, in part due to tax-loss harvesting.     Second, many of these tech companies have been aggressively cutting costs, so earnings power should now be higher than last year. And, finally, interest rates have declined, supporting the valuation of high-multiple stocks, he added.  ## Alphabet, Microsoft Earnings Due  Google-owner Alphabet reports earnings after the closing bell Tuesday. Shares are just below a 106.69 buy point in a **cup with handle**, according to **IBD MarketSmith** chart analysis.  Alphabet earnings are expected to measure $1.08 a share on revenue of $68.8 billion.  Dow Jones software giant Microsoft slid almost 2% midday Tuesday, threatening to extend a losing streak to four sessions ahead of the company's earnings results late Tuesday. MSFT stock is rolling back toward a 276.86 buy point in a **flat base** following a March 17 breakout.  Wall Street expects Microsoft to earn $2.24 a share on revenue of $51.0 billion, per FactSet estimates.     ## Amazon, Meta Earnings Also On Deck  E-commerce giant Amazon continues to trace the right side of a **cup base**, but is seeing resistance around its long-term 200-day moving average.  With earnings due out late Thursday, Amazon is expected to earn 21 cents a share on sales of $124.5 billion.  Facebook parent Meta Platforms will report Wednesday after the stock market closes. Meta stock is out of buy range past a **197.26 buy point** in a flat base, but receding.  The social media giant is expected to earn $2.02 a share on revenue of $27.6 billion.  ## Apple Earnings Next Week  Apple shares reversed squarely lower midday Tuesday. Still, they remain solidly above a 157.48 buy point and at the top of the **5% buy range** that runs up to 165.35.  The Dow Jones tech giant reports its fiscal second-quarter results on May 4. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to earn $1.43 a share on sales of $92.9 billion.     ## Nvidia Holds Up; Tesla Stock Breaks Down  Graphics-chip maker Nvidia remains near its recent highs despite sharp losses midday Tuesday. Shares declined more than 2% in afternoon trade.  The **IBD Leaderboard stock** broke out past a 230.59 handle buy point after the **company's strong earnings on Feb. 23**.  Electric-vehicle giant Tesla stock continues to trade near its lowest level since Jan. 26. In recent weeks, shares triggered the **7%-8% loss rule** from a buy point at 200.76 in a cup with handle. And they are trading sharply below their 50-day line, a key level.,;,; 2023-04-26 06:14:46]
[The Month Review: Technical Snapshots &amp; Trade Journal for July 2023,;,; **OVERALL**:  The incredible up-move we've seen may be showing signs of cracking: big reversal candles, gap-ups that quickly sell off to session lows, and the inability to float higher on very low trading volume.  If the bears are, in fact, taking back control then QQQ (and to a lesser degree SPY) is at an interesting inflection point: did price put in its first lower-high (similar to 2007 prior to the 2008 drop)...or...will price put in a briefly higher-high (similar to Bitcoin in 2021 prior to the 2022 drop)?  &amp;#x200B;  **SPY**  Price has retraced 75% from the down-move put in during 2022; however, it did not make it back to the March 2022 pivot high before rolling over.  Major support is the upsloping TL of the channel price broke out of on 7/11/23 -- this level coincides with the failed breakout pivot high on June 15-16 and a gap window from that July day it finally did break out.  If it falls back within the channel, next support is around 430 which were pivot points on 8/16/22 and 6/26/23 respectively.  https://preview.redd.it/zfifvfkatggb1.jpg?width=2389&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=061989ecaa467e82982cb63d40c0b3cee9eda303  **QQQ**  Price has retraced almost completely from the down-move put in by the bear channel; however, it hit major resistance between the ATH pivot lows (Dec 2021) and 3/29/22 pivot high.  While this could be somewhat sloppy bullish consolidation, price just broke down through the upsloping TL it has been moving up along since June.  Now, price is sitting ontop of that major support level and has yet to break down through that level.  If this level breaks, there will be areas of minor support but the next major level is a return to around 350, what was once the upsloping channel ceiling TL which price broke out of on 5/18/23.  https://preview.redd.it/257t3f6jtggb1.jpg?width=2386&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a19656b57b4f987061bc90ade493c56b03046c16  **IWM**  Price continues to trade in the lower 50% of the down-move from Nov 2021 to Jun 2022, which suggests bearish consolidation on a longer time horizon and is interesting when juxtaposed with how bullish tech and even the SPY have moved.  If IWM is acting as a leading indicator here, then that would suggest a significant corrective move may be coming, especially for the biggest names such as the Magnificent 8.  Additionally, unlike the QQQ and SPY, IWM may have put in its 3rd slightly lower high from 8/16/22, 2/2/23, and 7/31/23 respectively.  The 202 - 198 area remains majors resistance, for both macro and micro pictures.  Looking at a shorter time horizon, price is sitting on major support from the upsloping TL it broke through on 7/12; if this level breaks, next support is around 188, then 179 before retesting 167.46 the current up-move's double bottom.  From a volume perspective, we've seen very light trading since early July, which has not caused price the float higher as steadily as it normally should, given how sideways price moved from mid-July to the end of the month.  https://preview.redd.it/f3e0wlpbuggb1.jpg?width=2386&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe087e0dcadc1f8a1c4f4fcd9b69ef2f96663827  &amp;#x200B;  My swing trading account is curently 85% invested; it got as high as 98%, but closing positions &amp; adding free cash reduced this percetnage to its current level.  In July, I closed 10x positions (9x winners and 1x loser):  **GOOGL** \-- calls -- +134.85%   **DAL** \-- investment -- +83.19%  (closed because covered calls got exercised by the buyer)   **TDOC** \-- calls -- 29.25%   **FIS** \-- calls -- +16.67%   **UUP** \-- calls -- +16%   **DAL** \-- puts -- +13.70%   **GDX** \-- long -- +10.73%   **UUP** \-- calls -- +8%   **VZ** \-- long -- +7.71%   **T** \-- long -- +3.5%  **PHM** \-- puts -- -100%  &amp;#x200B;  I opened or added to the following positions:  &amp;#x200B;  **CLH** \-- short -- entry 169.30 -- 1% of portfolio   **DXD** \-- long -- entry 38.03 -- 1% of portfolio   **MARA** \-- short -- entry 16.50 -- 0.33% of portfolio   **NVDA** \-- short -- new avg 393.95 -- 10% of portfolio   **RIVN** \-- buy 1/19/24 25.00 put options -- entry 5.20 -- 0.2% of portfolio  &amp;#x200B;  I also built a new investment position in **GLD**.

[The Week Ahead &amp; More: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM + Trade Journal,;,; **OVERALL**:  The Fed meeting will likely cause consolidation, but the regional banks &amp; energy could force a move.  IWM showing the weakest chart this week with a possible bear flag forming within the bear channel.  SPY is trading at the bottom of a parallel channel, suggesting a potential small bounce given all of the MA &amp; TL resistance directly overheard.  QQQ is pretty extended after last week's vertical move, but there is still a little room above before it hits a likely stall point.  If money leaves tech &amp; flow back into other sectors, we could see an inverse of last's week trading...as arguably last week we saw QQQ break out from bullish consolidation, SPY continue bullish consolidation, and IWM break down from what had been bullish consolidation.  That said, on the weekly &amp; monthly charts, we are still very much trading in a larger bearish pattern.  &amp;#x200B;  **SPY**:  Price never did officially breakdown back inside the bear channel; on the contrary, it did validate its move outside the bear channel.  The repeated tags on both side of the channel ceiling, however, weakens the line for both the bulls &amp; bears.  Price seems to be trading within an upsloping parallel channel since Fall 2022, which puts probabilities on the bear's side for an eventual breakdown &amp; re-test of the October 2022 low.  Before reaching that level, however, there is a major resistance level at 370 by an ascending TL (which also is trading parallel to the aforementioned parallel channel).  There will be some resistance at 402 descending TL, but major resistance is the upper range of the parallel channel, which is beginning to converge with the 431.73 mid-August 2022 double top  https://preview.redd.it/i62b0qx9wjoa1.jpg?width=2389&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b229926ebe9b55ce60ad7046ac9188884075b6b6  **QQQ**:  Price did indeed tag the ascending support TL Monday before ripping higher all week, as tech saw big cash inflows from instituitons seeking comparative 'safety' from the regional banking collapse &amp; energy breakdowns.  The near resistance levels got blown through all week, but price has not officially broken out yet from that descending resistance TL -- we need a close above 307.18 to do so.  If we get it, then that descending TL becomes major support; otherwise, major support remains the upsloping TL at 286 - 287.  Continued upside will likely pause at the 313.68 level, but if it can get through that then major resistance is between 318 - 320 which connects some pivot highs-to-lows from the past year.  https://preview.redd.it/6e3cx95drjoa1.jpg?width=2390&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06675610a0bca84ec6836d695cff4675cc203cfa  **IWM**: The regional bank collapse prevented a sustained bounce of the major support level that was the bear channel ceiling, but 170 did provide support throughout the week.  The multiple closes within the bear channel, and failed attempts to get out of the bear channel, is problematic for the bulls.  This week's price action could be bear flag consolidate between 170 and those former support TLs, which could be setting up for a move to retest the October 2022 pivot low at 162.76 -- the nearest major support level now.  If upside returns, then major resistance will be the ascending TL between 179 - 180 this week -- which will soon also converge with the 200 DMA.  https://preview.redd.it/opcjerrbqjoa1.jpg?width=2393&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2944c5532b42784fda889e1dec961fa98cfc1018  &amp;#x200B;  Within my swing trading portfolio, I closed the following positions...  **AXP** \-- swing/short  **+ 10.43**   **SCHW** \-- swing/long  **+ 17.29%**   **FRC** \-- intraday  **+ 32.54%**   **SPY** \-- daytrade  **+ 0.30%**  ...and I entered/added to the following positions...  **FITB** \-- new long -- avg $24.85 -- 1% position   **SIRI** \-- new long  -- avg $3.67  -- 0.5% position   **QID** \-- new long -- avg $20.17 -- 2% position   **BITI** \-- new long -- avg 22.87 -- 1% position   **CVS** \-- add long -- avg now $80.69 -- now 4% position   **CHD** \-- add short -- avg now $83.78 -- now 1% position  &amp;#x200B;  In closing, the following names are on my watch list this week &amp; I do my best to post trades as close to real-time as possible through my **StockTwits**:  **ALL** \-- long   **AMD** \-- short   **ANET** \-- short   **BAC** \-- long   **C** \-- long   **CNC** \-- long   **HAL** \-- long   **HPE** \-- long   **IBM** \-- long   **LNC** \-- long   **MSFT** \-- short   **NVDA** \-- short   **NWL** \-- long   **USB** \-- long,;,; 2023-03-18 20:43:04]
[Daily Trading Report üö®,;,; Good morning and happy Monday! Markets are up slightly from close on Friday, and this should be an exciting week for the markets. We are going to have a difficult week on the markets, so please mentally and physically prepare to actively trade as there will be many opportunities to scalp &amp; day trade.      Expect to see some bearish momentum today and tomorrow, followed by hopefully an extremely green day on the 1st of the month.      I am out of all my significant bearish positions at the moment. There is a good chance we continue to come down, but realistically I believe we are close to the short-term bottom. We may continue down over the next couple of weeks, so remain fluid and go with the general momentum in the markets.

[Dow Jones rises but leaders tumble, and Tesla ($TSLA) stock triggers the sell rule.,;,;  Dow Jones futures were little changed early Thursday, along with S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The stock market rally struggled Wednesday as weak economic data raised recession fears for a second straight session.    The major indexes still don't look too bad, with the Nasdaq sliding but the Dow Jones rising.  But once again, declining stocks decisively beat winners. Once again, many of those losers fell hard. But on Wednesday, a lot of more of those big losers were leading stocks, such as **On Holding** ($**ONON**), **MarketAxess** ($**MKTX**) and **PagerDuty** ($**PD**). **C3.ai** ($**AI**) sold off for a second session, with the AI stock now staging a massive, outside week to the downside.  Others, including many chip names, declined solidly, now showing more chart damage after relatively modest retreats Tuesday.  **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) skidded for a third straight day, triggering the automatic sell rule.   Megacap techs such as **Apple** ($**AAPL**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**), Google parent **Alphabet** (**GOOGL**), **Meta Platforms** ($**META**) and **Nvidia** all fell.  Meanwhile, bank stocks came under more pressure. **Western Alliance Bancorp** (**WAL**) plunged, leading a retreat in regional banks, though they pared losses in the afternoon. **Charles Schwab**hit a two-year closing low. While bank deposits may be relatively safe, the bigger issue now may be long-term bank profitability as well as lending curbs that rapidly slow the economy.  Medical names are looking relatively strong, along with other defensive growth or defensive plays.  PagerDuty stock, On Holding, Meta and Nvidia are on **IBD Leaderboard**. Microsoft and Google stock are on the **IBD Long-Term Leaders** list.   Despite relatively benign action in the major indexes, the weakness in growth and other leading stocks is concerning. Investors should be looking to protect profits and cut losses.  ## Costco Sales Weak  Costco same-store sales fell 1.1% in March vs. a year earlier, the first decline in nearly three years. U.S. comps slid 1.5%. Excluding gasoline and currency effects, comps rose 2.6% or 0.9% in the U.S. E-commerce comps tumbled 11.6%. COST stock fell modestly.  ## Dow Jones Futures Today  Dow Jones futures edged higher vs. fair value. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.2%.  The Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. That follows unexpectedly weak February job openings and the March ADP Employment Report. Labor will release the March jobs report on Friday morning, but U.S. markets will be closed.   ## Stock Market Rally  The stock market rally had a generally negative session, despite the mixed action on the major indexes.  The ADP Employment Report showed private payrolls rose much less than expected in March, a day after a big drop in February job openings. The March ISM services index fell more than expected, signaling rapidly slowing growth.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% in Wednesday's **stock market trading**. The S&amp;P 500 index dipped 0.25%. The Nasdaq composite retreated 1.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 1%.  U.S. crude oil prices dipped 0.1% to $80.61 a barrel.  The 10-year Treasury yield declined 5 basis points to 3.285%. That's the lowest point in nearly seven months. The 2-year Treasury yield sank 7 basis points to 3.76%, off 34 basis points in the past four sessions.  ## ETFs  Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ($**FFTY**) shed 1.9%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ($**BOUT**) gave up 0.65%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ($**IGV**) slipped 1.3%. Microsoft stock and a few other heavyweights dominate IGV, while more-speculative software names like PagerDuty suffered bigger losses. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([**SMH**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=SMH)) gave up 1.75%, with NVDA stock a major holding.  Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF ($**ARKK**) slumped 3.6% and ARK Genomics ETF (**ARKG**) shed 1.8%. TSLA stock is the top holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. Some Ark funds also own PD stock.  SPDR S&amp;P Metals &amp; Mining ETF (**XME**) retreated 1.15% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (**PAVE**) 1.7%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (**JETS**) and SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (**XHB**) descended 1.5%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (**XLE**) climbed 1.5% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (**XLV**) rallied 1.7% to its best level since Feb. 14.  ## Bank Stocks  The Financial Select SPDR ETF (**XLF**) edged down 0.1%, with SCHW stock a top 10 holding. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (**KRE**), which includes WAL stock, sank 1% but finished off lows.  Western Alliance stock plunged as much as 19.4% after releasing some financial metrics but not disclosing deposits. Shares came off their lows as the California-based bank disclosed deposits fell 11% on March 31 vs. the end of 2022, not as bad as some feared. Still, WAL stock closed down 12.4%.,;,; 2023-04-06 11:23:50]

Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news on this Friday, March the 24th, 2023-  *****  #[Dow futures drop more than 300 points as Deutsche Bank sparks concerns over global banking system: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/stock-futures-are-up-slightly-as-investors-weigh-bank-troubles-fed-decision.html)  ***** &gt; Stock futures fell Friday as Wall Street fretted over the state of the global banking system once again. ***** &gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 333 points, or 1.03%. S&amp;P 500 futures dipped 0.84%, while Nasdaq-100 futures were 0.5% lower. ***** &gt; Deutsche Bank‚Äôs U.S.-listed shares slid about 11% in the premarket after the the German lender‚Äôs credit default swaps jumped. The move appeared to raise concerns once again over the health of the European banking industry. Earlier this month, Swiss regulators forced a UBS acquisition of rival Credit Suisse. ***** &gt; Shares of major U.S. banks were also under pressure. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo fell more than 2% each. Meanwhile, Citigroup fell more than 3%. ***** &gt; Wall Street is coming off a volatile session Thursday that ultimately ended with the major averages posting solid gains. The Nasdaq Composite posted the largest gain, at 1%, as technology shares continued to rally on a hunch that interest rate hikes would be coming to an end. The S&amp;P 500 ended around 0.3% higher, while the Dow finished up 0.2%. ***** &gt; For the week, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 are up around 0.8% each, while the Nasdaq has gained 1.4% through Thursday‚Äôs close. ***** &gt; Investors have been assessing the Fed‚Äôs latest policy move announced this week. The central bank hiked rates by a quarter-point. However, it also hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be ending soon. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that credit conditions have tightened, which could put pressure on the economy. ***** &gt; The ‚Äúprimary driver of market volatility is investors assessing the push-and-pull between price stability and financial stability,‚Äù said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.

[(4/5) Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,;,; #Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, April the 5th, 2023-  *****  # [Stock futures are flat after Dow, S&amp;P 500 snap four-day win streaks: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/04/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)  ***** &gt; U.S. stock futures were lower on Wednesday as traders assess the state of the global economy following a losing session. ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 15 points, or less than 0.1%, while S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures were also down less than 0.1% each. ***** &gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson shares rose nearly 3% in premarket trading after the pharmaceutical company said Tuesday it would pay $8.9 billion over the next 25 years to settle claims that its talc products caused cancer. ***** &gt; Wednesday‚Äôs moves come as concern over higher rates simmered once again. New Zealand‚Äôs central bank overnight hiked rates by 50 basis points, noting that inflation was ‚Äútoo high and persistent.‚Äù ***** &gt; On Tuesday, the Dow shed nearly 200 points, snapping a four-day win streak as broader economic concerns weighed on equities. The S&amp;P 500 fell by 0.58%, also snapping a string of four consecutive winning sessions. The Nasdaq Composite dropped by 0.52%. ***** &gt; Investors digested the latest job openings report that suggested the Federal Reserve‚Äôs efforts to cool the labor market might finally be having an effect. In February, the number of available positions fell below 10 million for the first time in nearly two years. ***** &gt; Meanwhile, the energy market added to uncertainty this week after OPEC+ said it would cut output by 1.16 million barrels of oil per day. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs some consolidation after a stellar rally that we had last week,‚Äù Anastasia Amoroso, chief investment strategist at iCapital, said Tuesday on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell.‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚ÄúBut that still doesn‚Äôt deter me from saying that I think we can have a more positive tone to April because if you look at the broader picture, we sort of have the recipe for a soft landing, which is inflation expectations are coming down. And broadly speaking, economic data is surprising to the upside. So that actually still supports a resilient stock market,‚Äù Amoroso added. ***** &gt; On Wednesday, traders are expecting the latest ADP private payrolls report before the bell. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting a rise of 210,000 jobs in March, down from an increase of 242,000 in the previous month. ***** &gt; The latest reading of the ISM Services Index is also set to release. Economists are forecasting a reading of 54.3, according to Dow Jones consensus estimates. That‚Äôs down slightly from 55.1 in the previous release.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/Eox8X1g.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/e5TNk13.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/R1ckH1K.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ks7UJDJ.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/0v7CXuP.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/XbT9sdN.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$SAIC $CAG $LW $AYI $STZ $FLGC $MSM $OCX $DLO $RPM $LEVI $SMPL $LNN $APLD $SCHN $EGY $IONM $KRUS $GNLN $SGH $RELL $WDFC $FRLN $SNAX $ZENV $CLIR $RGP $SLP $SDRL $NG*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5Y8HITW.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$SGH $CAG $KRUS $SMPL $RGP $SCHN $NG $SDRL $DLO $ZENV*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/SfocW4d.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/sLHW9Cl.png)**)  *****  #THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**) (N/A.)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/rOoGdf2.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Wr2iP22.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/nyokG7D.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/o5QmcPE.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/MVklN5a.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/pMgdsD4.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/PQg36zb.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:  * PLTR * AI * GOOGL * BFRG * SMPL * AUPH * CAG * AGO * NVDA * GOOG  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/05/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-jnj-fdx-zion.html)**)  *****  &gt; **Johnson &amp; Johnson** ‚Äî The pharmaceutical giant climbed 2.6% after announcing Tuesday it will pay $8.9 billion over the next 25 years to settle claims that the talc in its baby powder and other products caused cancer.

[(3/22) Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,;,; #Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to FOMC Rate Decision Day and a new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, March the 22nd, 2023-  *****  # [Stock futures are flat as investors await key Fed policy decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/21/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)  ***** &gt; Stock futures were slightly lower Wednesday as investors braced for the Federal Reserve‚Äôs next move in its inflation-fighting rate hiking plan. ***** &gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 14 points, or 0.04%. S&amp;P 500 futures were down 0.02%, while Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.14%. ***** &gt; The major averages posted strong gains in the previous session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 316 points, or nearly 1%. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 1.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.58%. ***** &gt; The moves came as fears over the ongoing banking crisis showed signs of easing, with investors ‚Äúheartened by the increasing likelihood that the end of Fed policy tightening is near,‚Äù said Brian Levitt, global market strategist for Invesco. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúFed tightening cycles typically end with a crisis, and those crises tend to end with policy responses. That may help to explain today‚Äôs market moves,‚Äù he added. ***** &gt; Investors are looking forward to the latest update from the Fed, at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday. Most investors expect the central bank to stay committed to its tightening and raise rates by 25 basis points. ***** &gt; As of Wednesday morning, there is about an 85% chance of a quarter-point increase by the Fed, according to CME Group‚Äôs FedWatch tool. Meanwhile, there‚Äôs a roughly 15% probability of there being no hike. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúWe think the Fed will take that next step, that 25 basis point increase, but probably wrap that in some pretty dovish language to indicate they‚Äôre close to the end, if not at the end,‚Äù said Neuberger Berman‚Äôs Erik Knutzen said on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn a way, it almost doesn‚Äôt matter, it‚Äôs priced in. What‚Äôs most important is the broad liquidity being provided through the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet and some of the programs they put in place, the liquidity they provided last week.‚Äù ***** &gt; He added that that could lead to ‚Äúconsiderable tightening, as banks change their posture in this more challenging environment ‚Äî and that‚Äôs the part that we think is going to have the biggest negative impact on the economy.‚Äù ***** &gt; Elsewhere, investors are expecting an update on the latest MBA mortgage purchase applications reading. There are also a handful of companies slated to post results Wednesday, including Tencent and Winnebago.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/EtSPxZ1.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec_all)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZTmGBxl.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/BttIFnH.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/73vXuqs.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/kkUKWxH.png)**)  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$PDD $ARRY $NKE $FL $GME $CSIQ $TME $CHWY $GIS $ACN $NIU $RVLP $WOOF $DRI $DOYU $ONON $ADMA $FDS $BZ $BRAG $AIR $KBH $DOOO $GAMB $CMC $EXPR $OLLI $HQY $BITF $ACDC $NVGS $HRTX $HUYA $AEVA $CTRN $WGO $LLAP $OXSQ $SMTI $XFOR $PHUN $SPPI $BZUN $EXAI $WVE $PHR $HYPR $KULR $XGN $SCVL*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/JxG6hIn.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$NKE $GME $ARRY $WOOF $AIR $OLLI $HQY $WGO $TELA $VNET $SPPI $SCVL $BZUN $WVE $HEPS $HYPR $ZH $BLRX $UTRS $TZOO $TBIO $ATXS*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/lzPqHMA.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/iG7p2XB.png)**)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Bgspzsf.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/aixh6LL.png)**) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/UnMSqhf.png)**)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/PGtvYye.png)**)  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/4h3hlGm.png)**)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:  * GME * XRP.X * NKE * DWAC * ETNB * EH * WOOF * NVDA * UNFI * SPX  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/22/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-gme-lazr-vorb.html)**)  *****  &gt; **GameStop** ‚Äî The meme stock surged 44% after the company posted a quarterly profit for the first time in two years Tuesday.

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023,;,; Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023.  # **Stocks close higher Friday as investors try to shake off latest bank fears: Live updates - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/stock-futures-are-up-slightly-as-investors-weigh-bank-troubles-fed-decision.html)** ***** &gt; Stocks rose Friday, reversing their earlier session declines as Deutsche Bank shares pared back some losses. ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 132.28 points, or 0.41%, closing at 32,238.15. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.57%, while Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.3%. The major indexes all had a winning week, with the Dow gaining 0.4% week-to-date as of Friday afternoon, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq gained 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively. ***** &gt; Deutsche Bank‚Äôs U.S.-listed shares slid 3.11% Friday, rebounding from a 7% drop earlier in the trading session. A selloff of shares was triggered after the the German lender‚Äôs credit default swaps jumped, but without an apparent catalyst. The move appeared to raise concerns once again over the health of the European banking industry. Earlier this month, Swiss regulators forced a UBS acquisition of rival Credit Suisse. Deutsche Bank shares traded off their worst levels of the session, which caused major U.S. indexes to also cut their losses. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think that the market overall is neither frightened nor optimistic ‚Äî it‚Äôs simply confused,‚Äù said George Ball, president at Sanders Morris Harris. ‚ÄúThe price action for the last month-and-a-half, including today, is a jumble without any direction or conviction.‚Äù ***** &gt; Ball added that Deutsche Bank is ‚Äúvery sound financially.‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIt could be crippled if there‚Äôs a big loss of confidence and there‚Äôs a run on the bank. There is, however, no fundamental reason why that should occur, other than nervousness.‚Äù ***** &gt; European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde tried to ease concerns, saying euro zone banks are resilient with strong capital and liquidity positions. Lagarde said the ECB could provide liquidity if needed. ***** &gt; Investors continued to assess the Fed‚Äôs latest policy move announced this week. The central bank hiked rates by a quarter-point. However, it also hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be ending soon. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that credit conditions have tightened, which could put pressure on the economy. ***** &gt; On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said regulators are prepared to take more action if needed to stabilize U.S. banks. Her comments are the latest among regulators attempting to buoy confidence in the U.S. banking system in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank closures. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúRetail [and] institutional investors are both looking at the banking system, but now internationally. That‚Äôs dangerous,‚Äù Ball added. ‚ÄúBanks exist because of confidence in their stability, and that confidence can be eroded as we now see, via social media and technology in a matter of minutes.‚Äù  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/kYFZ0mb.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/sa1yxWq.png))**  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/QsHW7no.png))**  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/OGQZBeP.png))**  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/uIef67v.png))**  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kr3YfHV.png))**  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JiYUEBP.png))**  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CKcDnul.png))**  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vsFHgKf.png))**  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mconM20.png))**  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/H7KFVcz.png))**  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ymKQozZ.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/TsJcX1J.png))**   *****  &gt; # Best and Worst Stocks Since the COVID Crash Low  &gt; We are now three years out from the COVID Crash low, and even with the past year's weakness, most assets continue to sit on solid gains. For major US index ETFs, the S&amp;P Midcap 400 (IJH) is up the most having slightly more than doubled while the S&amp;P Smallcap 600 (IJR) is not far behind having rallied 95.9%. Value has generally outperformed growth, especially for mid and small-caps although that has shifted somewhat this year. For example, while its gains have been more middling since the COVID crash, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has been the strongest area of the equity market in 2023 thanks to the strength of sectors like Tech (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC). Although those sectors have posted strong gains this year, they have been the weakest over the past three years while Energy (XLE) far and away has been the strongest asset class. Paired with the strength of energy stocks has been solid runs in commodities (DBC)more broadly with the notable exception being Natural Gas (UNG) which has lost over 40%. Bond ETFs are similarly sitting on losses since the COVID Crash lows. As for international markets, Mexico (EWW) and India (PIN) have outpaced the rest of the world although Emerging Markets (EEM) as a whole have not been particularly strong; likely being dragged on by the weaker performance of China (ASHR) which holds a large weight on EEM.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low.png))**  &gt; Taking a look at current S&amp;P 500 members, nearly half of the index has more than doubled over the past three years. As for the absolute best performers, Energy stocks dominate the list with four of the top five best-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks coming from that sector. Targa Resources (TRGP) has been the absolute best performer with a nearly 900% total return. Other notables include a couple of heavy weight stocks: Tesla (TSLA) and NVIDIA (NVDA) with gains of 563.9% and 412.9%, respectively.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low-2.png))**  &gt; On the other end of the spectrum, there are currently 25 stocks that have posted a negative return since the COVID Crash low. The worst has been First Republic Bank (FRC) which has been more of a recent development. Whereas today the stock has posted an 83.1% loss, at the start of this month it would have been a 65% gain. Another standout on the list of worst performers has been Amazon (AMZN). Most other mega caps have more than doubled since the March 2020 S&amp;P 500 low, however, the e-commerce giant has hardly offered a positive return.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-COVID-Low-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # Sector Performance Experiences a Historical Divergence  &gt; The first quarter of 2023 is coming to a close next week, and checking in on year to date performance, there has been a big divergence between the winners and losers. Although the S&amp;P 500 is up 2.84% on the year as of yesterday's close, only three of the eleven sectors are higher. Not only are those three sectors up on the year, but they have posted impressive double digit gains only three months into the year. Of those three, Consumer Discretionary has posted the smallest gain of 10% whereas Technology and Communication Services have risen 17.2% and 18.1%, respectively. The fact that these sectors are home to the main mega cap stocks -- like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have been on an impressive run of late -- helps to explain how the market cap weighted S&amp;P 500 is up on the year without much in the way of healthy breadth on a sector level.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-1a.png))**  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-1.png))**  &gt; One thing that is particularly remarkable about this year's sector performance is just how rare it is for a sector to be up 10%+ (let alone 3) while all other sectors are lower. And that is for any point of the year let alone in the first quarter. As we mentioned in yesterday's Sector Snapshot and show in the charts below, going back to 1990, there have only been two other periods in which a sector has risen at least 10% YTD while all other sectors were lower YTD. The first of those was in May 2009. In a similar instance to now, Consumer Discretionary, Tech, and Materials were the three sectors with double digit gains back then. With those sectors up solidly, the S&amp;P 500 was little changed on the year with a less than 1% gain. As you can see below, though, by the end of 2009, every sector had pushed into positive territory as the new bull market coming out of the global financial crisis was well underway.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-2.png))**  &gt; The next occurrence was much more recent: 2022. Obviously, it was a tough year for equities except for the Energy sector which had a banner year. Throughout most of the year, the sector traded up by well over 20% year to date even while the rest of the equity market was battered.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032423-Sector-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # The Fed Expects Banking Stress to Substitute for Rate Hikes  &gt; The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 0.25% at their March meeting, bringing it to the 4.75-5.0% range. This is the ninth-straight rate increase and brings rates to their highest level since 2007. However, the most aggressive tightening cycle since the early 1980s, which saw them lift rates all the way from near zero to almost 5%, is near its end.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-target-rate-601x800.png))**  &gt; Up until early February, Fed officials expected to raise rates to a maximum of about 5.1% and hold it there for a while. However, since that time, we‚Äôve gotten a slew of strong economic data, including elevated inflation numbers. This pushed fed officials to give ‚Äúguidance‚Äù that they expected to raise rates by more than they estimated back in December.  &gt; Market expectations for policy also moved in conjunction. Prior to February, markets expected the Fed to raise rates to 5% by June, and subsequently lower them by about 0.5% by the end of the year. But strong incoming data and Fed guidance pushed expectations higher, with the terminal rate moving up to 5.6% and no cuts in 2023.  &gt; # The Silicon Valley Bank crisis changed everything &gt; The bank crisis that erupted over the last couple of weeks resulted in a significant shift, both in expectations for policy and now the Fed as well. See here for our complete rundown on SVB and the ensuing crisis.  &gt; Market expectations for Fed policy rates immediately moved lower. Markets expected the stress in banks to translate to tighter credit conditions, which in turn would lead to slower economic growth and lower inflation.  &gt; This was nicely articulated by Professor Jeremey Siegel, one of the foremost commentators on financial markets and fed policy, in our latest episode of the Facts vs Feelings podcast, Prof. Siegel said that tighter credit conditions, as lending standards become more strict, are de facto rate hikes.  &gt; Fed Chair Powell more or less said exactly the same thing after the Fed‚Äôs March meeting. The 0.25% increase was an attempt to thread the needle between financial stability and fighting inflation. Fed officials also forecast the fed funds rate to hit a maximum of 5.1%, unchanged from their December estimate. This is a marked shift from what was expected just a few weeks ago, with Powell explicitly saying that tighter credit conditions ‚Äúsubstitute‚Äù for rate hikes.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-Fed-rate-expectations-600x800.png))**  &gt; # There‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty ahead &gt; While the recent bank stresses are expected to tighten credit conditions and thereby impact economic growth and inflation, there are a couple of open questions:  &gt; * How big will the impact be?  &gt; * How long will the impact last?  &gt; These are unknown currently. Which means future policy is also unknown.  &gt; Fed officials expect to take rates to 5.1%, i.e., one more rate increase. And then expect to hold it there through the end of the year. In short, they don‚Äôt expect rate cuts this year.  &gt; Yet investors expect no more rate increases and about 0.6% of rate cuts in the second half of 2023. Markets expect the policy rate in June to be at 4.8%, while expectations for December are at 4.2%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Blog-2023-03-23-implied-policy-rate-differential-600x800.png))**  &gt; There‚Äôs clearly a huge gulf between what the Fed expects versus what investors expect. This will have to reconcile in one of two ways:  &gt; * Market expectations move higher ‚Äì if economic/inflation data remain strong and credit conditions don‚Äôt look to be tightening significantly.  &gt; * Fed expectations move lower ‚Äì if the banking sector comes under renewed stress, credit conditions could tighten significantly and eventually lead to weaker data.  &gt; Things are obviously not going to go in either direction in a straight line. It‚Äôs going to be a bumpy ride as new data points come in, not to mention news/rumors of renewed problems in the banking sector.  *****  &gt; # Seasonality Keeps Claims Below 200K?  &gt; Initial jobless claims remained healthy this week with another sub-200K print. Claims fell modestly to 191K from last week's unrevised reading of 192K. That small decline exceeded expectations of claims rising up to 197K. Given claims continue to impress, the seasonally adjusted number has come in below 200K for 9 of the last 10 weeks. By that measure, it has been the strongest stretch for claims since last April when there were 10 weeks in a row of sub-200K prints. Prior to that, from 2018 through 2020 the late March and early April period similarly saw consistent readings under 200K meaning that some of the strength in the adjusted number could be on account of residual seasonality.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-1.png))**  &gt; In fact, this point of the year has some of the weeks in which claims have the most consistently historically fallen week over week. Taking a historical median of claims throughout the year, claims tend to round out a short-term bottom in the spring before an early summer bump. In other words, seasonal strength will begin to wane in the coming months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Claims-2.png))**  &gt; While initial claims improved, continuing claims worsened rising to 1.694 million from 1.68 million the previous week. Albeit higher, that remains below the 2023 high of 1.715 million set at the end of February.  *****  &gt; # A Fed Day Like Most Others  &gt; Yesterday's Fed decision and comments from Fed Chair Powell gave markets plenty to chew on. As we discussed in last night's Closer and today's Morning Lineup, there have been a number of conflicting statements from officials and confusing reactions in various assets over the past 24 hours. In spite of all that uncertainty, the S&amp;P 500's path yesterday pretty much followed the usual script. In the charts below we show the S&amp;P's average intraday pattern across all Fed days since Powell has been chair (first chart) and the intraday chart of the S&amp;P yesterday (second chart). As shown, the market's pattern yesterday, especially after the 2 PM ET rate decision and the 2:30 PM press conference, closely resembled the average path that the market has followed across all Powell Fed Days since 2018.  &gt; The S&amp;P saw a modest bounce after the 2 PM Fed decision and then a further rally right after Powell's presser began at 2:30 PM. That initial post-presser spike proved to be a pump-fake, as markets ultimately sold off hard with a near 2% decline from 2:30 PM to the 4 PM close.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-1a.png))**  &gt; So what typically happens in the week after Fed days? Since 1994 when the Fed began announcing policy decisions on the same day as its meeting, the S&amp;P has averaged a decline of 10 basis points over the next week. During the current tightening cycle that began about a year ago, market performance in the week after Fed days has been even worse with the S&amp;P averaging a decline of 0.99%. However, when the S&amp;P has been down over 1% on Fed days (like yesterday), performance over the next week has been positive with an average gain of 0.64%. As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032323-Fed-Comp-3.png))**  *****   &gt; # What Now? An Update on Recent Bank Stress.  &gt; It‚Äôs been less than 2 weeks since Silicon Valley Bank‚Äôs stunning 48-hour collapse, and a few more banks have been caught in the fray. New York regulators closed the doors on Signature Bank on Sunday, March 12. A week later, US banks injected $30 billion into First Republic Bank to keep it afloat, and UBS acquired rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse in a government-brokered deal. In the midst of the chaos, your Carson Investment Research team was there for you with client-facing content, professional advice, and investment solutions. In fact, we think this event presents an opportunity to invest in the more stable large-cap financial companies and recently upgraded the sector to overweight in our House Views Advice.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mar22_1-1600x927.png))**  &gt; # Why is this happening? &gt; The rapid hike in interest rates caused an asset and liability mismatch for banks. Due to many years of low-interest rates, banks invested assets in interest-earning loans and bonds that would be repaid over the next five-plus years, which at the time was a logical way to earn a higher yield. Regulators considered government bonds to be among the safest ways a bank could invest its capital. As interest rates rose, bond values dropped. Interest rates rose at the fastest pace in history, and the safe assets that banks invested in lost value to the tune of more than $620 billion in unrealized losses as of the end of last year. This decline in value left weaker banks underwater and, when coupled with depositors pulling money out, caused them to collapse or seek costly capital raises.  &gt; # Why this matters to investors? &gt; The weakness in the banking sector will likely lead to tighter lending standards, potentially slowing economic growth. The reason we‚Äôre in this mess, to begin with, is that the Fed hiked interest rates to slow the economy because inflation was rising too quickly. Perhaps the 16% drop in oil prices over the past two weeks reflected this slower growth and bodes well for continued falling inflation. Thus, the Fed is closer to achieving its goal.  &gt; Maybe it‚Äôs an overreaction as ‚Äúbanking crisis‚Äù headlines stir painful memories of 2008. Either way, an environment with slower growth and lower inflation isn‚Äôt a bad time to invest. Bonds and stocks could both perform well, especially stocks of companies with the ability to grow earnings. We also reiterate our House Views Advice overweight on the large-cap Financials sector. The largest US banks are well-capitalized and are gaining market share from the smaller regional banks. We believe this calamity provides an opportunity for stronger banks and investors to capitalize on.  *****  &gt; # FANG+ Flying  &gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup, sector performance has heavily favored areas like Tech, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services in recent weeks. Playing into that sector level performance has been the strength of the mega-caps. The NYSE FANG+ index tracks ten of the largest and most highly traded Tech and Tech-adjacent names. In the past several days, that cohort of stocks is breaking out to the highest level since last April whereas the S&amp;P 500 still needs to rally 4% to reach its February high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-1.png))**  &gt; Although FANG+ stocks have been strong recently, that follows more than a full year of underperformance. As shown below, relative to the S&amp;P 500, mega-cap Tech consistently underperformed from February 2021 through this past fall. In the past few days, the massive outperformance has resulted in a breakout of the downtrend for the ratio of FANG+ to the S&amp;P 500.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-2.png))**  &gt; More impressive is how rapid of a move it has been for that ratio to break out. Below, we show the 2-month percent change in the ratio above. As of the high at yesterday's close, the ratio had risen 22.5% over the prior two months. That comes up just short of the record (22.6%) leading up to the pre-COVID high in February 2020. In other words, mega-cap Tech has experienced near-record outperformance relative to the broader market. However, we would note that this is in the wake of last year when the group had seen some of its worst two-month underperformance on record with the worst readings being in March, May, and November.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032223-FANG-3.png))**  *****  &gt; # March Seasonality Prevails, Banking Fiasco Be Damned  &gt; It‚Äôs encouraging typical March seasonal patterns have overcome recent bank failures, recession talk and fearmongering. The early March pullback was steeper than normal, but the usual mid-month rebound appears to be materializing.  &gt; Last week‚Äôs gains could be an indication we have seen the worst of the banking fallout and the end of the pullback. Triple Witching Weeks have tended to be down in flat periods and dramatically so during bear markets. Positive March Triple Witching weeks in 2003 and 2009 confirmed the market was back in rally mode.  &gt; The week after March Triple Witching is notoriously nasty. S&amp;P is down 27 of the last 40 year ‚Äì and frequently down sharply. Positive or flat action this week would be constructive.  &gt; In the old days March used to come in like a bull and out like a bear. Nowadays March has evolved into an inflection point where short-term trends often change course. The market is clearly at an important juncture and it‚Äôs a good time to remember Warren Buffet‚Äôs wise words to ‚ÄúBe greedy when others are fearful.‚Äù  &gt; Bank failures are never a good thing, but the swift actions of regulators likely prevented further damage to the industry. At the least, the banks are likely to be under even greater scrutiny going forward. In the near-term we expect more volatile trading. Further out we expect the market, and the economy will recover like they both have historically done.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/5fe6f3377343f819ff93c97e8aeb8ffc/1258a39f06bd18c7-63/s500x750/303b38d927e1a424f5dc254dd086678978f2cc12.jpg))**  *****  &gt; # Nasdaq Leaves the S&amp;P in the Dust  &gt; Looking at the major US index ETF screen of our Trend Analyzer shows just how disconnected the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has become from other major index ETFs recently. As shown below, as of Friday's close, QQQ actually finished in overbought territory (over 1 standard above its 50-DMA) whereas many other major index ETFs were oversold, some of those to an extreme degree. On a year to date basis, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has rallied more than 14% compared to low single digit gains or losses for the rest of the pack.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/usindexqqq.png))**  &gt; Historically, the major indices, namely the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, tend to trade at similar overbought and oversold levels. In the chart below we show the Nasdaq 100 and S&amp;P 500's distance from their 50-DMAs (expressed in standard deviations) over the past five years. As shown, typically the two large cap indices have seen similar albeit not identical readings. That is until the past few weeks in which the two have diverged more significantly.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**  &gt; On Friday there was more than 2 standard deviations between the Nasdaq's overbought 50-DMA spread and the S&amp;P 500's oversold spread. As shown in the chart below, that surpassed recent highs in the spread like the spring of 2020 to set the highest reading since October 2016.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/03/032023-SPX-NDX-2.png))**  &gt; Going back to 1985, the spread between the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 50-DMA spreads diverging to such a degree is not without precedent, but it is also not exactly common. Friday marked the 16th time that spread eclipsed 2 standard deviations for the first time in at least 3 months. Relative to those prior instances, the current overbought and oversold readings in both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are relatively middling. However, only the instance in early 2000 similarly saw the Nasdaq technically overbought (trading at least a standard deviation above its 50-DMA) while the S&amp;P 500 was simultaneously oversold (at least one standard deviation below its 50-DMA).  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 24th, 2023**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JnEIcSYZEM))**  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3/26/23**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; (*$CCL $BNTX $LULU $MU $IZEA $SKLZ $WBA $HTHT $FUTU $LOVE $RH $PAYX $IHS $GOEV $CALM $PLAY $RUM $CTAS $CNM $MKC $BB $EVGO $VERO $AUGX $RGF $GMDA $SNX $RAIL $AEHR $PVH $SRT $UGRO $AADI $PRGS $DNMR $NEOG $CONN $IMBI $SOL $LOV $GROY $EE $ABOS $CNXC $UNF $AMPS $JEF $ESLT $CURI $DARE*)  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/mconM20.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/B9lJ6yg.png))** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/kQxLMVP.png))**  *****  &gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).  &gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://charts.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&amp;p=d&amp;s=l))  *****  # DISCUSS!
