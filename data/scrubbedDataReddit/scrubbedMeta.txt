[UPDATE: YESTERDAYS META YOLO,;,; For those of you unfamiliar, yesterday I YOLOed my entire life savings on META options that expire this Friday.  Why?

META went through something similar, people hated the multiverse diversityverse? rick&amp;MortyVerse... And the stock drop spoke volumes. Zuck the cuck only needed to say he will make the year of efficiency, stopped a little bit investing in the metaverse and boom, stock soared.   If the CEO and the board members have at least 2 eye balls in their cranium, they will shift tactics pretty soon. They can't lose invetors money and trust.  What kind of shift investors might like? Investing in better writers, leave politics to the politics, stop remakes, hire star wars entusiasts, take their time to conjure a great movie (Darth Bane story) should do the kicker or maybe explore the past instead of continue with weak ideas post Originals.

Like, people are now talking like, it was kinda obvious to most, but if you looked at the discussions or were researching at the time, you would have been scared away from investing thinking, "are all these people wrong?", and one of the reasons I didn‚Äôt truly commit to investing in Meta, only put some money to see where things roll and sort of track the stock.

Price is $12 a pop so I bought 50.   Why it might go up.  * High open interest may mean that insiders know something, and the company could have news coming out (but why such a yolo number?!) * End of the year has a bit of tax harvesting and the January affect may cause stocks to start rising again at the start of the year (happened in 2023) * Option expiration January 19th may cause rise if people roll their protective puts (happened in 2023.) * Earnings at the end of the month may set up a floor. * Interest rate cuts may cause money to flow back into stocks, high beta large cap seeming the most lucrative.   Why it might go down  * already ran up 11% last month prior to earnings, could consolidate more. * lower VR sales than previous year.  * People worried about recession  * Bank Term Funding Program ending may collapse economy  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-12-29 17:04:27]

Companies don‚Äôt have extra budget for advertising as they used to, and it will dramatically affect meta‚Äôs earning. Based on my calculation, META fair share price is around $90/share. So it has 70% potential downside from its current inflated price. I believe they had manipulated last quarter earning to boost their stock price. This is illegal  and shameful.

[Your lotto play for META's earnings tonight,;,; Yesterday, I posted about MSFT's earnings [and anyone who listed banked hard]( The stock is up 8.5% today, calls up massively. My last earning post before that was last week with [Tesla]( which did extremely well too. Now we're looking to print more with META today. Who's ready?   The company will report its Q1 2023 earnings today after market close. The Facebook parent has been one of the greatest beneficiaries of tech's year-to-date rally, the company's stock climbing nearly fucking *70%* in 2023 ($124 -&gt; $211). The company's "year of efficiency" messaging and execution has resonated with shareholders (us), so the next question is ‚Äì can ol' Zucky keep it up?   Here's what analysts on Wall Street are expecting to see out of Meta:  * Revenue: $27.67 billion  * EPS: $2.01  * Advertising Revenue: $26.76 billion  * Family of Apps Revenue: $26.88 billion  * Reality Labs Operating Losses: $3.8 billion  I expect the stock to beat the consensus estimates of earnings and revenues. The company outperformed the street estimates in the last quarter, despite a 4% y-o-y drop in the total revenues to $32.17 billion. The top line primarily suffered due to lower advertising revenues. Notably, the average revenue per user was down on a year-on-year basis. That said, the daily active users improved in the quarter. I expect the Q1 result to be on similar lines.  Meta's "Year of Efficiency" has involved substantial cost-cutting at the company. In March, Meta announced it would lay off [10,000 workers]( building on the company's previous layoff announcement back in November, which affected [11,000 employees]( At the close of 2022, Meta had more than 80,000 employees. The impact of Meta‚Äôs cost-cutting initiatives such as reducing its headcount will be scrutinized.  A number of analysts are coming into this earnings cycle with substantial optimism about Meta's trajectory (including me). JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth currently has Meta at Overweight and raised his price target on March 24 for the company to $270 from $225, reiterating the company as a "top pick."  "Importantly, 2023 may be the 'Year of Efficiency,' but we believe Meta is building the critical muscle for financial discipline over the long term," he wrote in the March note. "Meta shares have more than doubled off their early November lows but we still think there‚Äôs meaningful upside ahead driven by accelerating revenue growth, continued cost efficiencies, and still attractive valuation."  However, challenges remain for Meta, as investors will look for improvement in the much-talked-about losses generated by the company's metaverse operation, Reality Labs, which lost a [whopping $13.7 billion in 2022]( Reality Labs is expected to report a loss of [$3.8 billion]( in the first quarter, up from a loss of $2.96 billion for the same period last year. However, this would be an improvement quarter-over-quarter, with Meta posting a $4.28 billion loss from Reality Labs in 4Q 2022.  Additionally, company watchers are hoping Meta can begin to leave the digital ad slowdown of the last year in its past. Early data indicates that, on the ad market front at least, there could be a light at the end of the tunnel. The decrease was due to a slight drop in advertising revenues, which suffered because of tough macroeconomic conditions. The same was evident from the ARPU figure for the year ‚Äì down 3% y-o-y. On the flip side, the DAUs increased by 4% y-o-y. I believe the Q1 results will follow the same trend.  "We think investors are cautiously optimistic on an improving digital ad market, while META has improved its cost structure and have given investors more confidence in management's commitment to profitability," wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black on April 24. "Recent ad checks indicated March ad spend was higher than anticipated and engagement data with Facebook and Instagram has been positive relative to peers."  So despite the Reality lab losses, I think META will beat estimates and will shoot up AH. So the play will be similar to MSFT, a call spread. I'll be getting META 4/28 215c and selling the 230c. This will cost $470, but can offer 3.2x gains if this goes our way.,;,; 2023-04-26 16:37:31]

[META Earnings Today, why not grab calls?,;,; Bullish on META ahead of Earnings  Meta Platforms (META) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q3 2023 results today. Last quarter, they kicked ass with 11% YoY revenue gains, hitting a cool $32 billion. Daily active users and ad impressions? Up 5% and 34%, respectively. But hold on‚Äîaverage price-per-ad fell 16% YoY. Expecting similar vibes this quarter, but what's the play?  Let's rewind a bit. META stock was a rollercoaster‚Äîup 15% from early 2021, sitting pretty at $310. But it wasn‚Äôt smooth sailing, folks. We saw +23% in 2021, a bloodbath of -64% in 2022, and then a moonshot of +156% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&amp;P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 10% in 2023 - indicating that META underperformed the S&amp;P in 2021 and 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&amp;P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for other heavyweights in the Communication Services sector including GOOG, NFLX, and CMCSA, and even for the megacap stars TSLA, MSFT, and AMZN. It's like they're playing catch up.  Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could META face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&amp;P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?  Well considering this year has been the 'year of efficiency' for Meta Platforms, with the company‚Äôs quarterly results in 2023 regularly bringing fireworks post-earnings. I'm certainly bullish. During the earnings, I will be interested in the company‚Äôs Reality Labs performance, a segment that includes Meta‚Äôs augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware, software, and content. The segment has come under scrutiny in the past following concerns about its profitability. However, analysts are expecting growth with this segment.  Any losses from it's virtual reality will be a drop in the bucket anyways as META's main money maker is advertising. So I'll also be watching for active user growth. Meta's ad growth is expected to spike 25% yoy in the third quarter and through 2024 with rising Reels engagement and monetization. However we should keep an eye on "paid social" as a new form of revenue (subscriptions).  Despite the details, I think it's worth getting a call for META before earnings. I'm going to grab META 10/24 320c @ 5.75. We would need a 6.5% increase to break even.,;,; 2023-10-25 19:15:26]

[PayPal Stock x Meta Stock Chart üìâüìà,;,; Meta (formerly Facebook) and PayPal, though operating in distinct domains, share several commonalities as prominent tech companies. Both entities are recognized as tech giants with a significant global presence. Meta, known for its focus on social media, virtual reality, and augmented reality, connects people worldwide through platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meanwhile, PayPal stands as a leading digital payments platform, facilitating secure online transactions on a global scale.  These companies demonstrate a commitment to digital innovation, each in their respective fields. Meta's ventures into virtual reality with Oculus and augmented reality showcase its dedication to pushing technological boundaries. Similarly, PayPal has pioneered online payment solutions, emphasizing the importance of seamless and secure digital transactions.  A user-centric approach is a shared characteristic, with both Meta and PayPal prioritizing user experience. Meta's goal is to foster global connections and communication, while PayPal focuses on providing a convenient and secure environment for digital payments, connecting buyers and sellers internationally.  Strategic acquisitions have played a key role in the expansion of both Meta and PayPal. Meta's acquisitions include Instagram and WhatsApp, augmenting its social technology portfolio. On the other hand, PayPal has strategically acquired companies such as Braintree and Venmo to enhance its digital payment offerings.  While these companies exhibit similarities in their global reach, commitment to innovation, user-centric focus, and strategic acquisitions, it's essential to recognize that their core businesses and industries diverge, with Meta primarily operating in the realm of social technology and PayPal specializing in digital payments.  Historically, Meta (formerly Facebook) and PayPal have exhibited similar stock trading patterns, influenced by broader factors in the technology sector. Commonalities arise from shared exposure to tech industry trends, general market sentiment, and macro-economic conditions. Investor behavior, including demographics and institutional ownership, contributes to parallel movements, as does the impact of competitive landscape changes on both companies. Earnings reports and performance metrics, such as revenue growth and profit margins, can lead to comparable stock reactions. Additionally, the global expansion of both Meta and PayPal, coupled with their reliance on technology adoption trends, further aligns their stock trajectories. While these broad factors contribute to historical similarities, comprehensive analysis considering specific company dynamics and evolving market conditions remains essential to understanding their individual stock behaviors.

I then posted about buying puts on Meta today, while encouraging everyone else to spend their life savings on calls and sure enough, it skyrocketed üöÄ  I now present to you‚Ä¶ Intel.   the stock is slightly overvalued at current levels. Because of the super slow PC market and more competition competeing with Intel‚Äôs data center business, Intel is now betting heavily on producing chips for other semiconductor companies. Not sure if this capital-intensive bet will pay off, especially considering Intel‚Äôs recent struggles with updating its chips to the latest process nodes. Intel stock is really only worth about $31 per share, 10% less than it is now. I doubt they‚Äôll have any substantial AI revenue guidance tomorrow either. I think they will beat earnings expectations tomorrow, but I will be buying puts before market close.   PLEASE, if you want to make some quick money, load up on all the calls you can get, because my inverse portfolio is literally a 100% success rate.

[Final Update: What happened after YOLOing my life savings.,;,; Appreciate everyone here who was rooting for me. It‚Äôs certainly been a wild ride. For those new here, I YOLOd my life savings of 38k into META calls on Tuesday that expire this Friday. I ended up selling my META calls yesterday for a 10k loss, then like a true regard YOLOd the rest into üïπÔ∏èüõë options that became near worthless overnight.  I currently have only 5k left from the original 38k. To make things worse, I woke up from my sleepless night to see that META rocketed this morning and if I had just held one more day I would‚Äôve been up to 140k at today‚Äôs peak.  After that crazy YOLO went as bad as it possibly could, I want to reiterate that I‚Äôll be alright financially - yes I lost like 90% of my life savings but I have no debt and some money in my checking account to live on while I‚Äôm working part-time and even a bit to cover any emergencies. I am only 20 years old and I still got time to set myself up financially (because of my ACT score I got a full ride to a private University so I don‚Äôt have any student loans. And yes, just because I‚Äôm academically smart doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm financially smart as you all can see üòÜ).  I‚Äôve always considered myself a workaholic and I almost never spend any money on things that I don‚Äôt need, so I amassed that money doing various jobs like fast food, food delivery, and internships whenever I had free time throughout my teenage years (saying this because some people were assuming this was my parents‚Äô money). It‚Äôs time to save up again and move on past this loss. I‚Äôm obviously not doing the greatest mentally but a few people have reached out which I really appreciate and I know it‚Äôll get better. Also, I think it‚Äôs important to note that I YOLOd the money with the mentally to take full responsibility and accept the loss no matter how severe. I‚Äôve always wanted to do something crazy and illogical and decided to just go for it. We only get one shot at life, why not do something insane? When I‚Äôm 80 I know I‚Äôll look back at this thinking of how much of an idiot I was but at the same time kind of glad that I wanted to do something so insane and had the balls to just go for it. You only live once, right? I hope this makes people feel better about their losses, and serves as a warning to those considering doing something as stupid as I did. Long live feta, and FUCK META ‚úåÔ∏è  Edit: Here are the links to my two original posts, the first is the META YOLO and the second is the regarded GME YOLO.  [  [  Second Edit: I forgot to mention that I dumped the remaining 5k into C3.ai calls. Please gamble responsibly!  Third Edit: As if it couldn‚Äôt get any worse, GME is now up, so I could‚Äôve recouped most of my losses from this morning if I held.

[Is Meta back?,;,; stock prices slid by almost -80% since Sep'21 till now.  Back then when it was citing challenges, going head-to-head with TikTok, Facebook's growth looks like it hit the ceiling already.  The sell-off was not isolated. Meta joined plenty of other tech stocks tanking during the sell-off.  But it suffered much more, as it is still languishing at a share price of USD 200 as of the time of writing.  &amp;#x200B;  But it has rebounded by 121% from its bottom back on the 4th of Nov'22.  So what triggered the rally?  First thing first, share buybacks.

The layoff of 10,000 employees back in November, will be met with an additional 10,000 employees.  The market cherishes cost-cutting for big stable companies.

[Why hasn't META taken advantage of the AI trend?,;,; I'm curious as to why Meta hasn't taken any steps to ride the hot-wave of AI and the AI war going on between MSFT and GOOG. As far as I'm aware, isn't Meta similarly positioned in terms of R&amp;D and AI technology? Are they purposely keeping it under wraps for whatever reason? If they disclosed they were also going to launch some kind of AI software to the public, I feel like a lot of people would realize how well-positioned they are in the field of AI, rather than being focused only on the metaverse, which has been a contentious topic for most. But I think AI on the other hand would fare quite well considering how people are crazed over it currently.  I sent this post as a prompt into ChatGPT, and this was its answer...  *Meta, formerly Facebook, has been investing heavily in AI research and development for several years. In fact, many of the most innovative and high-profile AI applications have been developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR), which is the company's dedicated AI research division. Some of FAIR's key contributions to the field of AI include advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning, among others.*  *However, Meta's strategy and priorities as a company are not solely focused on AI. While AI is certainly an important part of their technological arsenal, they have also been investing heavily in other areas such as virtual and augmented reality, as well as the Metaverse, which they see as the next major computing platform.*  *In terms of Meta's approach to disclosing their AI capabilities, it is worth noting that many of the most significant advances in AI are often kept under wraps until they are ready for commercial deployment. This is because the field of AI is highly competitive, and companies are often trying to gain a strategic advantage over their competitors. Additionally, there are also concerns around the potential ethical implications of AI, which may lead companies to be cautious about how they disclose their research.*  *Overall, while Meta is certainly a major player in the field of AI, they are also pursuing a wide range of other technological innovations, and it is likely that their AI research will continue to play an important but relatively quiet role in their broader strategy.*  Furthermore, I asked it about specifics of their AI R&amp;D and comparatively to their current competitive counterpart:  *Meta (formerly Facebook) has been investing heavily in AI research and development for several years, and their efforts have resulted in a number of high-profile applications and contributions to the field of AI. Here are a few examples:*  1. *Computer Vision: Meta's computer vision research has led to the development of a number of innovative applications, including automatic image and video captioning, face recognition, and object detection. One particularly noteworthy contribution is the development of the DeepMask and SharpMask algorithms, which are used for high-quality object segmentation in images.* 2. *Natural Language Processing: Meta has made significant progress in natural language processing (NLP) through its work on the Transformers architecture. Transformers is a deep learning model that has achieved state-of-the-art results in a variety of NLP tasks, including machine translation, question answering, and sentiment analysis.* 3. *Reinforcement Learning: Meta has also made important contributions to the field of reinforcement learning (RL), which involves training agents to make decisions based on rewards and punishments. Their RL research has led to the development of advanced algorithms for game playing and other tasks.*  *These are just a few examples of the many areas in which Meta has made important contributions to AI research. In terms of how they compare to other major players in the field, here are a few thoughts:*  * *OpenAI: Like Meta, OpenAI is a major player in the field of AI research, and has made important contributions in a variety of areas. However, OpenAI's focus is somewhat different, as they are specifically dedicated to advancing AI in a way that is safe and beneficial for humanity. This has led them to focus on areas such as reinforcement learning and generative models, as well as research into the potential societal implications of AI.* * *Microsoft: Microsoft is also heavily invested in AI research, and has made significant contributions in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. One notable example is the development of the GPT series of language models, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a variety of NLP tasks.* * *Google: Like Meta, Google has made important contributions to AI research in a wide range of areas. Some of their most notable contributions include the development of the TensorFlow machine learning framework, as well as advances in areas such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing.*  *Overall, all of these companies are major players in the field of AI research, and each brings unique strengths and perspectives to the table. Meta's research is notable for its focus on computer vision and NLP, as well as their work on the Metaverse and virtual reality.*  It would seem like just a matter of time before they announce something that directly or indirectly competes with Google and Microsoft too, maybe an avatar chatbot AI you can see in VR/AR? That would be pretty cool.  And from there you can quickly see where it would go. Immersive experiences with AI generated content:  I think one path of the AI and metaverse will be influencer and celebrity avatars powered by AI. Have you seen on Twitch, the AI streamers, which are based on the input of all of the footage and recorded videos of the streamer? It's fascinating what the implications are, but imagine you could meet your favorite Twitch streamer, or movie celebrity powered by AI in the metaverse.  In the future, you could let the AI watch a movie, like Star Wars, and it could recreate all the characters in the movie as AI avatars in the movie itself and you could enter into an immersive movie experience as an interactive movie game, all generated by AI.  You could become an avatar, in Avatar, or become Neo in the Matrix, lol.  Powered by Meta, of course.,;,; 2023-02-19 05:43:28]

($META), skyrocketing revenue, EPS explosions, and strategic moonshots that not even Elon could scoff at (poor guy dropped to 3 richest man ... sad). Here‚Äôs the TL;DR of Meta analysis:     * **Revenue Rocket Fuel:** Meta‚Äôs treasure chest overflowed with $40.11 billion in Q4, a 25% jump from 2022, while the full-year haul ascended to $134.90 billion, up by 16%. Zuck and Co. are printing money faster than the Fed, and we're here for it. * **Net Income Supernova:** The Q4 net income went supernova, soaring 201% to a whopping $14.02 billion. Over the year, it jumped 69% to $39.10 billion. Meta's EPS shot up 203% in Q4 to $5.33, with a yearly crescendo of 73% at $14.87.

[Facebook-parent Meta planning more layoffs, to impact thousands: Report,;,; Facebook-parent Meta Platforms is planning a fresh round of job cuts in a reorganization and downsizing effort that could affect thousands of workers, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday.  Meta plans to push some leaders into lower-level roles without direct reports, flattening the layers of management between top boss Mark Zuckerberg and the company's interns, the Washington Post reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.  In November last year, Meta said it had laid off 11,000 employees, a little over a tenth of its global workforce, days after Twitter let go of nearly half its workforce.  The company is also considering more traditional cuts, including slashing some projects and jobs. These efforts, targeted at divisions across the company and worldwide, may not happen on a single day, but will likely roll out in the coming months.  Zuckerberg proclaimed 2023 the ‚Äúyear of efficiency,‚Äù promising investors he would trim middle management and speed up the company‚Äôs decision-making, hinting at the possibility of more cuts.

[Elon Musk goes off on Disney CEO Bob Iger, says he should be 'fired immediately',;,; [  &amp;#x200B;  Elon Musk isn't letting up in his beef with Disney CEO Bob Iger.  The X boss trashed Iger on Thursday, [writing on X]( (formerly Twitter) that he should be "fired immediately" and that Walt Disney himself is "turning in his grave over what Bob has done to his company."  Musk pounced on news that New Mexico's attorney general had [sued Meta]( and its CEO ‚Äî and longtime Musk rival ‚Äî Mark Zuckerberg.  The lawsuit alleges that Meta's social networks aren't doing enough to protect kids and that Instagram and Facebook were "not safe spaces for children but rather prime locations for predators to trade child pornography and solicit minors for sex," according to AG Ra√∫l Torrez.  One user on X pointed out that Disney was still advertising on Meta; the company recently [pulled ads from X]( after Musk supported an [antisemitic post](  Musk [chimed in]( (misspelling the Disney CEO's name): "Bob Eiger thinks it's cool to advertise next to child exploitation material. Real stand up guy."  When another user asked why Iger hadn't been fired yet, Musk replied: "He should be fired immediately."  He also responded to a news headline about his call for Iger's firing with one word: "truth."  Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.  It's Musk's latest attack on an advertiser who fled his platform. At the New York Times' Dealbook summit, Musk had a succinct and vulgar response to companies that didn't want to give him money anymore: ["Go fuck yourself."](  At the event, Musk took the opportunity to single Iger out.  "Is that clear?" Musk asked. "I hope it is. Hey, Bob."  Earlier at the summit, the Disney CEO was asked about his company's decision to pull advertising on X.  "We know Elon is larger than life in many respects, and that his name is very much tied to the companies he either has founded or he owns, whether it's [Tesla]( or SpaceX or now X," Iger said.  Iger appeared to reference Musk's decision to boost an antisemitic tweet last month.  "By him taking the position that he took in quite a public manner, we just felt that the association with that position and Elon Musk and X was not necessarily a positive one for us," Iger said.  Musk faced an [onslaught of criticism]( over his post on X which called an antisemitic post the "absolute truth." Though, Musk later appeared to walk back his original comment, calling it "foolish."  Iger and Disney are one of many that Musk has taken aim at over the years. The billionaire has publicly dissed several major figures and companies, including [Apple ]( [President Joe Biden.]( 2023-12-07 18:06:41]

[Meta plans launch of AI bots with different personas in attempt to retain user,;,; Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) plans to launch a range of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots which exude different personalities as soon as September, in an attempt to bolster engagement with its social media platforms.  The company has been designing prototypes for chatbots which can have humanlike talks with its users, the report added citing people with knowledge of the matter.  The chatbots take the form of different characters. The tech giant is exploring a chatbot which talks like Abraham Lincoln and another that advises on travel options in the style of a surfer, the report noted.  The move comes amid Meta trying to focus on retaining users of its Twitter-rival text app Threads, as the platform lost more than half its users in the weeks following its launch on July 5.  Rival tech companies have already launched chatbots which feature personalities. Start-up  Character.ai valued at $1B, uses large language models (LLMs) to generate conversation in the style of personalities such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Nintendo character Mario, to name a few, according to the report.

[The Weekly M bearish pattern continues to play out‚Ä¶ 4-26-23 SPY/ ES Futures and VIX Daily Analysis (Bonus META Earnings),;,; For almost a month now I have been talking about this cup and handle that has been attempting to form‚Ä¶ we officially are finally doing it‚Ä¶   &amp;#x200B;    This cup and handle is playing out beautifully which gives us a soft target of 402.6 for EOW. However, I continue to see a bigger downside target of 399.   &amp;#x200B;    While some say TA doesn‚Äôt work and that its all fake‚Ä¶ analyzing the past can be predictive of the future‚Ä¶ this is as of now playing out perfectly for the weekly close back under 407.3 which should start the next bigger leg down.   **Calendar**  &amp;#x200B;    Tomorrow we get more jobless data and GDP‚Ä¶ currently the alantafed nowcasts says GDP is going to take a huge hit tomorrow. If we take a huge hit GDP like that that could put us back on the path to see a recession by the EOY.   **META Earnings**  &amp;#x200B;    We are seeing a ‚Äúbeat‚Äù on META but if you read between the lines‚Ä¶ this forward guidance is real dog water if you ask me.   Im starting to remember why I just as a blanket statement refuse to play earnings‚Ä¶ at least it was a small lotto and about 30% of it paid for when I repositioned.   **SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**   &amp;#x200B;    On a daily timeframe here we did have a 405.17 supply that we did come down to finally take out. We have officially cleared out all the supplies that were left down below except for one at 399.07‚Ä¶ for me until we establish a new demand (support) my target will remain at 399.07.   **SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**  &amp;#x200B;    One thing that I said I was looking for today was a bounce and retest of the daily 20ema‚Ä¶ I actually expected us to put in a green day but instead we actually tested it and hard rejected and closed under critical support of 405.2‚Ä¶ Now that we have closed under 405.2 we have a very clear move down to 399 and possibly 390.. the thing to know about SPY is that it is very consistent with its channels. What I mean is SPY likes its ranges‚Ä¶ now that we have fallen out of the 405.2 to 420 range we should start re-considering the 390 to 405.2 range.   We did come down and tested the daily 50ema support but held over that. Tomorrow my target is 399 which will get us under the daily 100/ 200ema‚Ä¶ Historically speaking SPY does not like to move through the 200ema whether bullishly or bearishly without a fight. Meaning that when we do get to the 200ema that likely will be our bounce area and 399 is where I play to take profits on my 86dte 408P.   We have officially started a resistance line down and will keep a close eye on that along with 405.2 and the daily 20ema.   The question now is can this META ‚Äúbeat‚Äù actually hold SPY up‚Ä¶ because clearly google and MSFT couldn‚Äôt.   SPY Daily Levels    Supply- 399.1 -&gt; 412.6    Demand- 395.6 -&gt; 406.6 -&gt; 409.2    Support- 404.3 -&gt; 401.4 -&gt; 399.8    Resistance- 405.2 -&gt; 406.8 -&gt; 409.1  **FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**   &amp;#x200B;    Futures confirmed the 4117 as resistance (not a new supply just back tested and held as resistance) and here we are seeing a push down to 4040/4055 supply to take those levels out. I remain bearish and until a new demand (support) is established our target should be this 4040/4055 supply.   **FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**  &amp;#x200B;    Futures is set attempting to hold this 4081 support line after hours. However, now that we have a clear cut back test of the daily 20ema and closure under the 4095 critical support level‚Ä¶ my downside target remains 4040/4055 which would be exactly touching the daily 100/200ema. There is potential of a bigger sell off down to 3920 but I would expect that to come post FOMC.   Daily Futures Level    Supply- 4040 -&gt; 4055    Demand- 4005 -&gt; 4117    Support- 4081 -&gt; 4055 -&gt; 4040    Resistance-4095 -&gt; 4110 -&gt; 4138  **VIX**  &amp;#x200B;    The VIX is a little hard to read here today‚Ä¶ so on one hand we have a really clear and nice v bottom and we despite the doji candle did bounce to retest the daily 8ema support and closed over the daily 20ema for the 2nd time in a row‚Ä¶ we have not done that since March 17th/ 20th. However, one could absolutely see this daily doji candle as a evening doji star reversal.   The VIX clearly has been reacting to the FRC news and the markets are starting to finally accept some of bearishness that is ahead. GDP tomorrow morning will be incredibly interesting to see if markets start to price in a recession or not.   **DAILY TRADING LOG**  &amp;#x200B;    I absolutely struggled this morning. The volatility of opening hours was some of the highest (realized not relative) that I have seen in a while). Premiums were moving so fast it was nearly impossible to get filled and by time I did fill it seemed that we were immediately reversing. I have not had so many stop losses immediately hit in a very long time as I did today.   Thankfully the 2nd half of the day I was really able to capitalize on price action and make it back and then some. Currently (even with my small lotto meta loss) im already over my weekly goal. With two days to go this week I look forward to putting in another profitable week.   The hardest thing I struggle with lately is that at times I am noticing price action pushing through technical. There are a lot of times that I find myself missing the move as the technical never fully reset from say bearish to bullish to take a call‚Ä¶ and there are other times it does reset and then it‚Äôs a fake out.   However, the one thing I will say and I have said all of last year too is that capital preservation and risk management is the key to success‚Ä¶ for instance at one point this morning was down about a full days profit goal‚Ä¶ instead of revenge trading (despite getting frustrated at price action) I stuck to my rules, respected my stop losses and waited for my time to make some money. Its not always straight green and its not always easy trading every day. But no matter how good or bad of a day we are having/ have had we have to respect our strategy and our rules.   Risk management will always be the key to long term success and profitability.,;,; 2023-04-26 20:39:24]

[Nvidia chases $30 billion custom chip market with new unit,;,; Nvidia NVDA  is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for  cloud computing firms and others, including advanced artificial  intelligence processors, according to nine sources familiar with the  company's plans.  The dominant global designer and  supplier of AI chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market  for custom AI chips and to protect itself from the growing number of  companies interested in finding alternatives to its products.  The  Santa Clara, California-based company currently controls about 80% of  the market for high-end AI chips, a position that has sent its market  value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than  tripled in 2023.  Its customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOG and Meta Platforms META, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of Nvidia chips to compete in the rapidly emerging generative AI sector.  Nvidia's  H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor  for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started  to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps  reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time  to design.  Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in  helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to  rival firms such as Broadcom AVGO and Marvell Technology MRVL, according to the sources who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  "If  you're really trying to optimize on things like power, or optimize on  cost for your application, you can't afford to go drop an H100 or A100  in there," Greg Reichow, general partner at venture capital firm Eclipse  Ventures said in an interview. "You want to have the exact right  mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need."  Nvidia does not disclose H100 prices, which are higher than for the  prior-generation A100, but each chip can sell from $16,000 to $100,000  depending on the volume purchased and other factors. Meta has said it  plans to bring its total stock to 350,000 H100s this year.  Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon .com AMZN,  Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for  them, according to two sources familiar with the meetings. Beyond data  center chips, the company has pursued telecom, automotive and video game  customers.  In 2022, Nvidia said it would let  third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking  technology with their own chips. The company has said nothing about the  program since, and Reuters is reporting its wider ambitions for the  first time.  A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company's 2022 announcement.  Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices AMD  and Marvell executive, heads Nvidia's custom unit and her team's goal  is to make its technology available for customers in cloud, 5G wireless,  video games and automotives, according to a LinkedIn profile. Those  mentions were scrubbed and her title was changed after Reuters sought  comment from Nvidia.  Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment.  $30 BILLION MARKET  According  to estimates from research firm 650 Group‚Äôs Alan Weckel, the data  center custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year,  and double that in 2025.  The broader custom chip market  was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023, which amounts to roughly 5% of  annual global chip sales, according to Needham analyst Charles Shi.  Currently, custom silicon design for data centers is dominated by Broadcom and Marvell.  In  a typical arrangement, a design partner such as Nvidia would offer  intellectual property and technology, but leave the chip fabrication,  packaging and additional steps to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  2330 or another contract chip manufacturer.  Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales.  "With  Broadcom's custom silicon business touching $10 billion, and Marvell‚Äôs  around $2 billion, this is a real threat," said Dylan Patel, founder of  the silicon research group SemiAnalysis. "It's a real big negative -  there's more competition entering the fray."  BEYOND AI  Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson 61QS  for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics  processing unit (GPU) technology, according to two sources familiar with  the talks.  650 Group's Weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year.  Ericsson declined to comment.  Nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video game markets, according to sources and public social media postings.  Weckel  expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6  billion to $8 billion range at 20% a year, and the $7 billion to $8  billion video game custom chip market could increase with the  next-generation consoles from Xbox and Sony 6857.  Nintendo‚Äôs  current Switch handheld console already includes an Nvidia chip, the  Tegra X1. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is  likely to include a Nvidia custom design, according to one source.  Nintendo declined to comment.  &amp;#x200B;  \- Reuters,;,; 2024-02-09 13:25:56]
[BIG WEEK AHEAD,;,; We have Fed speak and six significant earnings reports with forward guidance this coming week.  My thoughts:  JPOW &amp; Committee has no reason at all to do six rate cuts this year so far.  Too bad - the economy would boom otherwise.  He won‚Äôt declare victory and most likely will remain cautious.  I think the market needs to get over the Fed and move on.      Tuesday the fun begins:  MSFT -  red hot!   The tunes are full blast - can they dance?   They have three businesses to report on plus AI.  Microsoft 365, Asure cloud, &amp; personal computing- XBOX, Bing, Surface, and Activision.  Their yoy earnings is expected to increase 19%.  They been pushing AI close to two years now - show me the money!  Would like to see  yoy revenue growth of at least 25% based on their price. I think they are over bought.    GOOGL -  is expected to grow earnings by 53% to roughly $ 1.61.  Let‚Äôs see how search and YouTube does.  Maybe they have a new AI story to tell.  Over bought I think.     AMD -  is expected to grow earnings by 12% to roughly $0.77.   It‚Äôll be about forward guidance I believe.   I like what I hear about the 8000G processors with lower power graphics and innovative content creation capabilities.   They have a strong story as well with their neural processing unit(NPU) Ryzen A for PC‚Äôs. Over bought but will continue to kick ass I think.  Thursday:  AAPL - is expected to grow earnings 12% with flat yoy revenue.  Really don‚Äôt see any surprise to the upside.  Heard the Apple Pro Vision isn‚Äôt gaining any app‚Äôs on Netflix‚Äôs.    Really no growth story so far.  Sell.   AMZN -big Q upcoming.   They need to demonstrate they can make big money.  They are expected to grow earnings from $0.03 to 0.79/share.  Use them a lot - we‚Äôll see.  Meta - expected to grow earnings by 66% to $5 roughly.  Meta plans to have 350,000 Nvidia H100 chips to drive its data centers &amp; AI by end of 2024. Year of efficiency is over I think.     I‚Äôm hoping for a flat week, but do have puts on MSFT &amp; APPL.   My opinion only.   Your thoughts!,;,; 2024-01-28 05:28:20]

[$875 - $490k in 2 months,;,; Hello fellow regards.  I am the degen regard with the $52k MSFT calls (sold for 160k).  Everyone has been asking, so i will give the full story the best i can and to the point. Loss &amp; gain porn and dopamine highly fluctuated recently.  Screenshots showing starting, all time low, and currently. (Robinhood fked up and doesnt show %, and shows -37k instead of 875 cause theres a 38k withdrawl from yesterday pending).  TLDR: I gambled my life savings during the last 2 years, going from $217k account to just $875 2 months ago, gained 56,000% since then, currently at 490k. Im 26yr old.  2017 - Feb, 7 2021: Starting investing with robinhood in 2017 and would deposit money pretty often, learned about options (shocker) and hit a high of 274k in Feb of 2021 (total deposits 217k).  2021 - March 20, 2023: Trading options, meme stocks,  and tech earnings led to me losing more than 99% of my account by March 20. I actually had $375 and deposited $500 that day.   March 20 - Today Began trading 0DTE QQQs and weekly AMZN and TSLA swings both calls and puts.  Yesterday i bought like 200k worth of QQQ weekly calls and 100 MSFT 280 calls ($60k) in the morning to cash on the earnings run up and sell before close, because i promised i wouldnt play earnings again (shocker #2)... Anyway i was down 34% and decided to sell.. i put in the order and only 12 calls sold, i canceled it and decided to ride earnings overnight. Woke up and sold it for $160k after market and sold the QQQ calls, account was 458k when i sold.  Right after selling i bought $10k META puts to play earnings and i bought over $275k of 3DTE and weekly QQQ Puts. My account is sitting at 506k now, running up over 57,800% since March 20, 2023.  Bottom line: Im regarded, and i got lucky asf. Dont go trying to chase a $ without expecting to lose it all.

[Last Two Days Explained: Bears Lose,;,; It has been quite some time since I have posted here, lets see how shitty it still is.   Yesterday bears were winning, they had had strung together 5-6 days in a row after Powell said "no. no. no I wouldn't say that" in response to a Reuters reporter asking "is a soft landing your base case?"      Then the SEP (I know many don't know or track this) shows in his fancy power point slides that we should be at 5% all of 2024 - ouch. Higher for longer represented officially for the first time - much higher for longer than the market had expected. Specifically the market was thinking "the fed MUST be done soon, remember Aug 17th when bad news = good news and we rallied off the recent low? Our economy is shit, unemployment is going higher, GDP is slowing, so that means FED cuts are coming!" and the bulls piled in. Everyone like Tom Lee saying "new highs by end of the year!"      Well that lasted only so long, and Powell all but killed the bulls after his recent FOMC speech and his quite "hawkish pause" locking in expectations for higher for longer.      Since then, 10YR and 30YR have been ripping. Oil has been ripping. Dollar has been ripping. JPY/USD had been falling. China has been Falling.      \^\^ this is all super bearish.      So what do professionals and even retail do? They go short. They buy puts. They sell calls. Funds unwind their long leverage... and... markets sell off.      On Wednesday the trend continues down, right to about to levels where we bounced on Aug 17th. Around 2pm EST Zuck takes the stage at his shit conference. The man doubles down on Quest, AR, VR, Metaverse style ideas and the market hates it... META drops about 3% in 30 minutes. Keep in mind, Quest sales have been declining and that META's hardware department loses 17B of its 35B in operating profit. So... META makes 35B each year lets say, and they throw 17B at hardware/metaverse/AR/Glasses/Goggles/Joysticks and legless avatars.      The man is on stage talking about how we can all use MSFT products in our work meetings in the AR Metaverse. Yawn.      Market hates it.      Real quick tho - can you imagine seeing a human being in those Ray Ban glasses with a fucking camera pointed at you? Walking around in public somewhere livestreaming their worthless lives? Maybe its just me but who has the balls to do that? Is it even legal in most places - and regardless one MAGA guy is going to yank them off your face and destroy them. Doesn't that just self identify you as a follower of Zuckerberg - or a Facebook boomer? God I just personally hate the whole thing.      Moving on.      Zuck then quickly moves on and starts saying the magic word: AI.      Keep in mind, the market is now down about .8% at this point and META is down 3.5%. All the bears, across all tech, are basically now seeing the market hit those levels and they have a lot of gains. Puts get closed, shorts get covered. That leads to buying...      Simultaneously Zuck says AI 5 more times and... retail starts buying, or closing shorts, or both - who cares. But a bottom forms and the squeeze is on. Zuck mentions MSFT, AMZN and NVDA over the course of 15 minutes and the magnificent 7 just start rallying and squeezing higher and higher. Week hands get liquidated, others cover their shorts before its too late and SPY/QQQ print a vertical green line for about 1.5 hours straight. Pretty cool for the bulls, total shit for the bears.      Now the sentiment is shifting a bit... fintwit and reddit and the BTFD crowd say in unison "told you, stonks only go up!" And confidence builds. The rally continues - a nice one actually.      Overnight futures drift higher and everything seems well until... more bad news... Government revises GDP and consumer spending numbers. GDP is reduced an consumer spending is reduced.      Economy worse, people spending less. SUPER BULLISH remember? Bad news is good news because it means the FED is done right? It's getting what it wants, the economy is slowing and people are broke again. YES! BUY BUY BUY      So in the AM the markets find their bottom on this report as soon as the market opens and dumbasses can trade options again. Puts get closed, calls get bought, VIX gets crushed. BULLISH! The rally continues cause bad news = good news.      And that brings us to the PCE report tomorrow AM. Well... if GOV reduced consumer spending lower that means, most likely, consumer spending will come in lower again tomorrow in the report. People are spending even less! Awesome! BULLISH!      People front run it, getting calls in expectation that PCE comes in "cooler" tomorrow - which it probably will. If PCE comes in cool tomorrow, expect another "August 17th style bounce" and the bulls to be in control again for a while.   Thats all I got.      &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-09-28 22:23:35]

[Three large cap stocks currently in value territory,;,; I‚Äôll keep this short and simple. So many of y‚Äôall seem to fall for the stock market gambit of buying overpriced companies over and over again. Case in point, kudos to anyone who bought $META at $90 in November. It was in deep value territory with tons of negative sentiment. Now after a 200% rally, it‚Äôs constantly recommended on forums, despite the rich valuation. Most people missed buying it when it was cheap and are now piling in when it‚Äôs expensive.  My goal is to find similarly beaten up stocks which have asymmetric risk and a high chance of big payout. The three names I‚Äôve taken a position in are PayPal, 3M, and Alibaba.  Forward PE of all three companies are ridiculously low in their respective industries:  PayPal: 12  3M: 11  Alibaba: 9  All while return on invested capital and margins are quite high for their industries. Share buybacks are increasing for all of them as well, which is a fantastic sign when they are trading significantly cheaper than their peers.  I‚Äôm not going to go over every detail of the financials or business, but similar to meta, there‚Äôs very little reason for any of them to have dropped this much other than overblown media hit pieces. They‚Äôre financially sound companies.   Would love to hear other viewpoints that think there‚Äôs room to gap lower.   TLDR: PYPL &lt; $60, MMM &lt; $100 and BABA &lt; $80 have a lot of value potential imo and are worth a deeper look for anyone interested in making money.,;,; 2023-05-30 22:55:31]

[Why I don't think NVDA party gonna last,;,; I know I know - you all think NVDA can reach higher than the sky, but here is why I say they don't. In fact, here is why I say they have already outburnt their rocket!   Look at the list below.    there are only 5 companies at the $1T club, and number 6 and 7 are fighting their asses off to get in. now lets talk about ALL of them, and why NVDA isn't one of them:     1. MSFT has just this week gained supremacy and passed AAPL. There's no argue why MSFT is one of the top 5 companies in the world. They control more than 60% of all OS on all computers on the entire planet, they have access to us all with their products, and they control 22% of could services world wide with Azure. billions of users world wide uses products they 100% own, and profit of with no middleman anywhere. That's dominancy! That's not talking about LinkedIn which is considered to be the best professional social network, and they sure as fuck monetize this. 2. AAPL since they dropped Intel's processors for the M1 and later M2, they control end-to-end of their production process and have roughly 50% market share of wealthy users world wide, plus 26% of mobile users globally. Not sure if they truly invented it, but they have perfected the subscription profit model, and controlling the spending of their huge users base fiercely! And I bet there's a hidden report out there showing they control the majority of the top dome of socio-economic group. BTW a friend of mine working as senior full stack at MSFT told me they gave him a MacBook when he started working for Microsoft. He's developing MS-Office on a MacBook!!!!!  3. Saudi-Aramco - I know shit about them, but they control oceans of oil and you know.... oil is oil 4. Google - 98% market share for online searches. plus, over 70% global market share of mobile OS and 12% share of  cloud service. All in-house and 100% owned by Google. Oh yeah, and don't forget about Youtube. Oh BTW - do you drive much? did you know that to avoid competition, Google bought Waze too? 5. AMZN - Well to be honest, I don't believe they have a strong valuable market place anymore and I am pessimistic about their retailing now days. In fact I heard somewhere (and I can't find it now) that they lost almost $10B on their forward sellings in 2022, BUT!!!! they earned over $20B off advertising on site which covers the returns and customer's care. we can argue about that, but we can't argue about the crown jewel of AMZN - AWS!!!! 33% of all data on could, is located on an AWS server. You know NFLX, DIS, and WBD streaming services? Along with Amazon prime, they are all located on the same fucking servers!!!! In fact, unless you're watching Youtube or AppleTV, if you're watching streamers, you're watching it off an AWS server!  6. NVDA - let's roll back to it later 7. Meta - I do hate that evil empire, but there's no argue that there's no other company with as much user data as they have. Between Instagram, Facebook, whatsapp - if you want to talk or meet someone, it's probably through one of their platforms, and they monitor it. 8. Tesla - I hate Elon! I think he should be in jail for violating at least 10 SEC regulations. But he's still out there and roaming. I won't argue that TSLA is A-Z solution to car manufacturing. Everything is In-house as well, and the marketing expenses are 0!!! But in a world where everybody are looking for autonomous vehicles, Elon's got the most data collected in the world. When they talked about creating a center control for autonomous driving, they suggested Tesla will be the center since they have the biggest data centers dedicated for it.   &amp;#x200B;  Now lets get back to NVDA - 10 years ago, they were nothing. A great product for a special segment of hardcore computer users willing to spend $200-$500 on hardware no one else even knows needed.   Back then Intel was God and AMD tried biting on them. But got no where close.    Then AI kicked in, and engineers found out GPU are better to teach the modules rather than CPU and guess who's the best GPU manufacturer? wait no!!! It's not NVDA! They have never manufactured a single processor. They don't have a single factory. They do it all with TSMC (number 11 on the list, but around 1/3 the value on NVDA).   Ok so they have the best design. Fuck!!! no they don't!! They use ARM technology to design their processors ($74B market cap). And why ARM are so important? well because couple months ago, NVDA wanted to buy them, so the US regulator looked this deal up, and found out these 2 companies are the only 2 companies to design such technologies and by buying them, NVDA will basically eliminate the competition, and be a full monopoly on ARM architecture processors. so how come one company is worth $74B and the other $1.4T??? because they design the best AI training processors.  WAIT!!!! FUCK they don't!!!!! haven't you heard?? AMD just steamrolled them with Frontier ([     AMD has had the best week in their life!! how good? $250B good. That's still 1/6 of NVDA.   And wait, I mentioned Intel several times before, but what's the deal with them? Well in a nut shell, they have dragged behind. They used to have an enormous market share of processors in the market and they got cocky and neglected R&amp;D while the rest rushed to innovate. But even though you are probably reading this on an Intel based computer, or have one at work/home, and they used to be the sole suppliers for Apple computers, Intel at it's peak was worth $273B (Jan 31st 2020). Still fraction of NVDA's worth. And in opposed to NVDA, ARM and AMD - Intel has always owned their own factories, meaning their worth should combine NVDA and TSMC together!!!!  So the question remains - WTF??????       &amp;#x200B;   2024-01-18 18:27:58]

[Elon Musk goes off on Disney CEO Bob Iger, says he should be 'fired immediately',;,; [  &amp;#x200B;  Elon Musk isn't letting up in his beef with Disney CEO Bob Iger.  The X boss trashed Iger on Thursday, [writing on X]( (formerly Twitter) that he should be "fired immediately" and that Walt Disney himself is "turning in his grave over what Bob has done to his company."  Musk pounced on news that New Mexico's attorney general had [sued Meta]( and its CEO ‚Äî and longtime Musk rival ‚Äî Mark Zuckerberg.  The lawsuit alleges that Meta's social networks aren't doing enough to protect kids and that Instagram and Facebook were "not safe spaces for children but rather prime locations for predators to trade child pornography and solicit minors for sex," according to AG Ra√∫l Torrez.  One user on X pointed out that Disney was still advertising on Meta; the company recently [pulled ads from X]( after Musk supported an [antisemitic post](  Musk [chimed in]( (misspelling the Disney CEO's name): "Bob Eiger thinks it's cool to advertise next to child exploitation material. Real stand up guy."  When another user asked why Iger hadn't been fired yet, Musk replied: "He should be fired immediately."  He also responded to a news headline about his call for Iger's firing with one word: "truth."  Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.  It's Musk's latest attack on an advertiser who fled his platform. At the New York Times' Dealbook summit, Musk had a succinct and vulgar response to companies that didn't want to give him money anymore: ["Go fuck yourself."](  At the event, Musk took the opportunity to single Iger out.  "Is that clear?" Musk asked. "I hope it is. Hey, Bob."  Earlier at the summit, the Disney CEO was asked about his company's decision to pull advertising on X.  "We know Elon is larger than life in many respects, and that his name is very much tied to the companies he either has founded or he owns, whether it's [Tesla]( or SpaceX or now X," Iger said.  Iger appeared to reference Musk's decision to boost an antisemitic tweet last month.  "By him taking the position that he took in quite a public manner, we just felt that the association with that position and Elon Musk and X was not necessarily a positive one for us," Iger said.  Musk faced an [onslaught of criticism]( over his post on X which called an antisemitic post the "absolute truth." Though, Musk later appeared to walk back his original comment, calling it "foolish."  Iger and Disney are one of many that Musk has taken aim at over the years.

[META Earnings Today, why not grab calls?,;,; Bullish on META ahead of Earnings  Meta Platforms (META) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q3 2023 results today. Last quarter, they kicked ass with 11% YoY revenue gains, hitting a cool $32 billion. Daily active users and ad impressions? Up 5% and 34%, respectively. But hold on‚Äîaverage price-per-ad fell 16% YoY. Expecting similar vibes this quarter, but what's the play?  Let's rewind a bit. META stock was a rollercoaster‚Äîup 15% from early 2021, sitting pretty at $310. But it wasn‚Äôt smooth sailing, folks. We saw +23% in 2021, a bloodbath of -64% in 2022, and then a moonshot of +156% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&amp;P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 10% in 2023 - indicating that META underperformed the S&amp;P in 2021 and 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&amp;P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for other heavyweights in the Communication Services sector including GOOG, NFLX, and CMCSA, and even for the megacap stars TSLA, MSFT, and AMZN. It's like they're playing catch up.  Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could META face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&amp;P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?  Well considering this year has been the 'year of efficiency' for Meta Platforms, with the company‚Äôs quarterly results in 2023 regularly bringing fireworks post-earnings. I'm certainly bullish. During the earnings, I will be interested in the company‚Äôs Reality Labs performance, a segment that includes Meta‚Äôs augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware, software, and content. The segment has come under scrutiny in the past following concerns about its profitability. However, analysts are expecting growth with this segment.  Any losses from it's virtual reality will be a drop in the bucket anyways as META's main money maker is advertising. So I'll also be watching for active user growth. Meta's ad growth is expected to spike 25% yoy in the third quarter and through 2024 with rising Reels engagement and monetization. However we should keep an eye on "paid social" as a new form of revenue (subscriptions).  Despite the details, I think it's worth getting a call for META before earnings. I'm going to grab META 10/24 320c @ 5.75. We would need a 6.5% increase to break even.,;,; 2023-10-25 19:15:26]

[Meta plans launch of AI bots with different personas in attempt to retain user,;,; Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) plans to launch a range of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots which exude different personalities as soon as September, in an attempt to bolster engagement with its social media platforms.  The company has been designing prototypes for chatbots which can have humanlike talks with its users, the report added citing people with knowledge of the matter.  The chatbots take the form of different characters. The tech giant is exploring a chatbot which talks like Abraham Lincoln and another that advises on travel options in the style of a surfer, the report noted.  The move comes amid Meta trying to focus on retaining users of its Twitter-rival text app Threads, as the platform lost more than half its users in the weeks following its launch on July 5.  Rival tech companies have already launched chatbots which feature personalities. Start-up  Character.ai valued at $1B, uses large language models (LLMs) to generate conversation in the style of personalities such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Nintendo character Mario, to name a few, according to the report.

[PayPal Stock x Meta Stock Chart üìâüìà,;,; Meta (formerly Facebook) and PayPal, though operating in distinct domains, share several commonalities as prominent tech companies. Both entities are recognized as tech giants with a significant global presence. Meta, known for its focus on social media, virtual reality, and augmented reality, connects people worldwide through platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Meanwhile, PayPal stands as a leading digital payments platform, facilitating secure online transactions on a global scale.  These companies demonstrate a commitment to digital innovation, each in their respective fields. Meta's ventures into virtual reality with Oculus and augmented reality showcase its dedication to pushing technological boundaries. Similarly, PayPal has pioneered online payment solutions, emphasizing the importance of seamless and secure digital transactions.  A user-centric approach is a shared characteristic, with both Meta and PayPal prioritizing user experience. Meta's goal is to foster global connections and communication, while PayPal focuses on providing a convenient and secure environment for digital payments, connecting buyers and sellers internationally.  Strategic acquisitions have played a key role in the expansion of both Meta and PayPal. Meta's acquisitions include Instagram and WhatsApp, augmenting its social technology portfolio. On the other hand, PayPal has strategically acquired companies such as Braintree and Venmo to enhance its digital payment offerings.  While these companies exhibit similarities in their global reach, commitment to innovation, user-centric focus, and strategic acquisitions, it's essential to recognize that their core businesses and industries diverge, with Meta primarily operating in the realm of social technology and PayPal specializing in digital payments.  Historically, Meta (formerly Facebook) and PayPal have exhibited similar stock trading patterns, influenced by broader factors in the technology sector. Commonalities arise from shared exposure to tech industry trends, general market sentiment, and macro-economic conditions. Investor behavior, including demographics and institutional ownership, contributes to parallel movements, as does the impact of competitive landscape changes on both companies. Earnings reports and performance metrics, such as revenue growth and profit margins, can lead to comparable stock reactions. Additionally, the global expansion of both Meta and PayPal, coupled with their reliance on technology adoption trends, further aligns their stock trajectories. While these broad factors contribute to historical similarities, comprehensive analysis considering specific company dynamics and evolving market conditions remains essential to understanding their individual stock behaviors.

[Nvidia chases $30 billion custom chip market with new unit,;,; Nvidia NVDA  is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for  cloud computing firms and others, including advanced artificial  intelligence processors, according to nine sources familiar with the  company's plans.  The dominant global designer and  supplier of AI chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market  for custom AI chips and to protect itself from the growing number of  companies interested in finding alternatives to its products.  The  Santa Clara, California-based company currently controls about 80% of  the market for high-end AI chips, a position that has sent its market  value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than  tripled in 2023.  Its customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOG and Meta Platforms META, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of Nvidia chips to compete in the rapidly emerging generative AI sector.  Nvidia's  H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor  for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started  to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps  reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time  to design.  Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in  helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to  rival firms such as Broadcom AVGO and Marvell Technology MRVL, according to the sources who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  "If  you're really trying to optimize on things like power, or optimize on  cost for your application, you can't afford to go drop an H100 or A100  in there," Greg Reichow, general partner at venture capital firm Eclipse  Ventures said in an interview. "You want to have the exact right  mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need."  Nvidia does not disclose H100 prices, which are higher than for the  prior-generation A100, but each chip can sell from $16,000 to $100,000  depending on the volume purchased and other factors. Meta has said it  plans to bring its total stock to 350,000 H100s this year.  Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon .com AMZN,  Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for  them, according to two sources familiar with the meetings. Beyond data  center chips, the company has pursued telecom, automotive and video game  customers.  In 2022, Nvidia said it would let  third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking  technology with their own chips. The company has said nothing about the  program since, and Reuters is reporting its wider ambitions for the  first time.  A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company's 2022 announcement.  Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices AMD  and Marvell executive, heads Nvidia's custom unit and her team's goal  is to make its technology available for customers in cloud, 5G wireless,  video games and automotives, according to a LinkedIn profile. Those  mentions were scrubbed and her title was changed after Reuters sought  comment from Nvidia.  Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment.  $30 BILLION MARKET  According  to estimates from research firm 650 Group‚Äôs Alan Weckel, the data  center custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year,  and double that in 2025.  The broader custom chip market  was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023, which amounts to roughly 5% of  annual global chip sales, according to Needham analyst Charles Shi.  Currently, custom silicon design for data centers is dominated by Broadcom and Marvell.  In  a typical arrangement, a design partner such as Nvidia would offer  intellectual property and technology, but leave the chip fabrication,  packaging and additional steps to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.  2330 or another contract chip manufacturer.  Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales.  "With  Broadcom's custom silicon business touching $10 billion, and Marvell‚Äôs  around $2 billion, this is a real threat," said Dylan Patel, founder of  the silicon research group SemiAnalysis. "It's a real big negative -  there's more competition entering the fray."  BEYOND AI  Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson 61QS  for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics  processing unit (GPU) technology, according to two sources familiar with  the talks.  650 Group's Weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year.  Ericsson declined to comment.  Nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video game markets, according to sources and public social media postings.  Weckel  expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6  billion to $8 billion range at 20% a year, and the $7 billion to $8  billion video game custom chip market could increase with the  next-generation consoles from Xbox and Sony 6857.  Nintendo‚Äôs  current Switch handheld console already includes an Nvidia chip, the  Tegra X1. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is  likely to include a Nvidia custom design, according to one source.

[Why I don't think NVDA party gonna last,;,; I know I know - you all think NVDA can reach higher than the sky, but here is why I say they don't. In fact, here is why I say they have already outburnt their rocket!   Look at the list below.    there are only 5 companies at the $1T club, and number 6 and 7 are fighting their asses off to get in. now lets talk about ALL of them, and why NVDA isn't one of them:     1. MSFT has just this week gained supremacy and passed AAPL. There's no argue why MSFT is one of the top 5 companies in the world. They control more than 60% of all OS on all computers on the entire planet, they have access to us all with their products, and they control 22% of could services world wide with Azure. billions of users world wide uses products they 100% own, and profit of with no middleman anywhere. That's dominancy! That's not talking about LinkedIn which is considered to be the best professional social network, and they sure as fuck monetize this. 2. AAPL since they dropped Intel's processors for the M1 and later M2, they control end-to-end of their production process and have roughly 50% market share of wealthy users world wide, plus 26% of mobile users globally. Not sure if they truly invented it, but they have perfected the subscription profit model, and controlling the spending of their huge users base fiercely! And I bet there's a hidden report out there showing they control the majority of the top dome of socio-economic group. BTW a friend of mine working as senior full stack at MSFT told me they gave him a MacBook when he started working for Microsoft. He's developing MS-Office on a MacBook!!!!!  3. Saudi-Aramco - I know shit about them, but they control oceans of oil and you know.... oil is oil 4. Google - 98% market share for online searches. plus, over 70% global market share of mobile OS and 12% share of  cloud service. All in-house and 100% owned by Google. Oh yeah, and don't forget about Youtube. Oh BTW - do you drive much? did you know that to avoid competition, Google bought Waze too? 5. AMZN - Well to be honest, I don't believe they have a strong valuable market place anymore and I am pessimistic about their retailing now days. In fact I heard somewhere (and I can't find it now) that they lost almost $10B on their forward sellings in 2022, BUT!!!! they earned over $20B off advertising on site which covers the returns and customer's care. we can argue about that, but we can't argue about the crown jewel of AMZN - AWS!!!! 33% of all data on could, is located on an AWS server. You know NFLX, DIS, and WBD streaming services? Along with Amazon prime, they are all located on the same fucking servers!!!! In fact, unless you're watching Youtube or AppleTV, if you're watching streamers, you're watching it off an AWS server!  6. NVDA - let's roll back to it later 7. Meta - I do hate that evil empire, but there's no argue that there's no other company with as much user data as they have. Between Instagram, Facebook, whatsapp - if you want to talk or meet someone, it's probably through one of their platforms, and they monitor it. 8. Tesla - I hate Elon! I think he should be in jail for violating at least 10 SEC regulations. But he's still out there and roaming. I won't argue that TSLA is A-Z solution to car manufacturing. Everything is In-house as well, and the marketing expenses are 0!!! But in a world where everybody are looking for autonomous vehicles, Elon's got the most data collected in the world. When they talked about creating a center control for autonomous driving, they suggested Tesla will be the center since they have the biggest data centers dedicated for it.   &amp;#x200B;  Now lets get back to NVDA - 10 years ago, they were nothing. A great product for a special segment of hardcore computer users willing to spend $200-$500 on hardware no one else even knows needed.   Back then Intel was God and AMD tried biting on them. But got no where close.    Then AI kicked in, and engineers found out GPU are better to teach the modules rather than CPU and guess who's the best GPU manufacturer? wait no!!! It's not NVDA! They have never manufactured a single processor. They don't have a single factory. They do it all with TSMC (number 11 on the list, but around 1/3 the value on NVDA).   Ok so they have the best design. Fuck!!! no they don't!! They use ARM technology to design their processors ($74B market cap). And why ARM are so important? well because couple months ago, NVDA wanted to buy them, so the US regulator looked this deal up, and found out these 2 companies are the only 2 companies to design such technologies and by buying them, NVDA will basically eliminate the competition, and be a full monopoly on ARM architecture processors. so how come one company is worth $74B and the other $1.4T??? because they design the best AI training processors.  WAIT!!!! FUCK they don't!!!!! haven't you heard?? AMD just steamrolled them with Frontier ([     AMD has had the best week in their life!! how good? $250B good. That's still 1/6 of NVDA.   And wait, I mentioned Intel several times before, but what's the deal with them? Well in a nut shell, they have dragged behind. They used to have an enormous market share of processors in the market and they got cocky and neglected R&amp;D while the rest rushed to innovate. But even though you are probably reading this on an Intel based computer, or have one at work/home, and they used to be the sole suppliers for Apple computers, Intel at it's peak was worth $273B (Jan 31st 2020). Still fraction of NVDA's worth. And in opposed to NVDA, ARM and AMD - Intel has always owned their own factories, meaning their worth should combine NVDA and TSMC together!!!!  So the question remains - WTF??????       &amp;#x200B;   2024-01-18 18:27:58]
[China unveils draft for standardizing AI industry,;,; China's industry ministry on Wednesday issued draft guidelines for standardising the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, it said in a statement posted on the ministry's website. The draft proposes to form more than 50 national and industry-wide standards for AI by 2026. It also said China aimed to participate in forming more than 20 international standards for AI by that time.  This comes at a time when China is trying to catch up with the United States in AI development after U.S. company OpenAI shocked the world with its seminal chatbot ChatGPT at the end of 2022.  Last year, Beijing was active in devising regulations for AI including a licensing regime for ChatGPT-like products in the country.  Chinese companies including Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU), Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) (OTCPK:TCTZF) and even startups such as Baichuan and Zhipu are developing their own AI models in an effort to compete with large language models, or LLMs, from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT)-backed OpenAI, and others.  The draft guidelines aim at "seizing the early opportunities from the development of the AI industry", the ministry said.

[Are we in a super bubble? An analysis of the magnificent 7,;,; So first we we recognize that 7 stocks are driving all growth. Nvidia Tesla Meta Microsoft Amazon Apple Google  And we can we can see these companies don't all things in common, but they have a few things.  Platform monopolies: Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon. These companies all have monopolies and no one cares and can continue to die wherever they want to print money  Risks:  Google lost their app store monopoly lawsuit   Amazon loses money to run an unprofitable retail business to get a monopoly. Everyone else has comparable offerings to AWS.  Meta and Google: these are social media plays. The easiest way to destroy America or influence it's politics is via Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube. Foreign governments and local politicians all dump money into these platforms to cause civil unrest and pollute minds.  Risks: Eventually America might actually fall and social media won't be useful anymore. Alternatively, America will topple the governments of the countries doing this, such as Russia and China. Low risk of either outcome.  Nvidia and Tesla. Enron style financial scams. These companies play financial shell games and provide lines of credit to shell companies and broke customers so they can buy their products on paper and manipulate their product prices upwards. Thankfully, Enron ran for almost a decade before it blew up and these companies have only a few years of shady finances, 5 at most for Telsa and less for Nvidia. They may blow up, but not today and not tomorrow.  Risks: the super profitable Enron schemes blow up sooner for Nvidia and Tesla than they did for Enron and we enter the second dotcom burst.  As we can see, all of the magnificent 7 are going to print money for the foreseeable future, at least another 5-10 years until a radical wins office and does major overalls of the systems that allow these companies to be super profitable.,;,; 2023-12-19 02:59:42]
[Pinterest (PINS) Analysis,;,; For the next analysis we will be looking at Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) earnings. Pinterest is an image and aesthetic sharing platform popular among younger users. There are many positives about this stock, but certain events lead me to have skepticism. With that being said, let‚Äôs dive into the analysis and see where the stock could potentially head post earnings and in the future.   Description:   Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) is an image and idea sharing platform founded in 2008. It operates on the idea of being a visual discovery engine allowing users to find new aesthetics, recipes, etc. This allows for ample advertising opportunity, as companies can obtain ad space on the website for products. Recently the company obtained a deal with Amazon where they get a portion of sales revenue generated from users interacting with Amazon ads. This has sparked renewed interest in the company as this deal is expected to generate increasing revenues and give opportunity for expansion with other brands. There have been rumors that Pinterest is in talks with Google to expand the brand partnerships, similar to what they are doing with Amazon which could be a great sign for the stock. But a lackluster performance from Snapchat puts a shadow on the upcoming performance from Pinterest. The largest fear is that ad spend is being sent to larger companies like Meta, which was my fear with SNAP.   Financial Breakdown:  LTM Price Increase: $25.88 ‚Äì $40.63 (+57.00%) Users: Q3 2023 ‚Äì 482MM | Q2 2023 ‚Äì 462MM  Revenue increase: +11.49% YoY Q3 and +7.8% Q2-Q3 Competitors: Facebook (META), Twitter, Tiktok  Earnings:  Q3 Reported EPS: $0.28 (+40.42% delta from expected) | Q3 Reported Revenue: $763.2MM (+2.67% delta)  Stock Move: Stock jumped +26.11% after earnings  Q4 Expected EPS: $0.51 | Q4 Expected Revenue: $990.19B  Verdict:   With Pinterest reporting earnings after market close on February 8th, all eyes will be on the health of advertising within the company‚Äôs revenue. This earnings release will be a big one, but the stock will either booming or completely cratering. The way I see it there are two realities, is Pinterest similar to Meta or Snapchat. In my honest opinion, this stock has a long way to go to be compared to Meta. Although both companies share a portion of their revenues to advertising, Pinterest lacks the products and AI infrastructure needed to provide a stable revenue stream. Although the deal with Amazon is good, Snapchat also shares a very similar deal where customers can purchase directly through their app. Because of the vast similarities in how Pinterest produces revenue, I lack the faith to purchase any long positions in the stock. This all comes in the face of a +30% increase since November. ¬†  Prior to providing my opinion, I must preface with a disclosure that options trading is extremely risky and losing all your money is a very real possibility and that this is not financial advice. Whether you elect to agree with my personal decision is entirely up to you, and this post is simply intended to provide more information into the company. As we head into the report, I expect the management team to try and talk about AI influencing/optimizing the ads and products shown to customers. I believe they will be right around the earnings expectations because of holiday spending, but like Snapchat I think there will be concerns about guidance and ad spend. In my own portfolio, I AM STEERING CLEAR ON THIS STOCK. Historically, the stock has seen a ~13% move in either direction post earnings and I don‚Äôt expect this to be any different. I originally purchased 1 call contract but after looking deeper into the company, and the fact that insiders have sold the stock recently, I can‚Äôt help but think about this logically. The closest competitor, Snapchat vastly underperformed and provided terrible guidance. This, on top of insider selling makes me think the market is anticipating a downward move. A director within the company (Jeffrey Jordan) has been selling 20,000 shares a month this quarter which is very concerning. Even if they beat I think the stock will move downwards because of this reason. But again, anything is possible so a move upward could happen if they announce a partnership with Google and mention efficiency improving levers. If I had to pick a direction, I would anticipate an approximate 10% move downward so $41 puts would look inciting where the break even piece would be at $38.00, prices we haven‚Äôt seen since a whopping 1.5 weeks ago. All in all, I am sitting this one out because I see better opportunities in the market.  We have two more earnings to play this week (AFRM, Cloudfare) so expect to see one more post like this one. I won‚Äôt be doing an in depth play on Cloudfare but purchased calls. Please leave a like and comment if you want to see more. Good luck!,;,; 2024-02-08 19:54:36]
[Why I Believe Nvidia Will Continue To Grow For The Remainder of 2024,;,; The Santa Clara, California-based company controls about 80% of high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock market value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023.  As of February 13, 2024 Nvidia has a P/E ratio of 95.24 which may seem high and it totally is understandable. Company seems overweight, compared to competitors such as Intel who have or P/E ratio of 107.63 or AMD 326.41. Compared to competitors they are not as over valued.   Lets compare Nvidia with other companies around its market cap. Amazon has a P/E ratio of 58.16. The difference between Amazon and Nvidia is Nvidia is bound for more growth in the near future with the boom of AI which they control the AI chip market by a crazy 80%. What about their financials, last quarter Nvidia had 18.12 Total Revenue with a net income of 9.24 billion. Amazon had 143.08 billion with net income of 9.88 billion. Nvidia has a huge profit margin of 51.01% compared to Amazon's measly  6.9%. No doubt Amazon is trying to create a bigger net profit margin but so would Nvidia.   Recently Canada had signed a letter of intent to engage in business with Nvidia. Recent CEO Huang discussed that not only is Canada prioritizing AI infrastructure but also Japan, France, South Korea, Malaysia, Italy and Britain. This tells us that countries want to buy these chips from producers around the world which Nvidia are currently leading. Only problem is supply chain issues.  With this kind of demand meeting supply is dificult. Hopefully Nvidia is able to capitalize this and meet this enormous demand with increased prices to maximize revenue.  Nvidia is setting foot in creating energy efficient computing for AI. They are making custom chips for clients such as Meta, Amazon, etc... To become more efficient in specific needs for each clients. This opens up multiple new paths for increased revenue. Not just that Nvidia is creating Gpu's for the consumers which compute the power for AI, of course enough power to game and design.  \---**Major current buyers:**  * **Cloud giants:**    * **Meta:** A major spender, reportedly purchasing billions of dollars worth of H100 chips for their Metaverse ambitions and AI development.    * **Microsoft:** Another big investor, aiming to power cloud services and its Azure AI platform with Nvidia's tech.    * **Amazon:** Utilizing Nvidia chips for their AWS cloud services and internal AI endeavors.    * **Google:** While Google develops its own AI chips, they also leverage Nvidia's technology for specific applications. * **Tech companies:**    * **Baidu:** China's tech giant is reportedly a significant buyer, using Nvidia chips for AI research and development.    * **Tencent:** Another Chinese tech player heavily invested in AI, likely utilizing Nvidia's chips for various projects.    * **Alibaba:** Their spending details are less transparent, but they're likely in the mix due to their extensive AI efforts.    * **Dell:** As a major PC and server manufacturer, they incorporate Nvidia GPUs in their offerings, contributing to Nvidia's sales.  \---**Potential future buyers:**  * **Other cloud providers:** Companies like IBM Cloud and Oracle Cloud could increasingly turn to Nvidia chips for their AI offerings. * **Startups and smaller companies:** As AI gains traction in various industries, adoption of Nvidia's technology by smaller players is expected to grow. * **Governments:** For projects in areas like national security, healthcare, and research, governments could become significant buyers.  \---**Global reach, with limitations:**  * Nvidia does aim for widespread sales, reaching numerous countries across the globe. They have customers in various regions, including North America, Europe, Asia, and more.  \---**Export controls and restrictions:**  * However, Nvidia needs to adhere to export control regulations set by the US government, where they're headquartered. These regulations might restrict sales to specific countries or for certain uses.  **Examples of restrictions:**  * In October 2023, the US implemented restrictions on selling their most advanced AI chips to China, aiming to prevent their use for military or other sensitive applications. * Similar restrictions might apply to other countries in the future, depending on evolving policies. * Such restrictions can reduce sales but they weren't selling much to China either way. Now they sell chips with slightly less computing power.  **Upcoming potential announcements (based on rumors and speculations):**  * **GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs:** While not officially confirmed, new consumer graphics cards are expected sometime in 2024 or 2025, likely offering further performance boosts for gamers. * **Next-gen DRIVE autonomous vehicle platform:** Nvidia's self-driving technology is constantly evolving, and the next iteration of the DRIVE platform might bring significant advancements. * **New AI chips:** Beyond the recently released H100, Nvidia is likely working on even more powerful and specialized AI chips for various applications.  With the H200 coming second quarter of 2024.  The biggest worries are geopolitical tensions and export restrictions. Do what you will with this info regards.  Edit: my positions 15 shares, picked them up today but on the come up I bought and sold shares. ,;,; 2024-02-13 21:41:30]

[Why hasn't META taken advantage of the AI trend?,;,; I'm curious as to why Meta hasn't taken any steps to ride the hot-wave of AI and the AI war going on between MSFT and GOOG. As far as I'm aware, isn't Meta similarly positioned in terms of R&amp;D and AI technology? Are they purposely keeping it under wraps for whatever reason? If they disclosed they were also going to launch some kind of AI software to the public, I feel like a lot of people would realize how well-positioned they are in the field of AI, rather than being focused only on the metaverse, which has been a contentious topic for most. But I think AI on the other hand would fare quite well considering how people are crazed over it currently.  I sent this post as a prompt into ChatGPT, and this was its answer...  *Meta, formerly Facebook, has been investing heavily in AI research and development for several years. In fact, many of the most innovative and high-profile AI applications have been developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR), which is the company's dedicated AI research division. Some of FAIR's key contributions to the field of AI include advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning, among others.*  *However, Meta's strategy and priorities as a company are not solely focused on AI. While AI is certainly an important part of their technological arsenal, they have also been investing heavily in other areas such as virtual and augmented reality, as well as the Metaverse, which they see as the next major computing platform.*  *In terms of Meta's approach to disclosing their AI capabilities, it is worth noting that many of the most significant advances in AI are often kept under wraps until they are ready for commercial deployment. This is because the field of AI is highly competitive, and companies are often trying to gain a strategic advantage over their competitors. Additionally, there are also concerns around the potential ethical implications of AI, which may lead companies to be cautious about how they disclose their research.*  *Overall, while Meta is certainly a major player in the field of AI, they are also pursuing a wide range of other technological innovations, and it is likely that their AI research will continue to play an important but relatively quiet role in their broader strategy.*  Furthermore, I asked it about specifics of their AI R&amp;D and comparatively to their current competitive counterpart:  *Meta (formerly Facebook) has been investing heavily in AI research and development for several years, and their efforts have resulted in a number of high-profile applications and contributions to the field of AI. Here are a few examples:*  1. *Computer Vision: Meta's computer vision research has led to the development of a number of innovative applications, including automatic image and video captioning, face recognition, and object detection. One particularly noteworthy contribution is the development of the DeepMask and SharpMask algorithms, which are used for high-quality object segmentation in images.* 2. *Natural Language Processing: Meta has made significant progress in natural language processing (NLP) through its work on the Transformers architecture. Transformers is a deep learning model that has achieved state-of-the-art results in a variety of NLP tasks, including machine translation, question answering, and sentiment analysis.* 3. *Reinforcement Learning: Meta has also made important contributions to the field of reinforcement learning (RL), which involves training agents to make decisions based on rewards and punishments. Their RL research has led to the development of advanced algorithms for game playing and other tasks.*  *These are just a few examples of the many areas in which Meta has made important contributions to AI research. In terms of how they compare to other major players in the field, here are a few thoughts:*  * *OpenAI: Like Meta, OpenAI is a major player in the field of AI research, and has made important contributions in a variety of areas. However, OpenAI's focus is somewhat different, as they are specifically dedicated to advancing AI in a way that is safe and beneficial for humanity. This has led them to focus on areas such as reinforcement learning and generative models, as well as research into the potential societal implications of AI.* * *Microsoft: Microsoft is also heavily invested in AI research, and has made significant contributions in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. One notable example is the development of the GPT series of language models, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance in a variety of NLP tasks.* * *Google: Like Meta, Google has made important contributions to AI research in a wide range of areas. Some of their most notable contributions include the development of the TensorFlow machine learning framework, as well as advances in areas such as computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing.*  *Overall, all of these companies are major players in the field of AI research, and each brings unique strengths and perspectives to the table. Meta's research is notable for its focus on computer vision and NLP, as well as their work on the Metaverse and virtual reality.*  It would seem like just a matter of time before they announce something that directly or indirectly competes with Google and Microsoft too, maybe an avatar chatbot AI you can see in VR/AR? That would be pretty cool.  And from there you can quickly see where it would go. Immersive experiences with AI generated content:  I think one path of the AI and metaverse will be influencer and celebrity avatars powered by AI. Have you seen on Twitch, the AI streamers, which are based on the input of all of the footage and recorded videos of the streamer? It's fascinating what the implications are, but imagine you could meet your favorite Twitch streamer, or movie celebrity powered by AI in the metaverse.  In the future, you could let the AI watch a movie, like Star Wars, and it could recreate all the characters in the movie as AI avatars in the movie itself and you could enter into an immersive movie experience as an interactive movie game, all generated by AI.  You could become an avatar, in Avatar, or become Neo in the Matrix, lol.  Powered by Meta, of course.,;,; 2023-02-19 05:43:28]
[Why SNAP is Extremely Undervalued,;,;  SNAP is currently trading roughly 87% off it's ATH and has taken a massive beating after each of its last 6 earnings reports. I believe SNAP is significantly undervalued relative to its peers and well positioned for a turnaround.  Fundamentals:  META, PINS, and SNAP are valued at 817.28B, 19.19B, and 17.26B respectively. META trades at over 47 times the valuation of SNAP despite revenue being 26 times higher. PINS trades at a valuation 11% higher than SNAP despite SNAP's revenue being 58% higher.  A major reason for SNAP's decline is likely the rapid deceleration of it's revenue growth in 2022 and revenue declines in the first half of 2023. The largest impacts to revenue were a downturn in the ad market and the short term damage caused by the overhaul of their ad platform. The ad market has recovered well and the benefits of the ad platform changes are finally starting to show. SNAP's active advertisers had a YOY increase of 20%. Midpoint guidance for Q3 revenue is a 2.5% YOY decrease, which is an improvement from the 7% YOY decrease in Q1 and 4% YOY decrease in Q2. It is likely that guidance is also conservative since this is SNAP's first time issuing formal guidance since the beginning of 2022 and Q3 is generally back-half heavy. SNAP is definitely on track for positive YOY revenue growth by Q4.  A lot of people think SNAP is dead and no one uses it anymore. SNAP has had 18 consecutive quarters of user growth and the most recent quarter shows 397M DAU and 750M MAU. PINS on the other hand only has 463M MAU (38% less than SNAP) and has not reached in a peak in new users since the first quarter of 2021. Twitter, which got taken private at a valuation of 44B (roughly 2.5x SNAP) only had 238M DAU (40% less than SNAP) and 368M MAU (51% less than SNAP).  SNAP has a strong balance sheet, is FCF positive and most of its debt is in low interest convertible notes so there is essentially no bankruptcy risk. The 2025 convertible notes have initial conversion prices of $21.68 and $22.81. It is in the best interest of management to find a way to pump the price above conversion prices so they don't have to repay the loans in cash.  Other Reasons to be Bullish:  Snapchat+ has reached over 4M paid subscribers in one year and will likely continue to grow with the userbase.  My AI has received over 10B messages which will help SNAP better understand their userbase and target ads more effectively. SNAP is also testing sponsored links with My AI (similar to Google's).  Last year SNAP did a massive $1B buyback with an average price of roughly $9.50/share so SNAP's downside seems relatively limited.  Analysts are relatively bearish on SNAP with a low median price target and mostly hold ratings so there is little room for downgrades and lots of potential for upgrades.

[My Match for 2023 (really this pun?),;,; For the sake of boredom right from the start: A bit more than two thousand years ago, the Roman poet Ovid devoted three complete books to the art of love. Quite pragmatically, Ovid begins by explaining where men should go to "hunt" for women: in the circus, at horse races, on triumphal marches, at feasts, or on the beach. Aside from the fact that triumphal marches and gladiatorial fights are rare these days, Ovid's handbook didn't really lose its relevance until a few years ago. But then the digital revolution changed our love lives. In 2012, Tinder launched a platform that reduces the search for a sexual partner to its most basic components: visual attractiveness plus basic information about occupation and status. A boon for some, sometimes cruel, but undeniably efficient. How did potential sexual partners find each other before Tinder? Sometimes through friends, sometimes at work. But the traditional place to meet was out on the town. Let's face it, finding sexual partners is one of the main incentives for going out at night. A plan that in reality only works for a few, and if you soberly calculate the success rate, it is a rather inefficient approach for most. And an expensive one at that. You start the evening with a few drinks, get about 30 minutes of that precious window of time when you are loose but not yet slurred, until some degenerate contemporary orders the first round of shots. Anything after that is almost always a waste of time from a dating perspective. The next morning you wake up alone, ashamed and afraid to look at your bank account.  Shareholders of Match Group, Tinder's parent company, have had a rough time lately. Tinder has, unsurprisingly, failed to maintain revenue compared to the second pandemic year of 2021, and competitors (such as Bumble) have challenged its market position. But is stagnant user growth really such a problem? Tinder has been a household name for years; everyone knows the platform. It should come as no surprise that user numbers can't grow indefinitely. A dating platform like Tinder naturally cannibalizes itself; ideally, two users will find each other and delete the app (at least for some time). But that shouldn't scare investors away. Every year, new cohorts reach Tinder-ready age, and at the same time, the age limit of those who get involved with dating apps like Tinder increases every year. I think Tinder can increase its profitability without increasing its user base. First, it can cut costs and make processes more efficient (as recently as February 2023, Match Group laid off 8% of its employees). In addition, paywalls are becoming more commonplace for any kind of internet service these days, and at the same time, people are becoming less reluctant to pay for such services - Tinder Gold is still cheaper than going out every weekend. It's a bit of a stretch, but the tobacco industry has become increasingly profitable in recent decades, despite declining user numbers, thanks to significant productivity and efficiency gains. Tinder is also attacking its main competitor, Bumble, with its new dating app Hinge, which has seen significant user growth (yes, Hinge also competes with Match Group's own product Tinder).  I realize that I will not get much support for this DD. Especially since I did not find it necessary to summarize and evaluate detailed fundamental data here. But sometimes it is good to just follow the old KISS principle (keep it simple, stupid): Match Group owns Tinder, the iconic dating app - a social network, so to speak - that virtually everyone knows. It also owns Hinge, which could be the next big thing in the dating app market. Match Group is currently valued at $9.7 billion with a PE of 13. Meta, Facebook's parent company, is valued at $547 billion with a PE of 22. That makes Meta about 56 times more valuable than Tinder. I can't help but find that odd.  **This is not financial advice.**  Position:Long: Purchase of 100 shares of Match Group on 04/21/2023 for 31.81‚Ç¨ per share (total: 3181‚Ç¨).,;,; 2023-04-22 16:33:20]
[ZM earnings today, what's in the cards?,;,; Zoom Video Communications (ZM) will be releasing their stuff today, so we get to see how they've fared this recent quarter. Wall Street expect them to report earnings per share of $1.08. Revenue of $1.12 billion, a slight increase of over the prior year quarter when the company reported $1.10 billion.  Zoom‚Äôs forecast for the January 2024 fiscal year calls for revenue of between $4.485 billion and $4.495 billion, up 2%, with adjusted profits of $4.63 to $4.67 a share. Consensus estimates call for revenue of $4.492 billion and earnings of $4.68 a share.  With the coronavirus emergency over, the company's share price has been on a rollercoaster, lads. We're talking cutthroat competition and growth hitting the brakes. But here's the kicker: Zoom's gotta level up in the corporate jungle if it wants to keep its revenue game strong. The company has been seeking to grow by moving beyond its flagship web meeting service. It has added software for contact centers, webinars, chat, and email, plus new artificial intelligence (AI) tools, among other things.  But growth remains slow. The stock has retreated 5% so far this year, with the Nasdaq shooting up 36% amid buzz over generative AI technology. Today, Zoom is likely to post its sixth-straight quarter of single-digit revenue growth.  But, on the plus side: Zoom Video has about $6 billion in cash on its balance sheet, they're sitting on a treasure chest boys, and with this we should expect more acquisitions. In a research note previewing the quarter, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall, dropped some knowledge in a research note: the stock isn‚Äôt likely to move much until investors feel more confident about the company‚Äôs ‚Äúonline‚Äù business, the smaller customers who flocked to the platform during the pandemic. Marshall's playing it chill with an Equal Weight on Zoom.  Another key question, Marshall mentioned, is when some of Zoom‚Äôs fresh toys might spur a reacceleration in the company‚Äôs enterprise business. And she also wonders when Zoom might use its strong balance sheet to make strategic acquisitions. As mentioned earlier, Zoom has $6 billion in cash and short-term investments, equal to about 31% of its market capitalization.  **Important Factors**  Zoom‚Äôs fiscal third-quarter performance is likely to have gained from steady demand for products like Zoom Video Webinars, Zoom Rooms and Zoom Phones. An expanding portfolio of solutions is expected to have aided customer growth in this soon-reported quarter.  The company‚Äôs AI related advancements and partnerships in the fiscal third quarter are noteworthy. Zoom adopts a federated approach to AI, utilizing its own exclusive large-language AI models as well as models from renowned AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic.  In the to-be-reported quarter, ZM threw down its generative AI digital assistant into the mix. Rather than increase revenue, Zoom Video expects AI tools to retain customers. At its annual Zoomtopia user conference in early October, the company said it will not charge customers for use of its AI Companion. That's right. They dished it out FREE for the Zoomers with paid accounts. Talk about a power move! This is totally expected to be a key growth driver. Its capabilities include meeting/chat summaries and smart recordings.  In this conference, the company announced new platform innovations that leverage robust AI capabilities aimed at simplifying the workday by providing efficient communication and collaboration tools.  Zoom Video is racing to build more artificial intelligence tools into its business communications platform. Zoom Video recently backed off from a change in its terms of service for platform users that would have enabled it to gather data to train AI models.  Set for release in 2024, Docs is an AI-powered workspace that can be used for documentation, project tracking and management tasks.  Meanwhile, recently told its employees to report to its offices on a more regular basis. Amid Covid-19 emergency, demand for Zoom videoconferencing software surged as businesses told employees to work from home.  Also, Zoom morphed into a social phenomenon as making video calls became routine for consumers to keep in touch with family and friends. Remote learning and needs in telemedicine also boosted demand for Zoom Video's cloud-based services.  The availability of Zoom Clips, which allows users to easily record, edit and share high-fidelity short-form video messages, both internally and externally, is likely to have aided enterprise customer growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The company also announced the launch of Notes, a fresh workspace designed for creating and collaborating both before, during and after meetings.  Zoom Video aims to integrate AI into more products. At the Enterprise Connect conference in March, Zoom Video announced the expansion of a workplace collaboration platform. Called Zoom IQ, it summarizes chat threads, organizes ideas, drafts content for chats, emails, and whiteboard sessions and creates meeting agendas.  In May, Zoom announced an investment in AI startup Anthropic to support research roadmaps. Anthropic's AI model will be integrated into Zoom's Contact Center platform.  Zoom Video in July rolled out Zoom Workforce Management, which improves agent productivity by automating/optimizing agent work shifts and monitoring agent performance.  The consensus estimate for enterprise customers in the fiscal third quarter is currently pegged at 221,336.  One key to Zoom's success has been a "freemium" business model. Zoom's basic video-calling package is free. They put a limit on the number of participants in a group call and the length of meetings. Zoom software gets high ratings for ease of use and simplicity following earlier video services that provided jerky images and out-of-sync audio. The company‚Äôs freemium business model helps it win customers rapidly, whom it can later convert into paying customers. In the fiscal second quarter, customers contributing more than $100,000 in revenues in the trailing 12 months grew 17.8% to 3,672.    These customers accounted for 29% of revenues, up from 26% in the year-ago quarter. The momentum is expected to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter, the number most likely well above 3,700 now.   A "Zoom Meeting" refers to a videoconferencing session hosted on its cloud infrastructure. Paid Zoom business plans cost $15 or $20 per employee and require minimums of 10 or 50 seats.  Zoom Phone, a cloud-calling product rolled out in 2019, lets customers set up group internet phone calls without video. The Zoom Phone replaces traditional business PBX phone systems.  "Zoom reached 5.5 million paid phone seats at the end of 2023, up over 100% year-over-year," said Baird's Power. "The company expects that to become a 10% revenue segment early this year and perhaps as high as 25% in the future."  However, the company has been facing significant competition from the likes of Cisco, Microsoft and Google Meet. This might have led to a loss in small and medium-sized business customers, which is likely to have hurt top-line growth.  But let's talk competition, specifically with Microsoft. Sales growth slowed for the ninth-straight quarter as the company adjusts to slower product demand in the post-coronavirus emergency era. See, I'm left wondering when decelerating sales will hit a bottom.  Zoom's cloud-based software sets up video calls, with chat tools available. Also, customers can easily share content. Microsoft and its Teams communications tools are pretty much offering the same and are Zoom's major rival in the business market. Microsoft is upgrading its products with technology from startup OpenAI.  The company in early March said company President Greg Tomb, a former cloud computing executive at Alphabet's Google, will leave. They also mentioned in Feb. 7 that they will cut 1,300 jobs, or about 15% of its workforce.  As the coronavirus crisis eases, retaining small businesses as well as corporate accounts will be one key to Zoom's success. For customers with one to 10 employees, renewals are expected to slow as the economy reopens and shelter-in-place orders lift. There's expected to be less turnover of larger customers.  In the business market, Zoom rivals include RingCentral (RNG), Cisco Systems, Google and others. Growth in annual recurring revenue for business customers with contracts topping $100,000 is one metric to monitor.  In July 2021, Zoom Video and Five9 (FIVN), which automates call center services, announced a deal to merge. The all-stock deal was originally valued at $14.7 billion. But the companies terminated the agreement on Sept. 30.  Zoom Video aims to be a player in the contact center market with its own products and services.  **What to do for earnings?**  Over the last 2 years, the shares averaged a move of 7.4% with earnings, regardless of direction. Options currently are pricing in a bigger-than-usual move tho. I'm going to consider this a lotto play, and grab calls: 11/24 70c @ 1.42. Why? Because I believe it's really time that they turn things around with their AI usage and increasing customer base. If earnings are bad, it's simply not going to crash low enough for puts to be profitable. However, with expecations pegged at where they are, calls might be the move here. Keep in mind, like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. Later this week, we have NVDA.,;,; 2023-11-20 20:49:42]
[Preliminary DD: ROKU,;,; So this is far from complete but I'm a regard and playing Roku earnings. I am bullish and believe Roku will beat their previous guidance, however - judging how the market will react is a different story.  If you have comments or want to add links/info please let me know. I'm also active in the Discord server if you want to discuss there.  **Breaking News:**  * [  **Key Documents / Info:**  * [ * Restructuring costs could impact Q3:    * The information contained in Item 2.05 above is incorporated herein by reference. In connection with the above-described measures, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 the Company expects to record an impairment charge in a preliminary estimated range of $160 million to $200 million related to ceasing to use certain office facilities and an impairment charge in a preliminary estimated range of $55 million to $65 million related to removing select existing licensed and produced content from Company-operated services on its TV streaming platform. The Company does not expect any material cash expenditures in connection with the impairment charge related to content.    * The Company expects to record a restructuring charge related to the  workforce reduction, primarily consisting of severance and benefits  costs, in a preliminary estimated range of $45¬†million to $65¬†million    * [ * Platform revenue was $744 million in Q2, up 11% YoY. We generate Platform revenue primarily from the sale of digital advertising (including media and entertainment promotional spending, the demand-side Platform , and related services), as well as content distribution services (such as subscription and transaction revenue shares, and the sale of Premium Subscriptions). ARPU was $40.67 (on a trailing 12-month basis), down 7% YoY. This decline was due to strong global Active Account growth outpacing Platform revenue growth.While Q2 Platform revenue exceeded our expectations, the macro environment continued to create uncertainty with the total U.S. advertising market remaining flat YoY in Q2. Ad spend on traditional TV declined 9.4% YoY, and traditional TV ad scatter was down 17.2% YoY (according to SMI). Consistent with Q2 industry trends, brand advertising on the Roku platform remained pressured YoY in verticals like technology and M&amp;E (media and entertainment) which was offset by increasing spend from important categories like CPG (consumer packaged goods) and health and wellness. Also, the macro uncertainty has impacted the timing of Upfront negotiations, with commitments proceeding at a slower pace across the industry. * [ * [ * [ * [ * [ * [    * "Madison Avenue pulled hundreds of millions of dollars out of primetime TV and sent them to streaming venues in the industry‚Äôs recently completed ‚Äúupfront‚Äù market, the latest sign that one of the media sector‚Äôs most stable mediums is in an era of severe flux."  **Warning:**  * Roku previously raised guidance for Q3:  Excluding charges related to items such as severance and the removal of select content from its streaming platform, Roku now expects third-quarter net revenue in the range of $835 million to $875 million, with adjusted EBITDA in the range of negative $40 million to negative $20 million. This is ahead of its previous Q3 forecast for revenue of roughly $815 million and adjusted EBITDA of negative $50 million. * Large insider transactions but many of them appear to be related to repositioning from personal ownership to trust ownership and vis versa.  **Customers and Revenue Streams:**  * Consumers purchase Roku branded/distributed TV and home entertainment devices. Roku sells most of their hardware at cost. Roku provides consumers the ability to watch: ad-supported video on demand, live TV, and subscription based content. * TV Manufacturers pay a licensing fee for every TV that uses Roku OS (fee is incurred when TV is sold and activated via internet connection). * Content Providers pay Roku in multiple ways:    * Commissions for each subscription purchased on a Roku TV       * Apple TV raising prices, starting October 25 2023       * Discovery Plus raising prices, starting November 3 2023       * AMC Plus launching discounted ad supported service starting in Q3/Q4 2023       * Disney+ raising prices, starting October 12 2023       * Hulu raising prices, starting October 12 2023.       * Paramount+ raised prices on July 27 2023       * Peacock raised prices on July 18 2023       * Starz raised prices starting July 2023       * Average price increase is about 15%. However, this is not very helpful because Roku does not break down the proportion of Platform Revenue that is related to advertising and subscription commissions. My best guess is that 97.5 million of Roku's revenue comes from subscriptions. This is based off the language in the last quarterly filing that said stronger subscription revenue offset a loss in advertising revenue for certain segments. We can gut check this by comparing this number to the number of users/TV sold, a reasonable conversion rate, and an average streaming cost of $8 per month or $24 per quarter with 20% commission given to Roku. Given the roughly 100,000,000 Roku platform TVs currently active this would mean Roku would need a 2% conversion rate. Meaning 2% of customers who bought a TV with the Roku platform used the Roku TV to subscribe to a service. (I have no idea how this industry works, I'm on WSB, but that conversion rate seems reasonable). So the price hikes would likely only add \~14.625 million to Roku's revenue in Q4 2023 with a small amount captured in Q3 2023. If you want to "massage" the numbers, if you assume a 2% conversion rate you could see an additional $29.25 million in revenue every quarter for Roku due to price hikes. That would nearly put adjusted EBITDA guidance (not including restructuring) for 2023 in positive territory which investors will certainty like.    * Content branded buttons on each Roku remote    * Disney+ with ads joined the Roku platform in April    * The Roku Channel is also finally available on Google TV and Android devices. * Commercial advertisers pay Roku based on hours of ads watched and other metrics * Walmart and Shopify pay Roku when a purchase is conducted through a Roku TV. * Notably, Roku has a partnership with Youtube but does not receive any revenue from this agreement.  **Material News:**  * [ * [ * [  **Historical Financials and Estimates:**  * You can use Google for the details, regard. Search "Roku revenue breakdown" or use Google Finance.    **Related Companies:**  * Vizio, Fubo, Amazon (Streaming), Disney (Streaming), Comcast (Streaming), Other Streaming Companies. I know I am missing a few here.  **Some Revenue Calculations:**  Roku gets a 20% commission on the majority of subscriptions made through the Roku platform. Amazon Prime and Netflix do not pay this commission. If we can determine the number of subscribers the streaming companies added in Q3 and then assume 5% of those subscribers did so via a Roku TV then we can combine that with pricing information to estimate a portion of Roku's revenue. 5% is on the low end, some outdated sources said as many as 27% of sign ups happen through the Roku platform - but I doubt it is that high. I also use 1.5 months assuming a constant rate of sign up throughout the quarter for each service.  * Peacock was a bright spot for Comcast in Q3, adding 4 million subscribers in the quarter and taking the total to 28 million paid customers, roughly 80% higher than a year ago. Higher pricing for the streaming service also boosted revenue to $830 million, a 64% increase from the prior-year quarter.    * 5% of subscribers through Roku    * $5.99 per month low tier    * 1.5 months    * 4,000,000 x 0.05 x 5.99 x 1.5 = 1,797,000 in growth revenue * Hulu added 100,000 subscribers in Q3:    * 5% of subscribers through Roku    * $8 per month low tier    * 1.5 months    * 100,000 x 0.05 x 8 x 1.5 = 60,000 * Paramount+ added 700,000 subscribers in Q3:    * 5% of subscribers through Roku    * $6 per month low tier    * 1.5 months    * 700,000 x 0.05 x 6 x 1.5 = 315,000 * Apple TV added \~400,000 subscribers in Q3    * 5% of subscribers through Roku    * $7 per month low tier    * 1.5 months    * 400,000 x 0.05 x 7 x 1.5 = 210,000 * **This only gets us about 2.4 million in new revenue from Q2. But notably this is only a portion of the subscription commission revenue and does not include any increase or decrease in advertising revenue. Need to do more calculations. I would welcome any help.**  **Thesis / Conclusion:**  Roku will:  * Beat on active users and hours watched through Roku because:    * Netflix crackdown    * International expansion    * Low cost products, a purchase of a cheap TV is an investment into cheaper entertainment * Beat on device sales because:    * International expansion    * Consumers worldwide are moving towards cheaper products       * [ * Report revenue of $865 million because:    * General strength in advertising industry: AMZN reported massive ad revenue/growth after GOOG, META, SPOT, NFLX, etc.    * Some price increases will be captured in Q3    * The Amazon password sharing crackdown may have caused people to sign up to commission paying services through a Roku TV. * Revenue guidance may be increased higher and a wider range because:    * Uncertainty on how price hikes will impact subscriptions    * Uncertainty on whether the resilience and change to stream based advertising spending will continue to beat out linear advertising (traditional TV). * EPS is tricky but I believe it will beat on an adjusted EBITDA basis if certain severance payments from layoffs are not included. How they exclude or include restructuring costs in EDBITDA will be key. This goes for any future EPS forecasts as well.,;,; 2023-10-27 01:31:18]
[Why I'm getting MSFT calls for earnings.,;,; Microsoft (MSFT) will report its third fiscal quarter (Q3) 2023 results today after the market closes. The report will cover the quarter from January 2023 to March 2023.  **Microsoft Earnings Expectation**  Revenues: $51.05 billion. 4% year-over-year growth but 4% lower than the previous quarter.  EPS: $2.23, no change from a year ago and 3.8% lower than Q2.  **What to watch for**  Out of the three business divisions, the Intelligent Cloud department has become Microsoft‚Äôs gold mine nowadays, contributing 40% of the group‚Äôs total revenue with sound and solid growth momentum. In the previous quarter, the cloud services‚Äô revenue increased 18% while whole group‚Äôs revenue only added 2%.  For the to-be-reported quarterly earnings, Microsoft anticipated revenues from the Intelligent Cloud will keep increasing at the pace between 17% and 19% to a range of $21.7-$22 billion. However, Microsoft also flagged that Azure, the cloud computing platform that which is one of the main engines of the cloud business, would slow down its growing speed by 4 or 5 percentage points to near 30% in the fiscal third quarter, down from 46% in the same period last year.  Q2 FY23 Financial Summary:   **The laggard**  The downtrend in the global personal computing industry has accelerated in the past year. So did Microsoft‚Äôs PC business. In the six months ended December 31th, the revenue from the PC related business was down 11% YOY, while in the last three month, the yearly downfall rate was speed up to 19%.  The first quarter of this year has marked the fifth consecutive quarter of global PC sales decline. As such, it's not difficult to see that this hard-to-stop slide will further falter the demand for all the product line under the umbrella of Personal Computing. The used-to-be-proud King of the PC projected this sector's revenue for Q3 will be between $11.9 billion and $12.3 billion, indicating a 14%-17% decline from the same quarter last year.    **The AI Race**  The battlefield for the AI race has been set up and the smoke is getting intense.  Microsoft seemly led the way for now thanks to its shared commitment with OpenAI to build generative AI systems--ChatGPT has convinced the world in 2023 that, AI will become a topping layer of technology and prompt a new generation of ‚Äúplatform shift‚Äù.  Clearly, all the tech giants are not hesitated to go all-in in the AI race and are ready to thrive in this new age. Microsoft, despite racing inches ahead now, is facing the fiercest competition in decades. Alphabet, Google‚Äôs parent company, unveiled a similar AI function in March for Gmail, which is now used by 1.8 billion people around the world. Apple disclosed that 45% of its M&amp;A targets are AI-related compared to Microsoft‚Äôs 23% now. In terms of the bright minds, Meta has employed 23.5% of staff with AI skills while Microsoft‚Äôs ratio is 21.8%  Additionally, the ticket to the AI race is very costly. Microsoft has boosted its R&amp;D investment in the previous quarter by 18% to 6.8 billion, which, saw its net margin fell from 36% to 30% in the September quarter.  As Chairman and CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella said in January: ‚ÄúThe next major wave of computing is being born.‚Äù Microsoft is not shy with its ambition to be the king of the new wave, the challenge being, all its old foes are thinking the same.  **Microsoft Share Price**  Despite the bright limelight this year thanks to ChatGPT, Microsoft‚Äôs stock price didn‚Äôt enjoy extra shine compared to other tech titans. But the good news is the price has clearly bottomed out from the Nov-Jan low when the two-year-low was made.  Based on the weekly chat, the stock is currently attempting to challenge the August peak at around 291-296, a hurdle that could open the door to $300 psychological level if successfully conquered.  Conversely, if the break fails, any pullback should be supported by the 100-MA to preserve the bull-biased momentum. However, a fall below this level will risk further breaching the current ascending trajectory and increase the chance of a bear-reversal.  But the recent price movements are not going to play a role in whether it goes up or down tonight. I believe it would be smart to get calls for earnings. I think a MSFT call spread would be good. Buy the 4/28 280c and sell the 290c, which would cost about $277. You could be leaving with 3.6x gains if this goes well!,;,; 2023-04-25 19:46:47]

[Washington prepares for war with Amazon on mergers, antitrust, privacy and more,;,; The Biden administration is planning to take action soon on at least three of its half-dozen investigations of Amazon ‚Äî moves that could lead to a blitz of litigation to rein in the iconic tech-industry giant.  The FTC has been investigating the internet titan on multiple fronts dating at least back to 2019, looking into its abuse of power within its online marketplace, as well as potential consumer-privacy violations connected to its Ring cameras and Alexa digital assistant.  The agency is also reviewing Amazon‚Äôs purchase of robot vacuum maker iRobot. Any suit against Amazon would be a high-profile move by the agency under chair Lina Khan, a Big Tech skeptic who rose to prominence with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in.  Although Amazon has already been hit by local antitrust suits in Washington, D.C. and California, the coming federal cases would be the most significant challenges to the global company yet. The exact timing of any cases or settlements is unknown.  POLITICO spoke to more than 10 people with direct knowledge of the investigations by the FTC‚Äôs competition and consumer protection teams to put together a comprehensive picture of how the agency is now pursuing Amazon, why it didn‚Äôt take action on the company‚Äôs most recent major acquisition of One Medical and what is likely to happen in the coming months. According to those people, who were granted anonymity to discuss confidential investigations:  The FTC is currently weighing whether to challenge Amazon‚Äôs $1.7 billion acquisition of robot vacuum maker iRobot, with the agency‚Äôs staff attorneys leaning toward suing to stop the deal according to three people with knowledge of that investigation. That case could come in the next few months. It has at least two open privacy investigations, one into Amazon‚Äôs Ring camera and security system business, and the other into its Alexa voice assistant over potential violations of the Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act, according to four people with knowledge of those cases. The result of at least one of the FTC‚Äôs privacy investigations could come in the next couple of months, one of the people said. FTC staff previously recommended filing a lawsuit over alleged privacy and data security violations at Ring before Khan started. Also potentially coming in the next few months is a wide-ranging antitrust case targeting Amazon‚Äôs retail operations, multiple people with knowledge of the probe said. Though the details of a complaint are not known, it could include the bundling of services through its Prime subscription business and its use of competitor data to out-muscle rival retailers on its platform, according to some of those people. The FTC has been investigating nearly every aspect of the company‚Äôs business since 2019, and a lawsuit has long been expected. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that an antitrust case could be filed against Amazon in the coming months. The FTC is pursuing a so-called ‚Äúdark pattern‚Äù probe into the difficulty customers have unsubscribing from Prime and other services. Dark patterns are deceptive tactics used by websites to trick users into doing things like subscribing to a more expensive service than they intended. It is also conducting a deceptive advertising probe into the ‚ÄúAmazon Choice‚Äù label the company gives certain products on its marketplace. The FTC is investigating how that label is used to promote products that appear in search results, including whether it is pay-to-play. Amazon maintains it is not. Nicholas Thompson interviews David Limp onstage. Hold the satellite subsidies. A top Amazon exec is more worried about space junk. BY JOHN HENDEL Representatives for the FTC and Amazon both declined to comment on the investigations.  The lack of action so far shows the difficulties facing the agency in taking on a company as multifaceted as Amazon ‚Äî and suggests the FTC is picking its cases with caution, according to some of the people, who are familiar with the agency‚Äôs strategy.  The FTC has sued Amazon before, accusing it of illegally withholding tips from some delivery drivers. The company settled the case and paid almost $60 million to reimburse drivers.  Top enforcement officials in the Biden administration have aggressively gone after corporate mergers and tech firms in the past year. The FTC last year sued to block Microsoft‚Äôs $69 billion purchase of Activision, and the Justice Department has two separate lawsuits against Google over its search and advertising businesses in addition to preparing an antitrust case against Apple.  The FTC is also coming off a loss in its case to block Meta‚Äôs acquisition of a popular virtual reality app. While the judge in the case validated the FTC‚Äôs novel theory that it could be illegal for companies to acquire, rather than build, a product, he also said the agency did not have the facts to support its claims.  In that environment, the FTC is under immense pressure to bring a successful antitrust case against Amazon ‚Äî particularly after letting two of the company‚Äôs largest deals through without opposition in the past year, according to agency insiders and observers.  Amazon closed its $8.5 billion purchase of MGM Studios in March 2022, with the agency‚Äôs hands tied as its four commissioners at the time deadlocked along partisan lines on whether to intervene. Then last month, the agency elected to pass on challenging the company‚Äôs $3.9 billion purchase of the primary care provider One Medical despite agency officials‚Äô belief that the deal was anticompetitive, according to three people with knowledge of the agency‚Äôs decision.  The rumble over Roombas  Most of the FTC‚Äôs Amazon investigations were launched during the Trump administration, when Republican chair Joe Simons began a broad oversight push on tech giants.  One exception is the $1.7 billion iRobot deal ‚Äî along with One Medical ‚Äî which was announced in August 2022.  The agency has not yet concluded its investigation of the deal, and is continuing to collect documents and testimony from third parties, five of the people with knowledge of the review said.  FTC staff do not believe that Amazon, the leading online retailer in the U.S., should be allowed to buy the largest maker of a popular product sold on its platform, the people said.  Among its issues, those people said, the agency is concerned that Amazon will favor iRobot‚Äôs Roombas over competing brands of automated vacuums such as Samsung. The FTC is also concerned about how the addition of iRobot will add to the control Amazon has in the broader market for connected home devices. Amazon also owns the home security company Ring, and makes the popular voice assistant Alexa and Echo smart speaker. And the FTC is asking whether Amazon would withhold Roombas from competing retailers altogether.  The FTC has also asked how the deal would increase Amazon‚Äôs control over consumer data, as well as potential privacy harms, but that is not the main focus, according to some of the people.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working cooperatively with the relevant regulators in their review of the merger. We have no plans to operate iRobot differently than how they operate today in regards to its availability through other retailers,‚Äù said Amazon spokesperson Curtis Eichelberger. ‚ÄúWe will continue to supply other retailers and vendors with iRobot products, and continue to sell other products on Amazon.com.‚Äù Amazon also plans to maintain iRobot‚Äôs interoperability with other voice assistants, Eichelberger said.  Amazon has been largely unresponsive to the FTC‚Äôs investigation so far, refusing to turn over information requested by the FTC, some of the people said.  For a targeted company, this can be a strategy to run out the clock: Merger reviews are governed by strict statutory time restrictions. In an in-depth review of a merger, the government has 30 days to decide whether to sue once a company meets all the investigative demands. Companies often agree to give the FTC or Justice Department more time, but Amazon has made no such concession, sources said.  In this case though, the FTC likely has time, given the companies also need approval in the EU and UK before they can close their deal. Those reviews are still in the early stages.  An iRobot spokesperson did not respond for comment.  Roomba robot vacuums made by iRobot are displayed on a shelf. The FTC is currently weighing whether to challenge Amazon‚Äôs $1.7 billion acquisition of robot vacuum maker iRobot, with the agency‚Äôs staff attorneys leaning toward suing to stop the deal according to three people with knowledge of that investigation. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Why the FTC didn‚Äôt try to block the One Medical deal  One reason for FTC‚Äôs lack of action on Amazon so far, say experts, is that it‚Äôs technically very hard to bring cases against tech giants, either for enforcers or private plaintiffs ‚Äî in part because they control all the data that enforcers need to build a case.  ‚ÄúThe platforms have an enormous information advantage and unique access to the evidence that the government or plaintiffs need to meet their burden of proof,‚Äù said Amanda Lewis, in Senate testimony this month. Lewis is a partner with Cuneo, Gilbert and Laduca, and previously worked at the FTC and as a Hill staffer on tech and antitrust issues.  Another illustration of the difficulty is the most recent antitrust case the agency didn‚Äôt pursue against Amazon: Its $3.9 billion purchase of One Medical, a primary care company providing access to doctors through individual and corporate subscriptions.  The FTC extensively investigated the One Medical deal and found evidence of anticompetitive behavior that many at the agency considered damning, but ultimately cleared the deal because they saw it as too hard of a case to win, according to multiple people with knowledge of the agency‚Äôs thinking.  That evidence includes Amazon‚Äôs decision to abruptly end lengthy negotiations to poach some of One Medical‚Äôs corporate customers with cheaper pricing in favor of killing off its competing Amazon Care service and acquiring the company, those people said.  In one instance, Amazon was trying to lure the ride-hailing company Lyft to sign a deal for its own health care service, according to three people with knowledge of Lyft‚Äôs testimony during the merger review. Amazon offered to substantially undercut One Medical on price and offered a national network of doctors ‚Äî but when Lyft was ready to sign with Amazon, the retail giant announced its takeover of One Medical, pulled out of negotiations with Lyft, and then said it was shutting down Amazon Care, the three people said.  A spokesperson for Lyft declined to comment.  Other companies had similar testimony, two of the people said. Though many FTC staffers saw that behavior as anti-competitive and illegal ‚Äî acquiring a competitor rather than competing on the merits ‚Äî the agency ultimately decided it would be too challenging to define exactly what market Amazon was monopolizing, some of the people said.  ‚ÄúWe decided independent of, and prior to, the One Medical acquisition, that the Amazon Care offering and business model wasn‚Äôt going to work long-term,‚Äù Eichelberger said.  For the FTC, time is not on their side. With just 19 months until the election and a potential change in administration, it‚Äôs in the agency‚Äôs interest to move on these cases as quickly as possible, lest priorities change in a new regime.,;,; 2023-03-21 23:12:55]

[Mark Zuckerberg Says Meta Will Own Billions Worth of Nvidia H100 GPUs by Year End,;,; From Barrons:  &gt; Instagram Thursday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will have 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units and overall almost 600,000 H100 compute equivalent GPUs by the end of this year.  &gt; T he H100 is Nvidia‚Äôs current top-of-line data center GPU and costs roughly $25,000 per GPU, according to a slide in an earlier company presentation that showed a 16 H100 GPU system costs $400,000.  &gt; Though, it is unknown at what price Meta can purchase the H100, a quantity of 350,000 at $25,000 per GPU comes to nearly $9 billion.,;,; 2024-01-22 03:29:38]
[Meta shares pop 12% after company reports first sales increase in four quarters, issues optimistic guidance,;,; Article:   Meta's first-quarter sales rose 3% from $27.91 billion a year earlier, after three straight periods in which revenue declined.  For the second quarter, Facebook parent Meta expects revenue of between $29.5 billion and $32 billion, while analysts were expecting sales of $29.5 billion, according to Refinitiv.  "We had a good quarter and our community continues to grow," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. The company is "becoming more efficient so we can build better products faster and put ourselves in a stronger position to deliver our long term vision," he said.  Meta's Reality Labs unit, which is developing the virtual reality and augmented reality technologies for the metaverse, brought in $339 million in sales but logged an operating loss of $3.99 billion. The company added that operating losses in Reality Labs will increase this year.    Net income companywide fell 24% to $5.71 billion, or $2.20 per share, from $7.47 billion, or $2.72 per share, in the same quarter last year.  Restructuring charges reduced Meta's earnings per share by 44 cents.  Meta said that total expenses for 2023 will be in the range of $86 billion to $90 billion. That figure includes restructuring costs that range between $3 billion to $5 billion.  Capital expenditures will remain in the range of $30 billion to 33 billion. That figure accounts for its increased artificial intelligence investments and its ad-supported products like the newsfeed and Reels, the company said.  The after-market rally further boosted a stock that's been on an upward trend since Zuckerberg announced in February that 2023 would be the company's "year of efficiency."  The shares lost two-thirds of their value in 2022, but were up 74% this year, prior to the earnings report. Including the post-report surge on Wednesday to over $234, the shares are up about 164% from their November 2022 low of around $89.  Investors have rallied around Zuckerberg's plans to slim down his company through a series of layoffs, resulting in some 21,000 expected job cuts. The revenue base had been shrinking from a battered online advertising market and the lingering effects of Apple's 2021 iOS privacy update that dramatically limited ad-targeting capabilities.,;,; 2023-04-27 01:15:42]

[Which AR company is the ideal investment?,;,; I'll just say first off, I don't think AR is the big investment right now. AI is clearly here now, and AR is maybe 5 years out before some VERY heavy investment. Right now the leaders are Meta and Apple.   Opinions:   Meta Case: Meta's headset makes you look like a cyborg, its very goofy looking compared to the Apple Vision Pro. It's also angled at gaming, which is problematic because none of the major gaming companies have committed to it, meaning until that occurs there is no guarantee that the gaming angle plays out. I imagine programming a VR game is SIGNIFICANTLY more intensive of an investment than required for an xbox game. That said META is not cannibalizing its own sales nearly as much as Apple...  &amp;#x200B;  Apple Case: The vision pro looks much cleaner, as do almost all Apple products. Apple has the wearable tech that will help them make the headset much smaller over time. They are also angled towards business. I just watched the Vision Pro video and frankly it looks like a great product for three reasons: The clean look, the dimming of a room when watching TV/movies which enhances the experience and makes it more convenient. Finally, I think the environment one is very good. I can be doing my work on the vision pro "literally" surrounded by Mount Doom's lava and Frodo bringing the ring up to the mountain. The massive con is that the vision pro cannibalizes the iphone and the mac book. As the vision pro gains traction there is immediately less of an incentive for using the iphone and the mac book which make up a big piece of apple's sales.  &amp;#x200B;  What are your thoughts? Right now, my money is in Meta, but after seeing Apple's product I think apple has gone the right direction. Meta is too reliant on the gaming industry and they haven't made it nearly as suitable for wearing it in social situations. No way you're wearing that headset around other people at a party.,;,; 2024-01-20 14:36:41]

Or around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs.‚Äù*](   , which means they might order another 200k from Nvidia, or he may *"find 2\*x H100 equivalent to compute"* to avoid paying a premium over generally specialized Nvidia GPUs and buy more specialized and power-to-output optimized ASICs chips like Google's TPUs.       I don't think other big tech (Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS) giants will order more GPUs because running a general-purpose GPU is very expensive: [Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company. Each query costs roughly 4 cents, according to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.](   Google already has its own ASICs chips called TPU.    Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family.      Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.  And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers.     Small businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud capacities (mostly Google because of their TPU's low power-to-cost ratio).      The rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent.      **\[Conclusions\]:** Their a moderate-low probability Q4 revenues will reach a plateau of around 15-20 billion.

And not ChatGPT clones. The market has not figured yet the TAM (total addressable market) of services like ChatGPT.       However, I try to speculate on [open numbers]( which have stagnated for the last 6 months.      100 million monthly active users \* 10$ per subscription produces 1 billion in revenue.

The query is a single text message you send to the chatbot.      2000 \* 0.04 = 80 $ to service 1 user per month.    Until the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month.    No wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription.  It doesn't seem sustainable.     Last note,  the majority of data centers upgrade their equipment every 4-5 years. So, if AI expectations won't burst, and chip efficiency improves 10-fold, and other chip makers won't catch up, don't expect big tech to re-stock their chips earlier than the end of 2027.      &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2024-01-21 22:17:52]
[Did the era of cheap money create new monopoly?,;,; It may not seem relevant to investing but here we go.   Back in the days, Rocketfeller was broken into smaller companies due to its monopoly on oil.   Nowadays I‚Äôve heard that there are only three companies that control meat processing.

[1 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,;,; Last year there was a post asking what folks were doing to profit from the current/upcoming recession on Hacker News: [  I replied ([ that I purchased some pandemic stocks, which I started doing in April 2022. Most of my purchasing was through summer 2022, but I've bought others more recently, like Carvana on the dip in December (which luckily popped since it became a meme stock), as well as Meta, Amazon and Google on the dips in October. The most recent was Allbirds on the dip in March since I had just purchased the shoes and they quickly became my favorite.  Overall, I'm up 36%, but as you can imagine a few winners (which I luckily have larger stakes in) make up for the losers. My target timeline is \~3 years, and we could still see a deeper recession from a hard landing, so I plan to post more annual updates.  There were multiple lots of some stocks, so I've summarized each with the overall unrealized gain/loss so far as of this morning:  * Affirm: -11.33% * Amazon: +25.25% * Allbirds: +9.43% * Coinbase: -34.32% * Carvana: +306.5% * Google: +29.35% * Meta: +170.89% * Cloudflare: +14.35% * Netflix: +97.08% * Peloton: -54.61% * Roblox: +25.14% * Shopify: +39.26% * Snapchat: +3.21% * Snowflake: +11.14% * Unity: +8.91%  **Some commentary**  It's hard to convey how much of a roller coaster the the last 12 months have been, with some pretty large negative swings that I just had to watch and not react to. There are likely more to come, especially since it seems a lot of the potential good news is already priced in.  Interestingly, in that post I mentioned Peloton was one I regretted almost instantly, and is now my worst performer by far. Unfortunately, greed got the best of me and I caught that falling knife buying a few times as the stock dropped further. I was hoping they would get rid of the excess inventory, improve distribution and double down on subscriptions to turn things around, but that hasn't materialized. Maybe it still will, or they get acquired.  Despite the strong gains, I still feel Shopify (improved focus, strong brand), Netflix (new ad tier, other new streaming services struggling and likely to go back to content), and Meta (improved targeting post privacy changes + AI opportunities) still have good upside potential.  I also really like Microsoft due to their enterprise moat and opportunities with AI, but their stock never had the correction the other stocks did and that was the scent I was chasing at the time (right or wrong). But long-term, I also wonder if AI will negate the need for human productivity software since the AI can just do it and review/edit mode requires less bloat (e.g. video with Final Cut Pro vs. TikTok, or images with Photoshop vs. Instagram). I wouldn't doubt if we see an AI-native productivity suite that doesn't just integrate AI, but predicated on simplfy reviewing AI generated content.  I'm disappointed to have missed Nvidia (up 3X since October) since I used to own it and have been watching it since the crypto bust created excess inventory and a predictable dip, then the AI trend led to the recovery. The valuation feels rich, but could easily grow into it given the trajectory of AI, unless the hyperscalers make their own chips.  Perhaps counterintuitively, it seems it's more useful to read/listen to tech/business analysts than financial analysts/stock pickers since, at the end of the day, you need to make your own decisions about the fundamentals and prospects of the business. Financials are a good indicator of fundamentals, but by definition backward looking while valuation is forward looking.  I'm curious to see how these perform if the US enters a broader recession in the next 18 months. I don't plan to sell unless something catastrophic happens and I see a better opportunity to shift to.  **Update \~6mo later here:**  2023-06-12 19:18:14]

[One common mistake of a novice trader,;,; Let's imagine the mindset of beginners. Beginners want to earn quickly, a lot and with minimal effort. And most likely, we know from our experience, they will be quite fearful. So they will choose those instruments that are well-known and have a good reputation. These will probably be stocks of companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple.  **How will beginners add companies to their portfolio?**   Let's specify that the stocks of these companies are not cheap and cost 100-300 dollars. Of course beginners want to fill their portfolio on enthusiasm right now. This means our trader will go to the stock exchange and simply buy them.   **What is wrong with that?**   The point is that you should buy shares of even the seemingly coolest and most famous companies not at any moment of time when you want to, but look at whether it is a good time to enter a position.   **What does good or bad timing mean?**   In investing for 10-15 years the concepts of good and bad time lose their relevance. Because for such a long period of time stocks can fall and rise 100 times.  But if we speak about from 1 to 6 months trading, it is very important to choose the right moment. Because you need to earn money rather quickly and you want to earn more, of course.   For the sake of simplicity let's consider 2 companies: META and AAPL.    Both of them have a beautiful growing chart for the last year of trading, but you should not buy both companies now, if you take them for a short term.   The fact is that META and AAPL stocks are at their all-time highs right now. They have rallied strongly over the past couple months and there will soon be a period when the price will be corrected. Since there is no one chart in the market that is a forever rising straight line. There will always come moments of correction. And if you buy their stocks now, you are very likely to buy at the most expensive price in recent times.   That's why it's important to learn how to analyze charts and choose the moments to buy or sell smartly.,;,; 2024-01-25 18:36:53]

[If your starting out its actually the time you can beat the market? Is it really that hard to find 2x opportunities,;,; I know this will go against all advice but surely you only need to make a couple of moderate risk bets to beat your 5 year outlook in the snp500?   So if you make a $10,000 upfront investment at 12% a year which overall 81.67% in the s&amp;p500.  Why not instead hold an even lower risk investment, at the moment say cash at 5% and wait for a META like crash or something simular that is very very likely to result in 2x returns, you then have beat the market over the 5 year period with literally one bet? You could split this up between say 3 simular opportunities over a 5 year period, we are talking 40%+ downswings in companies that are near the top of the snp500 and otherwise have a strong outlook. You could split this investments up over a 6 month period to try to catch the bottom investing more depending on the percentage reduction.  This will surely beat the market? ,;,; 2024-02-08 16:14:30]
[AMD and its (impressive?) P/E ratio,;,; I have a watchlist of 8 tech stocks and I was comparing the P/E ratios.  I see AMDs is largely out of place @ 1,084.39.  The other 7 (APPL, NVDA, GOOG, NVDA, TSLA, META, MSFT) and on average their P/E ratio is 48 (26:78).  So what gives?  Online I am reading that P/E is a gauge of investor sentiment on future growth in earning potential and is calculated based on prior 12 months of earnings.  AMDs P/E seems remarkable by comparison.  Does this not indicate that AMD is overbought?  edit: I was considering AMD for investment, given recent company news and its momentum has largely been positive over the long-term.  This number stands out to me, and it isn't a positive indicator in my mind.  Looking to reconcile my opinion after hearing some of yours - thanks!,;,; 2023-12-08 12:30:33]
[Nvidia launches custom chip business,;,; Nvidia is launching a custom chip business to capture cloud, automotive, telecom and other segments of custom chip opportunities.  Smart idea with solid foundation:  #1, Leadership in AI so a default "go to" for ML chips, 2, they will license their IP and know how, 3.  They will proliferated their CUDA software ecosystem ensuring a broader foot print for their platform.  4. Broad relationships with supply chains -- they will become king maker for the next SuperMicro -- on the chip level, 5. Nvidia pioneered use of AI in chip design, so it's a logical adjacent segment.  They're aiming at limiting guys like Broadcom and Marvel in the semicustom space.  AMD also has a semicustom chip business.  "Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon.com, Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for them, according to two sources familiar with the meetings. Beyond data center chips, the company has pursued telecom, automotive and video game customers.  In 2022, Nvidia said it would let third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking technology with their own chips."  Would also note one early customer identified:  "Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics processing unit (GPU) technology, according to two sources familiar with the talks.  [  Would note 18March is when Nvidia's GTC (GPU Technology Conference) starts, more to come.  edit: grammar/clarity,;,; 2024-02-09 14:41:00]

Was close to 18% until last year and we all know what happened.  - 40% VTI because I believe in diversification - 30% Big Tech because I believe in aggregation theory (MSFT, APPL, AMZN, BRKB) - 10% YOLO because I like to gamble (RKLB, ENPH, SNOW, NET, ILMN, ENVX, CCJ) - 5% PLTR because I work in data and they represent the greatest threat to my salary - 5% PSLDX in my Roth because fuck it (Long Stock/Bond 2x Leveraged ETF) - 10% Cash for dips (SGOV, SNSXX)  Sold GOOG, NVDA, TSLA, META, TSM on Monday.

[FEPI Looking like a better JEPQ. 25% yield, solid price performance,;,; If you're a fan of JEPQ/JEPI, keep an eye on FEPI.  It looks like it's shaping up to be an even better alternative.  By selling calls on targeted stocks it seems like it's able to generate more income than the JEPI/JEPQ approach.  There is some additional risk because it's a stock selection, rather than an approximation of the index.  But these are big name stocks. . .

[7 years from $0 to $100k, 3 years from $100k to $200k,;,; I joined eTrade in 2013 a few years after graduating college. I had set up automatic monthly contributions to my accounts, which I slowly raised over time and mostly invested in blue chip stocks.   On December 1, 2020, the combined value of my Roth and Traditional Brokerage account was just over $100k. It took me over seven years to get there and was a major milestone.  In the past three years, I have raised my monthly contributions, continued to invest, and am now just shy of $200k at the age of 35. You read about the power of compound gains all the time, but to go from $100k to $200k in three years when the first $100k took seven years is a testiment to that fact.  My goal is $1 mil by 47 and eventually to hit $2.5 mil before I retire.   For all you youngins out there, stick with it! But also, don't rush the process and try to hit home runs every day. For the most part, I am a buy and hold investor after a year or two of trying my hand at day trading with options and futures. When you chase the money, you won't make it. But if you‚Äôre patient with a decent risk tolerance, anything is possible.     Edit: Wow, thanks for the up votes everyone. It‚Äôs been fun reading the comments. Adding some context here based on some of the questions that have come in. Monthly contributions are at $1,000 a month now, but in the early years they were less. When I first started, it was $100 a month and I worked my way up from there. There was a good chunk of time where they were between $200-$500 a month. These accounts were set up on my own, no employer match. I‚Äôm not sure what my lifetime performance is, but the last three years I‚Äôm up 30% overall. All that in mind, I can confidently say that well over half of my account is due to investment gains.   Investments have been all individual stocks that I typically hold for a year or longer. I pick them based on both technical and fundamental factors. This is more risky than ETFs and index funds but it suits my investing style and risk tolerance. I try to stick to profitable companies with a stock price that has a history of moving in the right direction, however I also like to buy at a discount price. I keep my eyes on charts and when there‚Äôs opportunities to buy at historically undervalued prices I jump on it. There‚Äôs really nothing super special to it. Not going to share my current exact portfolio, but stocks I have owned in the past or currently include AAPL, GOOGL, META, COST, HD, MCD, DKNG, AMD, DIS, and BAC to name a few. There are many others I‚Äôm interested in buying that are on my watchlist.  I will also add that I‚Äôve made a ton of mistakes along the way. Bad investments, selling too soon when I should of just held, taking risky, over leveraged day trades that resulted in nasty losses and wash sales. However, I‚Äôve learned from them and never done anything bad enough that blew an account or resulted in a draw down that couldn‚Äôt be recovered. You can read all the books you want but I‚Äôve always found that the best way is to learn by doing and over time you develop your own skills and are able to trust your own analysis and decisions.,;,; 2023-11-18 16:51:37]

[S&amp;p 500 Tech vs NASDAQ 100 vs Stocks for AI,;,; Greetings!     I wanna invest into AI and cant decide whats the best call there. I think most will agree that the best bet for AI is to invest into the Big Companys: Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Meta, Google and Amazon. (Tesla not included because i dont like Elon tbh).     Investing into S&amp;P Tech will give me big Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA but not the other companys. Investing into NASDAQ 100 will give me all of them, but with a lower Rate (can be good can be bad). And of course i just can buy those 6 Stocks.     I think Apple (even if they dont have LLMs yet) will be big in AI in 1-2 Years and the capability shipping local AI on all of their devices are insane.  Huge potential here + we talk about Apple. Microsoft is playing the AI game better than anyone else right now and coming GPT Versions will slap. I also like the new approach of Meta and with LLAMA there is also huge Potential. NVIDIA is of course also a no brainer (even if some ppl think they are overvalued), they are way ahead of other companys like AMD right now. Amazon while not having insane LLMs right now, has of course on of the best Sectors to apply AI in general.     With alphabet i have to say, im not so sure. Their new Model is strong, but i kinda didn't feel good about the company as a whole. Hard to explain why.      What would you do and why if AI is the goal ?

[Zoominfo: Q4 Results and Dampened 2023 Outlook. Is Management being Conservative?,;,; Zoominfo (ZI -1.43%‚Üì) Q4 2022 revenue topped $300mn and registered an annual growth rate of 36%. Adjusted operating income margins exceeded 40%, which puts Zoominfo in a rare category of meaningful profitability among higher-growth technology companies. But the key issue with last evening‚Äôs financial report had to do with its outlook: 2023 is only projected to grow at high teens. Not bad for any company to be forecasting double digit growth in a recessionary environment, but expectations for Zoominfo had been higher, especially in the light of historical performance.  Key Highlights from Q4 2022 Report  The technology sector has been laying off employees since early-to-mid 2022 to reduce overheads and prepare for potentially weaker business volumes. Even giants like Salesforce (CRM -2.15%‚Üì) and Meta (META -2.25%‚Üì) could not avoid the fate as recessionary pressures continued unabated and markets demanded to see higher profitability.  With 40% of its customer base originating from the software vertical and a largely seat-base revenue model, Zoominfo faced increasingly stacked odds in 2022. While it had enjoyed extraordinary growth in tandem with prevalent hiring in the technology sector back in 2021, those tailwinds recently turned into headwinds.

[Is it recommended to buy stocks during a bear market and indexes during a bull market?,;,; When I first started out investing (Mid 2021), everything was really overvalued (imo. Didn't do much research). I ended up buying only low fee Total Market Indexes for the first year because I didn't feel like buying anything else. But ever since stocks started to fall en masse, I've been getting more and more tempted to buy individual stocks (GOOGL, MSFT, AAPL, DIS, META, AMZN) and haven't focused on buying ETFS. My portfolio went from 100% in one ETF to about 80% in it and the rest in stocks.   I have never sold a stock and only keep accumulating.

[Is the IT industry experiencing a growth spurt, or is this a bubble?,;,; Bernard Arnault, the head of LVMH, may be the wealthiest individual in the world, but IT companies still hold the title of the most valuable. Even following the recent market adjustment, **Apple** boasts a valuation exceeding $2.6 trillion, with **Microsoft** at $2.34 trillion, and **Alphabet** at $1.56 trillion.  How can this be? **Don't large tech firms also face the threat of economic downturns?**  Indeed, they do. However, the members of the MAMAA conglomerate (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet) took proactive measures to prepare for a potential economic slowdown by decreasing spending, which included a **reduction in labor costs**...  The recent **turbulence in the U.S. banking sector** has further funneled funds into the tech industry. Investors have shown a preference for companies boasting substantial profit margins and large cash reserves over more traditional safe-haven assets.  Another factor driving growth has been the **surge in Artificial Intelligence**. Investors anticipate that the capital injected into this sector will yield increased sales and, subsequently, elevated profits. Microsoft, for instance, anticipates a 6.7 percent revenue increase in the current quarter due to the rising demand for AI solutions.  Heading into 2023, the IT sector strikes a somewhat subdued chord: the Nasdaq Index suffered a decline of almost 33% in 2022. However, with **decreasing inflation** and the **prospect of a pause in Fed rate hikes**, tech stocks have regained their allure.  One also should not forget to note that key support propping up Nasdaq members was **stock buybacks**. Recall, too, that both Alphabet and Apple recently announced buybacks amounting to $70 billion and $90 billion respectively. Additionally, Meta, formerly Facebook, announced a stock buyback of $40 billion.  What lies on the horizon? **What are the analysts' predictions?**  Michael Landsberg, Chief Investment Officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management, asserts that [large tech stocks are currently overvalued]( For example, Microsoft shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 34.3, while Amazon's PE ratio (TTM) stands at 273.79.  On the other hand, analysts at Bank of America [do not foresee any reason for alarm]( and they predict that the flourishing market will persist.  So **what should we anticipate next?** If the Fed deviates from its hawkish stance, the rally could possibly extend. If not, the recent market correction may appear minor in comparison to what could transpire.

[Just how big are the Magnificent Seven?,;,; This is a big quote from MarketWatch. I‚Äôve seen the numbers before, but this really gave me pause.   &gt; These captains of the SS S&amp;P 500 are Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. They've been described as the magnificent seven by many news organizations. Fortunately for me, there's a common thread among this group. They are the only U.S. companies that have ever been valued at a trillion dollars by the public markets. To say these companies are dominating the S&amp;P 500 is a giant understatement. Last year, their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S&amp;P 500's valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65% of the Index's market cap gain last year, despite comprising just 1.4% of its components. But doesn't this go against the main reason behind investing in S&amp;P 500 index funds? Wouldn't the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed?  &gt; Phil Van Dorn: Well, I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry, traditionally, you might be looking at expenses of 1% of assets under management per year, and that can really pile up over time. But with an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund, your expenses get close to zero. But as you have mentioned when you called the group of expensive stocks the Trillionaires' Club, a small group of companies now make up between 27 and 30% of the S&amp;P 500 depending on which day you look at it.  &gt; Jeremy Owens: Right, so that's seven out of 500 companies accounting for more than a quarter or less than a third of the entire market cap of the S&amp;P 500 and really swaying the underlying metrics. What should an investor kind of take from this and how should we look at the S&amp;P 500 moving forward, knowing how much these companies matter?  &gt; Phil Van Dorn: One can say that there's a heck of a lot of risk in the seven companies that make up only 1% of the S&amp;P 500, but make up close to a third of its value. However, the S&amp;P 500 is self-correcting. It rewards success.,;,; 2024-01-20 00:51:08]
[Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market?,;,; Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market? I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity.  Then, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want.     It goes on and on. Looking at Palantir which trades at a crazy multiple, or basically any software company, yes it's possible to buy Palantir or any stock and it triple, but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words, Real INVESTING seems to be literally impossible right now.     Even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline.      And there are questions like how is this possible and is this partly due to extremely irresponsible Fed reserve activity mainly due to QE pushing valuations to their highest levels ever. Also do the people here think that this is the worst investing environment ever when compared to historical pe ratios?,;,; 2024-02-13 14:28:31]
[How many individual stocks in your eyes is too much?,;,; Out of curiosity how many individual stocks in your eyes is too much?   My train of thought behind my pickings is that I allocate the majority of my money to a world index so I‚Äôm not overweighting a particular sector or region but then allocate a small portion of my funds to individual stocks that I personally use day to day and have high confidence in.  For reference, 66% of my money is tied up in a world index (VWRL). 12% is tied up in small cap index funds. 50% in USA and 50% in Europe. (ZPRV and ZPRX)  11% is tied up in individual stocks. The list of stocks are:  Amazon - I use this quite frequently since I‚Äôm a member.  Apple - I use their tech.  Microsoft - familiar with their business model and use their software such as word and PowerPoint.  Meta - I use instagram and WhatsApp, I don‚Äôt use Facebook but its power in advertising is immense.  Johnson &amp; Johnson - leader in health such as vaccines.  Visa &amp; Mastercard - I personally use Mastercard but both are identical and leaders.  Alphabet - I use their software.  AMD - gaming as they‚Äôre used in Xbox and PlayStation plus their future in AI. Taking market share from intel.  Berkshire Hathaway - diversified  McDonald‚Äôs - real estate company that sells food.  JP Morgan - leading bank that is diversified.  Caterpillar - leading manufacture in mining/ agriculture/ construction machinery. Plus I‚Äôve got a placement sorted with them so there‚Äôs a bit of bias lol.  Nvidia - leader in AI and GPU production.  Walmart - powerhouse in America.  Costco - their membership model is cash flow powerhouse plus they‚Äôre present in numerous countries.  Waste management - trash will always be here.  ASML - absolute gem of a company and many years ahead of any competitors. Every tech company is reliant on them.  Airbus - I love planes and their business is far more desirable than Boeing.  Lockheed Martin - peace was never an option.  Once again, I‚Äôve chose to invest into these companies individually as I want to overweigh them as I‚Äôm more confident in them than others. I‚Äôm willing to put my money where my mouth is. I‚Äôm aware they‚Äôre contained in the world index. I don‚Äôt do any technical analysis, it‚Äôs all confidence and familiarity.  I also invest in REITs, I invest into leading REITs in each sector such as industrial, data etc. 11% of my portfolio is in REITs. 10 in total. I use alreits to track them, and track them quarterly.  I don‚Äôt plan on selling until retirement. Currently 19.  Thanks.,;,; 2024-02-17 17:00:00]
[Number of funds/ETF's ratio to total dollar amount,;,; Feeling somewhat overwhelmed with the amount of holdings.

[How would a fund that automatically purchases stocks that drop ~30-50%+ in a day perform?,;,; The core assumption of the fund would be that at least 50% percent of these drops are based on market overreactions that will eventually be corrected. And that large negative reactions are more likely to be overreactions. Or at least that the probability of them going up in combination with the lower price would make the expected value appealing. Also, the parameters (how large is the drop, over what period, and how long do you hold before selling) would need to be tinkered with, but I think you get the point. Maybe you even add some additional parameter related to fundamentals in, like as long as their credit rating is above BBB, as long as their leverage is below a certain point, as long as they're cash flow positive and have been around for at least 5 years. I don't know. You could take it in several directions. I'm sure someone with a data analysis background could run all sorts of regressions and shit analyzing what characteristics the funds that came back from a 30%+ drop tended to have in common.   Obviously I'm not saying this fund would necessarily be a winner, but I think it's at least worth exploring if only as an intellectual exercise. for instance, netflix dropped 35% in a day last year but has since climbed back 95%. meta dropped almost 30% in a day in the past year and they're up 26% from the point that 30% dropped from.,;,; 2023-03-03 13:08:16]
[Is setting up "no trades allowed" for account security a good idea?,;,; I recently heard about this Schwab scam  targeting Meta employees ( and growing a little paranoid. I did call them and set up my verbal password as well as ask them to make a note not to allow phone transactions. The rep said account notes can get overlooked so it's up to the agent whether they read it or not.  He did mention I could block all trades (online and phone) by setting up a "no trades allowed" policy on the account. It would be a bit of a hassle to unblock it when I do want to trade because it would have to go to their fraud department for clearance since they will need to verify my identity but would give me peace of mind.  Does anyone have any experience with setting up such a thing at your brokerage and did you face any unforeseen issues?

[Avantis AVGE Holdings Data/Study,;,; I'm developing an application related to ETF portfolios (the goal is to be able to analyze intersection, diversification between countries, categories, portfolio trend \[small to large, value to growth map\], etc).  Anyway. An ETF that I really like is **AVGE**, from Avantis. If I could summarize it in a few words, it would be the "VT with tendency to the value factor". It is a "fund of funds" with the following composition:  * Avantis U.S. Equity ETF (42.78%) * Avantis U.S. Large Cap Value ETF (15.05%) * Avantis International Equity ETF (10.89%) * Avantis Emerging Markets Equity ETF (6.37%) * Avantis International Large Cap Value ETF (5.49%) * Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (4.95%) * Avantis U.S Small Cap Equity ETF (4.86%) * Avantis Emerging Markets Value ETF (4.28%) * Avantis Real Estate ETF (3.00%) * Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF (2.17%) * State Street Institutional Investment Trust US Government Money Market Fund Institutional (0.09%)  I got this information from the website [etf.com/avge]( But I would like to go further. I would not like to see the funds that make up these funds, I want to see the holdings that make up the funds of that fund.  So, with a little bit of programming I was able to extract this information and publish it in this github repository. There are two CSV, of which:  * [avge-holdings-ungrouped.csv]( In this CSV I have not grouped the repeated companies. You will be able to see the weight of each holding in each of the funds. Example: APPL represents 4.78% of AVUS (which represents 42.78% of AVGE) and at the same time represents 2.98% of AVLV (which represents 15.05% of AVGE). * [avge-holdings-grouped.csv]( This CSV shows the actual participation of a given company in AVGE. So, for example, the APPL that is part of AVUS and AVLG, its real weight is 2.49% (4.78%\*42.78% + 2.98%\*15.05%).  And, just to make the post more graphic, I end with the list of the 10 biggest AVGE positions.  |Name|Ticker|Weight| |:-|:-|:-| |Apple Inc.|AAPL|2.49%| |Microsoft Corporation|MSFT|1.56%| |Exxon Mobil Corporation|XOM|0.92%| |Meta Platforms Inc. Class A|META|0.85%| |JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co|JPM|0.80%| |Chevron Corporation|CVX|0.77%| |Merck &amp; Co., Inc|MRK|0.76%| |Alphabet Inc. Class A|GOOGL|0.63%| |Pfizer Inc|PFE|0.56%| |Alphabet Inc. Class C|GOOG|0.55%|  The fund's 10 largest positions add up to **9.91%**. It's a pretty small value when compared to growth ETFs like QQQ, VUG, etc.  # Next goals (which I will do when I have time):  * Compare the percentage portfolio between AVGE and VT; * Get the country and sector of each of the 9824 holdings. In this way I will be able to carry out a study of the geographic and sectorial diversification of AVGE. I'll probably use ChatGPT to help me with this because I haven't found any api that can give me this information easily.,;,; 2023-04-20 19:01:28]

[Parking a large amount of money for a month between two houses,;,; So we are in the middle of selling our old house and buying a new house. We will buy the new house cash, so no financing issues. Here is the issue: we need to park a good amount of money (way over the $250k) for about 4-6 weeks and I am worried about keeping it all on a regular bank account because of Silicon Valley bank, etc.   In the past I did CDARS where my bank would distribute the money over several different banks in tranches of $250k each and therefore it would all be FDIC insured. However this process isn‚Äôt practical for a month or so since it takes about a week for it to be deposited and the shortest time period is about one month.

Put it into my Schwab or Interactive Brokers account and buy a super short term fund or something like that with a AAA risk.   Does anyone know any good money market type funds that are super short ans therefore have very limited interest rate risk?   Or any other ideas?  Thanks!!,;,; 2023-04-29 10:33:41]

[Why Google is the entity needed to avoid an abusive AI domination,;,; I will start saying that MSFT investors are now less impressed and starting to worry. Google killed it yesterday at the conference. They have integrated AI into their G-Suite (Gmail, Google Docs and sheet), search engine and a bunch of other tools that I don't even know what the heck they are but they sure are cool.  Google could become the leading "trustworthy" AI company everyone is looking at. I was a little worried about this Zuckertard 2.0 named Sam Altman, who talks like a freaking robot and who the hell knows what he's doing with your data (yeah, you haven't read his terms when you signed up). None of his back and forth podcasts in the last few months convinced me, more like made him suspicious.  Sundra Pichai said yesterday that Google will meta tag all AI-created images from day 1, including a nice watermark on them. Also, it launched a fact check tool to find out if the content or news is misleading or not (the big concern with all this AI boom)  I have already seen a few dangerous applications our there. For example some people on LinkedIn happy with many new releases that are illegal under the Data Privacy Act. Things like you can use an AI website where you put a name and it gives you a lot of social media information about this person, or prompt the AI the profile you need to recruit and it will pull up a lot of profiles with photos, information from career, social media information of candidates who are suitable, with their email addresses. I never authorized my profile to be on these AI sites other than LinkedIn (which I kept private and visible only to HR profiles), and now my profile, picture, and info.   Google will become the voice politicians, regulators and society is looking at. Beucaseu they are in the business since the late 90's. They know what regulations means. They went through a lot of issues, solved them and survived.   I hold a ton of share in Google and this is not a financial advice.,;,; 2023-05-11 14:16:00]
[In Defense of Dividends (On a Million $ Portfolio),;,; To start with, I'm 41 years old, and have been investing since I was 22. Right now, my portfolio is just around a million dollars - still waiting to get a $87k tax refund from the government. Here's a screenshot of my portfolio:  [  Edit: The portfolio total is in Canadian dollars. So convert US holdings like SCHD, VOO, IBTG etc from USD to CAD, and the total should add up.  Edit 2: You'll see that I'm not exclusively chasing dividends either. I have VOO, AVUV etc that have pretty poor dividends.  As you can see, I have a strong dividend tilt. I'm not trying to squeeze 7% or 8% from my portfolio. I think 3-4% is a good balance between growth and dividends.  Yesterday, I saw a long polemic about "young" investors chasing dividends: [  While I'm not exactly old, I'm not exactly young either. And here's why I think the poster is wrong about dividends.  **The Arguments for Dividends**  *1. We all Know that Dividends are not free money*  No investor thinks that dividends are "free money". Obviously money doesn't grow on trees, and we all know it has to come from somewhere. People often use this as a "gotcha", but it's a straw man. Is there any reasonable investor who thinks dividends spring from the earth?  No. Everyone knows that dividends come from a company's assets. So let's get that out of the way.  *2. Wealth is an Income Stream, Not Capital*  At a fundamental level, I don't care about stock prices. I care about only two things:  a) What is my income stream?  b) How fast is that income stream growing?  Anyone reading an old Charles Dickens book knows that the English used to measure a person's wealth, not by how much they have, but by how much income was coming in. For example, here's a quote from Great Expectations:  **"His rise in the world was not much appreciated by Mrs. Pocket, who had a decided inaptitude for doing anything to an amount. But, Biddy, he was five hundred a year"**  In his book "The Four Pillars of Investing", Bernstein makes the same point. He says that at some time, Americans became enamored with the number in their brokerage account and started talking about wealth as if it were a static number.  For me, I don't care about the value of my brokerage account. I care about its income stream. No income stream? Then you're poor. At least for me. Doesn't matter if I have a million dollars in my brokerage.  *3. Dividends ARE From a Company's Earnings*  For some reason, the poster bring up bad companies who sell assets to pay dividends. There are bad companies everywhere. We don't use them as examples to make a point. Good companies earn money, and pay dividends from those earnings. This isn't hard to understand.  *4. Companies Overestimate their Ability to Re-invest their Earnings into Growth*  Here's the big one. The theory goes that companies that don't pay dividends will re-invest that money into even more growth. Tax efficient growth! Who doesn't want that?  Anyone reading this, who works for a public company, will know exactly how much money is wasted on bureaucracy, corporate management, bonuses, and all kinds of junk. Just last year, we were treated to the news that tech companies wasted billions of dollars hiring people to do nothing. What a waste! As shareholders, you should have been outraged. **That money was yours**. It's human nature to waste money. It is beyond the ability of any human being to be prudent with money in the face of a river of cash with no accountability. Dividends impose fiscal discipline.  For a company to retain dividends, they need to *generate a higher return than their own current cashflow*. In other words, they need a higher Internal Rate of Return (IRR) than what they have right now. That''s a huge ask for any company to do consistently over years. You think Google is profitable right now? Well, they're promising that they'll get even *more* profitable over the years. If you think this can continue forever...well, that's your gamble to make.  *5. Re-investing Dividends Gets you more of the Same Proven Cash Flow*  When you re-invest your dividends, you're purchasing more of the same cashflow that the company has proven **they can already generate**. It's not pie-in-the-sky "trust me bro" cashflow. You know the company's track record. You know its record of dividend growth. You're buying more of the same. It's more secure.  *6. A Company is Not the Same as its Stock*  The English used to have a saying:  **"Milk from the cows, eggs from the hens. A stock, by God, for its dividends!"**  People mistakenly think that a company and its stock are the same thing. They are not. A stock is a financial instrument that is valued only for its current or future cash flow. A company is well...a company.  For example, Google is a great company. Cash rich, and growing. It's stock, however, is dog shit. It pays nothing, and I value it as 0.  *7. When a Company Fails, All You're Left with is Dividends*  Companies grow and die. During the life cycle of a company, the only value it ever actually returns to its shareholders is through dividends. During liquidation, chances are that it's in distress and that shareholders won't get the value of the company's assets, so that's a poor way to ensure you get something out of it in the end.  Imagine the journey of Meta. It grows to tremendous heights, and 30 years later is dies. At the end of it, what did shareholders get if it paid no dividends? When a company finally closes its doors, you will be glad that it paid you dividends. At least you got something out of it.  *8. Without Dividends (Present or Future) a Stock is No different from Bitcoin*  What makes Bitcoin a joke? The lack of cashflow. What gives a house value? The cashflow - either directly from rent, or the amount of rent you save from living in it.  What gives a stock value? Not company earnings, which have no impact on you. Dividends. By god, dividends! People who substitute company earnings for dividends are making the mistake as point (6). A company is not the same as its stock.  *9. I Invest Based on the Gordon Equation*  The Gordon equation (a variation of the dividend discount model) is simple:  Expected yield = Current yield + growth of that yield.  For example, Microsoft's yield is low. But it's growing that yield fast, so I consider it. Google pays nothing. I value it at zero.  **Bottom Line**  No one denies that companies need to retain *some* earnings to grow. No one is demanding that you chase yields and expect 5, 6, 7, or 8% dividends. 3 or 4% is plenty. Leaves enough for the company to continue growing, imposes decent fiscal discipline on a company's cashflow, and returns actual value to shareholders.  That's my strategy, and I'm sticking to it.  Edit: For those of you reaching out, worried about me being attacked here, don't worry. I'm 41 years and a grown ass adult. Words won't hurt me :),;,; 2023-07-30 14:49:10]
[Empower vs. Fidelity Recommendation - advice on specific situation,;,; Hi,    My fianc√© (35) is considering transferring the majority of her retirement funds from Fidelity to Empower.

A random $800 from an older 401K that needs to be rolled over.    The main question she is wondering if she should roll both Fidelity accounts into the Empower My Total Retirement program.  She had a meeting with them and they said that if she did there would be no advisory fee.  The plan documents for their 401K say there is a quarterly fee of 0.1125%.  The Premier Retirement Advisory services has a fee of 0.50%/year plus another 0.4% for the next 150K.She is looking for some input on a few questions ‚Äì     1)	Is the my total retirement annual the same as the advisory fee they said they would waive?     2)	Is there a transaction fee to buy/sell even if the advisory is managing the transactions?  There seems to be charges for each transaction in her 401K and she is currently signed up for the My Total Retirement Program.    3)	I think she would need to liquidate the Fidelity zero funds if she moved to Empower and that would be a taxable event.  Is that accurate?    4)	Most importantly, would it be worth it to move the Fidelity funds to Empower and have them manage it?  And if it is not worth it, should she stop the My Total Retirement program at Empower to save on fees and just keep running the self directed 401K?    My idea with recommending the Fidelity funds to her initially was the zero expense ratio for some of the funds above.      TIA for any advice.,;,; 2023-05-14 20:00:34]
[First-time Poster (go easy),;,; TLDR: Swapping from Edward Jones to Schwab and looking for traditional IRA and other recommendations. \*Apologies for the following novel!      Hey folks, I am looking for some strategic advice. I started investing three years ago when I finished active-duty military service. My wife and I stupidly didn‚Äôt save or invest any money during my 20 years of service, so no IRAs or TSP starting off. We collectively were living paycheck-to-paycheck during my military service based on terrible spending habits.      In 2021 we sold a house which netted us around $150k. We bought another (at 2.499 interest) but put very little down because we used our VA loan and I wanted to feel the security of having cash on hand. We have kept the rest of the proceeds in the breakdown below. Not really knowing what I was doing, I opened accounts with Edward Jones and started throwing money at it. We were able to open the Roth's based on my income then, but have since become ineligible to add to those due to high income. Also, we bought all of the individual stocks and watched them plummet in 2022, but they have since recovered and we are basically back where we started.      Fast-forward to now, we still spend what I consider a ridiculous amount of money every month, but we are working to correct it and double-down on investing for retirement. I started working with a great company that does a 5% match with John Hancock, and I am maxing that contribution every year (about $20k) with 75% into RFHTX and 25% into the 500 Index Fund. I am not looking to change that allocation unless folks have a compelling recommendation. Additionally, we have roughly $5k/month that is unused (saved) and put in our normal bank savings account which is really giving us no return, about 60 dollars a month, so not really sure what to do there‚Ä¶ I should note that I plan to work for at least the next 15-20 years and expect my current income level to remain static or increase.      So my questions are:     \-	As we are moving into Schwab, what index funds or ETFs would make the most sense for the Roth IRAs?    \-	Should we be maxing out Traditional IRAs with the intent to do a backdoor conversion later?     \-	What should be done with the cash that we have in our bank‚Äôs low-interest savings account?    \-	Are we on track or do I need to make some drastic move like taking savings and paying off vehicles / dropping the savings into my mortgage to reduce it / other?        One thought I have is to make the transition to Schwab and put the Roth‚Äôs/529s into whatever the advisor recommends. Then liquidating the $50,000 in individual stocks from EJ, put that money into a MMF with Schwab and use that money to fund Traditional IRAs for my wife and I. Would this be a smart move?        Below are some of our financial stats:    Age: 44 ‚Äì seeking to retire between 60-65 y.o.    Current take home (net) income: $20,000/mo    \-	$12,000 from employment    \-	$8,000 from military retirement &amp; VA disability    Monthly bills: $10,000/month    Discretionary spending: $5,000/mo    Current 401k: $88,000    (Edward Jones) Existing Roth IRAs: $20,000    USAA Savings account: $90,000    (Edward Jones) Kid‚Äôs 529s: $8,000 (although both kids have GI Bill, so won‚Äôt likely ‚Äúneed‚Äù the 529s)    (Edward Jones) Individual stock positions: $50,000    \-	Alphabet (100 shares)    \-	Amazon (60)    \-	Apple (50)    \-	Blackrock (5)    \-	Duke Energy (10)    \-	Meta (20)    \-	Microsoft (10)    \-	Southwest (100)    \-	Disney (20)    ,;,; 2023-07-29 17:02:26]
[What allocation approach is implied by Toby Nangle's new FT article on narrow markets driving equity returns?,;,; What I take from the article below is not to rely too much on a macro-driven asset allocation strategy.  But what asset allocation strategy makes sense in this environment then?    &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;    /content/c5d7ee71-92a2-4840-9344-2f62e9642e61  # Narrow markets should humble macro forecasters  5-6 minutes   2023-08-08   Toby Nangle    The writer is a former global head of asset allocation at a fund manager   This year has been marked by strong equity markets, and what looks to be an astonishingly narrow rally. Of the 16.9 per cent returned by the S&amp;P 500 index in the first half of this year, 12.9 per cent derived from the performance of only 10 companies.   With such a high proportion of a market‚Äôs value created by so few groups, it feels fair to question the tool kits of asset allocators and, more broadly, the product line-up of fund management firms.   Narrow stock market returns are, after all, the norm. Research by Arizona State University professor Hendrik Bessembinder shows that more than half of the $55.1tn in net wealth generated by the US equity market between 1926 and 2022 came from the performance of fewer than 0.3 per cent of the market‚Äôs stocks, with the other half of this net wealth coming from the next best 3.1 per cent of stocks.   Moreover, almost three-fifths of stocks actually destroyed wealth over the period. In quant-speak, the distribution of compound stock returns has been very positively skewed.   In addition, the skewness of equity returns turns out not to be a particularly North American phenomenon. Indeed, in the three decades ending in December 2020 the proportion of net wealth contributed by the best 1 per cent of emerging market stocks was more than 80 per cent.   Looking at the entire global stock universe outside the US, the proportion rises still further to more than 90 per cent. Winners have won big. Most individual stocks over the past 30 years have failed to outperform dollars stored under the mattress, let alone a local currency interest-bearing cash deposits ‚Äî even after taking into account dividends.   Bessembinder‚Äôs work has typically been surveyed in terms of what it means for active stockpickers ‚Äî with some seeing it as a rationalisation for chasing moonshots and others for pursuing passive index-investing. Less examined has been what it means for asset allocators.   Developed market stock index returns have been dominated by global companies ‚Äî even if they each carry a domestic tilt. As such, connecting local macroeconomic developments to the performance of a region‚Äôs equity index can be something of a dark art.   Single large stocks with an economic fate that has little to do with their listing jurisdiction have dominated national index returns. For example, the photolithography machine-maker ASML accounts for more than a fifth of the total net wealth created by Dutch stocks in the 30 years up to 2020. Global fast-fashion retailer Inditex accounts for more than a sixth of Spanish stock returns. Global luxury brands LVMH and L‚ÄôOr√©al collectively account for almost a quarter of the returns from French stocks. These are not outliers. One cannot explain long-term returns without reference to such companies in pretty much any region.   If it becomes hard to explain equity index returns without reference to specific superstar groups, it stands to reason that it must be even harder to forecast equity index returns without taking a view on some individual companies. It‚Äôs easy today to focus on whether the Magnificent Seven that have powered the S&amp;P 500 rally ‚Äî Apple, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta ‚Äî might stumble. With more than a quarter of the US market‚Äôs valuation riding on them, the question is not at all trivial. But 30 years ago, five of these seven had not even listed. It‚Äôs hard to take a view on companies that don‚Äôt yet exist.   I‚Äôve been as guilty as the next asset allocator in explaining my preference for US over European stocks or vice versa with reference to some domestic macroeconomic outlook. Given that financials, utilities and property groups will carry a strong domestic flavour, this is still forgivable.   But when constructing a long-term strategic asset allocation, it is becoming increasingly untenable to justify regional preferences with reference to local macroeconomic forecasts. This may explain why long-term return forecasts for equity markets ‚Äî or Capital Market Assumptions, as they are known ‚Äî have such a lousy record.   The biggest single investment decision any institutional or individual investor is likely to make in their portfolio is their choice of strategic asset allocation. To create a strategic asset allocation one must make reasonable guesses about future market returns. Bessembinder‚Äôs research shows quite how invariably such reasonable guesses will be blindsided by the fate of single stocks.,;,; 2023-08-08 12:11:15]

[Booking Holdings stock analysis (Burry's 4th Largest Holding),;,; Hi everyone, I hope you are all well. I want to share my thoughts on Booking as a company since I think Booking is interesting. If you're looking for a superficial analysis and don't like reading, look elsewhere. This isn't a superficial analysis, which is what is typically shared. I'll share why I think Booking might be differentiated from major competitors like Expedia and AirBnb. I'll also do an overview of the economics of the business, then write about the industry and competitors and estimate the intrinsic value. As I am sure all of you know, this is just my thoughts so please do your own research. I hope I provide some insights and I welcome an exchange of ideas.  # Company Overview:  Booking is an online travel agency (OTA). It is a parent company that holds a number of brands such as Booking, KAYAK, RentalCars, Priceline, Agoda and Opentable. As a whole, Booking provides reservation services for customers looking for accommodations, flights, rental cars, taxis, and restaurants. There is a lot interplay between these brands.  Booking categories their revenue as Agency, Merchant &amp; Advertising &amp; Other:  Revenue *(In millions)*  ||**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**|**2015**|2014| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Agency|$9,003|$6,663|$4,314|$10,117|$10,480|$9,714|$7,982|$6,527|$5,845| |Merchant|$7,193|$3,696|$2,117|$3,830|$2,987|$1,891|$1,620|$1,450|$1,329| |Advertising &amp; Other|$894|$599|$365|$1,119|$1,060|$834|$713|$613|$410| |**Total**|**$17,090**|**$10,958**|**$6,796**|**$15,066**|**$14,527**|**$12,439**|**$10,314**|**$8,591**|**$7,584**|  Booking mainly generates revenue on commissions. Agency revenue is when Booking makes a reservation for a customer but does not facilitate payment; the supplier (hotels, airlines, etc) will follow up with the customer for payment. Merchant revenue is when Booking acts as a merchant; i.e. collect payment and remits payment to supplier. Bookings earns commission on both of these categories.  Merchant revenue is catching up and increasing its percentage as a proportion of total revenue and although this doesn't negatively impact Booking in regards to its position in the industry, it does negatively impact their margins.  Operating Margins:   |**2014**|**2015**|**2016**|**2017**|**2018**|**2019**|**2020**|**2021**|**2022**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |42.2%|40.5%|37.92%|28.18%|36.48%|36.7%|35.48%|\-9.28%|22.78%|  \*We can see that as the merchant category increases as a proportion of sales, operating margins are decreasing. Merchant revenue incurs additional expenses.  ***Advertising &amp; Other*** is revenue mainly earned by KAYAK for its meta-search platform: This platform lists hotel chains, flights, etc on its website. ***I am going to disregard this segment because Google Flights does the same thing, so I am estimating no growth here. Some people view Google as a competitor to Booking, and they do compete against KAYAK. However, Google benefits Booking's Agency and Merchant business since Google refers a lot of people to Bookings platforms. Google is ultimately an advertising business, they don't make reservations or facilitate payments.***  Marketing Expense as a % of Total Revenue:   |**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**|**2015**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |35%|34.6%|32%|32.9%|34.1%|36.2%|35.4%|35%|  \* Booking spends a lot on marketing and a lot of this spend is performance marketing on Google.

Room nights have been increasing significantly in geographical areas (like Asia-Pacific) which has lower average daily rates compared to areas like Europe and the U.S. This also impacts their margins.  # Competitors:  Bookings Mix of Room nights for hotels and alternative accommodation:  |||||| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| ||**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**| |Hotels, Motels, Resorts|70%|71%|\--|71%| |Alternative|30%|29%|\--|29%|  **AirBnb:**  The way I am thinking about this is 70% of Bookings accommodations are in hotels and motels and AirBnb mainly generate revenue from homes, holiday houses etc. This is only 30% of Bookings business, which they list as alternative. Although these two companies compete, I don't think it will affect Booking if Airbnb continues to grow since they don't specialise in hotel accommodations. I am curious to know your thoughts about this.  **Website Traffic:**  Expedia: 88.68% website traffic in the U.S.  Airbnb: 71.54% website traffic in the U.S  ***Booking: 10.86% website traffic in the U.S***  Most of Bookings website traffic is concentrated in Europe whereas Expedia and Airbnb is concentrated in the U.S. I believe this has other implications, especially when I compare Booking with Expedia that has a business model that is almost identical. Most of the hotel chains in the U.S are very popular: Marriott, Holiday Inn, Hilton, Hampton Inn and Hyatt to name a few. They have their own loyalty programs and big marketing and merchandising (cheap deals) campaigns and customers often seek these hotels out directly, although they are listed on Expedia as well. Since they are popular, they have bargaining power and can request lower commissions to be listed on an OTA. Since Expedia is heavily concentrated in the United States, this has an impact on their margins. Most of Bookings hotel suppliers are outside of the U.S. and these are often smaller, independent chains that rely more heavily on an OTA.  Expedia operating margins:  |**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |10.2%|3%|\-29.4%|8%|7%|6.6%|  \*I think this explains why Expedia's margins are a lot lower than Booking despite similar business models.  # Industry:  OTA industry estimates suggest it will grow to over $1 trillion at the end of 2030. It is currently at $521 billion. Estimated growth is just over 10%.  # Intrinsic Value Estimate:  Historical data *(in mill)*:  &amp;#x200B;  ||**2023 (estimate)**|**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |**FCF**|$7,054|$5,913|$2,243|\-$456|$4,318|$4,882|$4,398|$3,694| |**Percentage Change**|19.3%|163.6%|591%|\-110%|\-11.5%|11%|19%|33.45%| |**ROIC**|53.47%|43%|12.3%|\-3.37%|29.61%|26.67%|23.9%|23.1%|  Growth rates:  &amp;#x200B;  |**Growth Rates**|**1-yr**|**3-yr**|**5-yr**|**7-yr**|**9-yr**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Revenue|25%|47%|8%|11%|12%| |FCF|19%|N/A (COVID)|8%|10%|11%|  I have taken the current year FCF estimate (2023 FY results isn't out yet), and have estimated a growth rate of 8% in yrs 1-5 and 6% in yrs 6-10, discount rate of 10% and terminal value of 20. The growth rates are estimated because of the industry growth projections and Bookings position in the market. Also the 5-year previous growth rates for Booking was 8%, which was the lowest compared to my 1-3-7 and 9 years growth rates so I went with that. 8% is a lower growth rate than the industry growth projections and I wanted to be conservative, especially since the FCF in the current year is at record highs. I always like putting a lower growth rate in the latter half (6%) because it is a lot harder to estimate. The discount rate is high, however, my style has always been to make fewer bets for higher returns and I am happy being patient until those opportunities arrive. This gave me an intrinsic value of $4,296. I try and go a bit further to see if I can get a discount to intrinsic value.

Will Threads be yet another Meta flop like their metaverse or do you think it can somehow increase users again?  I think most people signed up because it was easy to do if you already had an instagram account but having logged in the past couple of days i hardly see anybody posting anything there.

[Facebook-parent Meta forecasts quarterly revenue above estimates,;,; July 26 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms (META.O) forecast third-quarter revenue above market expectations on Wednesday, anticipating higher ad spending on signs of improving macroeconomic environment.  The company expects July-September revenue in the range $32 billion to $34.5 billion, compared to analysts' average estimate of $31.30 billion, according to Refinitiv data.  Shares surged 7% in after-market trading, as Meta also beat second-quarter revenue estimates.  Revenue grew 11% to $32 billion in the quarter ended June, compared to analysts' average estimate of $31.12 billion.  Link to article:   Personal thoughts: Meta stock is up at around 5% AH at the moment, and after Google/MSFT‚Äôs earning it seems like the tech giants are doing as well as anyone can hope for so far.

[Just how big are the Magnificent Seven?,;,; This is a big quote from MarketWatch. I‚Äôve seen the numbers before, but this really gave me pause.   &gt; These captains of the SS S&amp;P 500 are Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. They've been described as the magnificent seven by many news organizations. Fortunately for me, there's a common thread among this group. They are the only U.S. companies that have ever been valued at a trillion dollars by the public markets. To say these companies are dominating the S&amp;P 500 is a giant understatement. Last year, their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S&amp;P 500's valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65% of the Index's market cap gain last year, despite comprising just 1.4% of its components. But doesn't this go against the main reason behind investing in S&amp;P 500 index funds? Wouldn't the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed?  &gt; Phil Van Dorn: Well, I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry, traditionally, you might be looking at expenses of 1% of assets under management per year, and that can really pile up over time. But with an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund, your expenses get close to zero. But as you have mentioned when you called the group of expensive stocks the Trillionaires' Club, a small group of companies now make up between 27 and 30% of the S&amp;P 500 depending on which day you look at it.  &gt; Jeremy Owens: Right, so that's seven out of 500 companies accounting for more than a quarter or less than a third of the entire market cap of the S&amp;P 500 and really swaying the underlying metrics. What should an investor kind of take from this and how should we look at the S&amp;P 500 moving forward, knowing how much these companies matter?  &gt; Phil Van Dorn: One can say that there's a heck of a lot of risk in the seven companies that make up only 1% of the S&amp;P 500, but make up close to a third of its value. However, the S&amp;P 500 is self-correcting. It rewards success.,;,; 2024-01-20 00:51:08]
[Nvidia launches custom chip business,;,; Nvidia is launching a custom chip business to capture cloud, automotive, telecom and other segments of custom chip opportunities.  Smart idea with solid foundation:  #1, Leadership in AI so a default "go to" for ML chips, 2, they will license their IP and know how, 3.  They will proliferated their CUDA software ecosystem ensuring a broader foot print for their platform.  4. Broad relationships with supply chains -- they will become king maker for the next SuperMicro -- on the chip level, 5. Nvidia pioneered use of AI in chip design, so it's a logical adjacent segment.  They're aiming at limiting guys like Broadcom and Marvel in the semicustom space.  AMD also has a semicustom chip business.  "Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon.com, Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for them, according to two sources familiar with the meetings. Beyond data center chips, the company has pursued telecom, automotive and video game customers.  In 2022, Nvidia said it would let third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking technology with their own chips."  Would also note one early customer identified:  "Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics processing unit (GPU) technology, according to two sources familiar with the talks.

[Avantis AVGE Holdings Data/Study,;,; I'm developing an application related to ETF portfolios (the goal is to be able to analyze intersection, diversification between countries, categories, portfolio trend \[small to large, value to growth map\], etc).  Anyway. An ETF that I really like is **AVGE**, from Avantis. If I could summarize it in a few words, it would be the "VT with tendency to the value factor". It is a "fund of funds" with the following composition:  * Avantis U.S. Equity ETF (42.78%) * Avantis U.S. Large Cap Value ETF (15.05%) * Avantis International Equity ETF (10.89%) * Avantis Emerging Markets Equity ETF (6.37%) * Avantis International Large Cap Value ETF (5.49%) * Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (4.95%) * Avantis U.S Small Cap Equity ETF (4.86%) * Avantis Emerging Markets Value ETF (4.28%) * Avantis Real Estate ETF (3.00%) * Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF (2.17%) * State Street Institutional Investment Trust US Government Money Market Fund Institutional (0.09%)  I got this information from the website [etf.com/avge]( But I would like to go further. I would not like to see the funds that make up these funds, I want to see the holdings that make up the funds of that fund.  So, with a little bit of programming I was able to extract this information and publish it in this github repository. There are two CSV, of which:  * [avge-holdings-ungrouped.csv]( In this CSV I have not grouped the repeated companies. You will be able to see the weight of each holding in each of the funds. Example: APPL represents 4.78% of AVUS (which represents 42.78% of AVGE) and at the same time represents 2.98% of AVLV (which represents 15.05% of AVGE). * [avge-holdings-grouped.csv]( This CSV shows the actual participation of a given company in AVGE. So, for example, the APPL that is part of AVUS and AVLG, its real weight is 2.49% (4.78%\*42.78% + 2.98%\*15.05%).  And, just to make the post more graphic, I end with the list of the 10 biggest AVGE positions.  |Name|Ticker|Weight| |:-|:-|:-| |Apple Inc.|AAPL|2.49%| |Microsoft Corporation|MSFT|1.56%| |Exxon Mobil Corporation|XOM|0.92%| |Meta Platforms Inc. Class A|META|0.85%| |JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co|JPM|0.80%| |Chevron Corporation|CVX|0.77%| |Merck &amp; Co., Inc|MRK|0.76%| |Alphabet Inc. Class A|GOOGL|0.63%| |Pfizer Inc|PFE|0.56%| |Alphabet Inc. Class C|GOOG|0.55%|  The fund's 10 largest positions add up to **9.91%**. It's a pretty small value when compared to growth ETFs like QQQ, VUG, etc.  # Next goals (which I will do when I have time):  * Compare the percentage portfolio between AVGE and VT; * Get the country and sector of each of the 9824 holdings. In this way I will be able to carry out a study of the geographic and sectorial diversification of AVGE. I'll probably use ChatGPT to help me with this because I haven't found any api that can give me this information easily.,;,; 2023-04-20 19:01:28]
[[M25] International Student in the US - How to prepare to move assets overseas,;,; Hi, I am a student set to graduate by December of this year. My graduate student stipend is 33K a year (2.5K a month post-tax and health insurance). I am on an F-1 visa, my wife is on an F-2 visa. My wife nor I are from the US, we might stay for another 3 years with my OPT authorization. However, we are looking for a more stable environment ASAP (not having to worry about visas).  I am from South America and my wife is Eastern European. I am confortable with leaving the Roth IRA investments in the US until we are of retirement age. However, I am not sure if Robinhood is the most friendly platform for people who do not longer reside in the US, what other alternatives are there? We have the most job opportunities available in places like Germany, Canada, and the UK. I have a job offer after graduation in the US, salary will be 100K in a mid-high cost of living area, no promises of H1B sponsorship. I do not wish to delay our life and family goals due to the uncertainty of visa legislations. Here is a little more detail about our financial situation.

[Booking Holdings stock analysis (Burry's 4th Largest Holding),;,; Hi everyone, I hope you are all well. I want to share my thoughts on Booking as a company since I think Booking is interesting. If you're looking for a superficial analysis and don't like reading, look elsewhere. This isn't a superficial analysis, which is what is typically shared. I'll share why I think Booking might be differentiated from major competitors like Expedia and AirBnb. I'll also do an overview of the economics of the business, then write about the industry and competitors and estimate the intrinsic value. As I am sure all of you know, this is just my thoughts so please do your own research. I hope I provide some insights and I welcome an exchange of ideas.  # Company Overview:  Booking is an online travel agency (OTA). It is a parent company that holds a number of brands such as Booking, KAYAK, RentalCars, Priceline, Agoda and Opentable. As a whole, Booking provides reservation services for customers looking for accommodations, flights, rental cars, taxis, and restaurants. There is a lot interplay between these brands.  Booking categories their revenue as Agency, Merchant &amp; Advertising &amp; Other:  Revenue *(In millions)*  ||**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**|**2015**|2014| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Agency|$9,003|$6,663|$4,314|$10,117|$10,480|$9,714|$7,982|$6,527|$5,845| |Merchant|$7,193|$3,696|$2,117|$3,830|$2,987|$1,891|$1,620|$1,450|$1,329| |Advertising &amp; Other|$894|$599|$365|$1,119|$1,060|$834|$713|$613|$410| |**Total**|**$17,090**|**$10,958**|**$6,796**|**$15,066**|**$14,527**|**$12,439**|**$10,314**|**$8,591**|**$7,584**|  Booking mainly generates revenue on commissions. Agency revenue is when Booking makes a reservation for a customer but does not facilitate payment; the supplier (hotels, airlines, etc) will follow up with the customer for payment. Merchant revenue is when Booking acts as a merchant; i.e. collect payment and remits payment to supplier. Bookings earns commission on both of these categories.  Merchant revenue is catching up and increasing its percentage as a proportion of total revenue and although this doesn't negatively impact Booking in regards to its position in the industry, it does negatively impact their margins.  Operating Margins:   |**2014**|**2015**|**2016**|**2017**|**2018**|**2019**|**2020**|**2021**|**2022**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |42.2%|40.5%|37.92%|28.18%|36.48%|36.7%|35.48%|\-9.28%|22.78%|  \*We can see that as the merchant category increases as a proportion of sales, operating margins are decreasing. Merchant revenue incurs additional expenses.  ***Advertising &amp; Other*** is revenue mainly earned by KAYAK for its meta-search platform: This platform lists hotel chains, flights, etc on its website. ***I am going to disregard this segment because Google Flights does the same thing, so I am estimating no growth here. Some people view Google as a competitor to Booking, and they do compete against KAYAK. However, Google benefits Booking's Agency and Merchant business since Google refers a lot of people to Bookings platforms. Google is ultimately an advertising business, they don't make reservations or facilitate payments.***  Marketing Expense as a % of Total Revenue:   |**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**|**2015**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |35%|34.6%|32%|32.9%|34.1%|36.2%|35.4%|35%|  \* Booking spends a lot on marketing and a lot of this spend is performance marketing on Google.  Room nights booked *(in mill):*  |**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |896|591|355|845|  \*What I like about this data is that room nights booked (one night booked = one room night) in 2022 is higher than 2019, which was the record prior to COVID. Room nights have been increasing significantly in geographical areas (like Asia-Pacific) which has lower average daily rates compared to areas like Europe and the U.S. This also impacts their margins.  # Competitors:  Bookings Mix of Room nights for hotels and alternative accommodation:  |||||| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| ||**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**| |Hotels, Motels, Resorts|70%|71%|\--|71%| |Alternative|30%|29%|\--|29%|  **AirBnb:**  The way I am thinking about this is 70% of Bookings accommodations are in hotels and motels and AirBnb mainly generate revenue from homes, holiday houses etc. This is only 30% of Bookings business, which they list as alternative. Although these two companies compete, I don't think it will affect Booking if Airbnb continues to grow since they don't specialise in hotel accommodations. I am curious to know your thoughts about this.  **Website Traffic:**  Expedia: 88.68% website traffic in the U.S.  Airbnb: 71.54% website traffic in the U.S  ***Booking: 10.86% website traffic in the U.S***  Most of Bookings website traffic is concentrated in Europe whereas Expedia and Airbnb is concentrated in the U.S. I believe this has other implications, especially when I compare Booking with Expedia that has a business model that is almost identical. Most of the hotel chains in the U.S are very popular: Marriott, Holiday Inn, Hilton, Hampton Inn and Hyatt to name a few. They have their own loyalty programs and big marketing and merchandising (cheap deals) campaigns and customers often seek these hotels out directly, although they are listed on Expedia as well. Since they are popular, they have bargaining power and can request lower commissions to be listed on an OTA. Since Expedia is heavily concentrated in the United States, this has an impact on their margins. Most of Bookings hotel suppliers are outside of the U.S. and these are often smaller, independent chains that rely more heavily on an OTA.  Expedia operating margins:  |**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |10.2%|3%|\-29.4%|8%|7%|6.6%|  \*I think this explains why Expedia's margins are a lot lower than Booking despite similar business models.  # Industry:  OTA industry estimates suggest it will grow to over $1 trillion at the end of 2030. It is currently at $521 billion. Estimated growth is just over 10%.  # Intrinsic Value Estimate:  Historical data *(in mill)*:  &amp;#x200B;  ||**2023 (estimate)**|**2022**|**2021**|**2020**|**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**2016**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |**FCF**|$7,054|$5,913|$2,243|\-$456|$4,318|$4,882|$4,398|$3,694| |**Percentage Change**|19.3%|163.6%|591%|\-110%|\-11.5%|11%|19%|33.45%| |**ROIC**|53.47%|43%|12.3%|\-3.37%|29.61%|26.67%|23.9%|23.1%|  Growth rates:  &amp;#x200B;  |**Growth Rates**|**1-yr**|**3-yr**|**5-yr**|**7-yr**|**9-yr**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Revenue|25%|47%|8%|11%|12%| |FCF|19%|N/A (COVID)|8%|10%|11%|  I have taken the current year FCF estimate (2023 FY results isn't out yet), and have estimated a growth rate of 8% in yrs 1-5 and 6% in yrs 6-10, discount rate of 10% and terminal value of 20. The growth rates are estimated because of the industry growth projections and Bookings position in the market. Also the 5-year previous growth rates for Booking was 8%, which was the lowest compared to my 1-3-7 and 9 years growth rates so I went with that. 8% is a lower growth rate than the industry growth projections and I wanted to be conservative, especially since the FCF in the current year is at record highs. I always like putting a lower growth rate in the latter half (6%) because it is a lot harder to estimate. The discount rate is high, however, my style has always been to make fewer bets for higher returns and I am happy being patient until those opportunities arrive. This gave me an intrinsic value of $4,296. I try and go a bit further to see if I can get a discount to intrinsic value.

[Meta Q4 Earnings Numbers,;,; Earnings: $5.33 per share. That may not compare with the $4.96 per share expected by LSEG  Revenue: $40.1 billion. That may not compare with the $39.18 billion expected by LSEG   Wall Street will also be looking at these key user numbers:  Daily active users (DAUs): 2.11 billion vs. 2.08 billion expected, according to StreetAccount  Monthly active users (MAUs): 3.07 billion vs. 3.06 billion expected, according to StreetAccount   Meta is projected to report revenue growth of 22% as the online advertising market continues to recover from a brutal 2022, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates forced brands to reel in spending.  CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributes advances in artificial intelligence to improvements in the ad business, which is growing faster than rival Google. In Alphabet‚Äôs earnings report on Tuesday, the company said Google ad revenue increased 11% from a year earlier, slower expansion than analysts were expecting.  Part of Meta‚Äôs financial recovery over the past year was driven by Chinese retailers, which have bolstered spending to reach users across the globe. Meta finance chief Susan Li most recently highlighted the significance of business from China in the company‚Äôs third-quarter earnings report in October. Li didn‚Äôt name specific companies, but fast-growing upstarts Temu and Shein, which originated in China, have been pouring money into ads on Facebook and Instagram.  While Meta has a very diverse base of advertisers, some analysts say the potential for Temu and Shein to pull back spending poses a risk because every point of growth matters for a company that saw revenue shrink for three straight quarters in 2022.  Zuckerberg, along with the top executives at TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Snap and Discord, faced tough questioning from lawmakers on Wednesday. They accused the Facebook founder of ignoring the severity of child exploitation on the company‚Äôs family of apps.  Parents attending the hearing lambasted Meta and other companies for what they allege are insufficient safety and design measures that have caused mental health issues for their children and, in some cases, even resulted in their deaths.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for everything you‚Äôve all gone through. It‚Äôs terrible,‚Äù Zuckerberg told the parents in an emotional scene on Capitol Hill. ‚ÄúNo one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.‚Äù   Investors will also be looking for signs that Meta‚Äôs pivot to the metaverse is bearing fruit. The company has been burning billions of dollars a quarter to build out a virtual world that Zuckerberg has said is the future of computing. In total, the division has lost about $25 billion since the beginning of 2022, shortly after Zuckerberg renamed his company.  Analysts expect Reality Labs to show revenue of $762.8 million for the quarter and an operating loss of $4.26 billion, according to StreetAccount.  Source:  2024-02-01 21:08:48]
[What is the current "META 2022"?,;,; When META tanked, nearly everyone on reddit was predicting its demise, focused almost solely on how stupid the metaverse was. But a few were astute enough to realize that Zuck is no cuck and that everyone else was missing some pretty obvious things, like FB isn't going anywhere anytime soon, like META dominates social media with FB, IG and Whatsapp. Like they are sitting on a shit ton of cash. Anyone truly paying attention knew that the move was to load up on the cheap as the price kept drilling.  So what is today's 2022 Meta? Which stocks are being hated on for no actual good reason?  Edit: Ffs, I can't believe I actually have to put this here. Don't just put a ticker ffs. Explain why you think it's unfairly hated and way way way undervalued. Put up some reasons. geez. Everyone here just pumping their bagholders like SNAP. Seriuosly?,;,; 2024-02-11 15:41:56]
[Meta adds $200 billion to market cap in one day, largest surge in stock market history,;,; Meta shares are up 20% this morning, after the company surpassed analyst expectations and beat earnings. This growth took the company from a market cap near $1 trillion to a market cap of about $1.2 trillion, good for a $200 billion surge, possibly the largest in history.   Meta also announced a $50 billion stock buyback and a new shareholder dividend.    2024-02-02 16:41:09]
[Meta Threads is Missing one important thing Twitter has... PORN!,;,; Meta stock is already up on pre market because of instagram threads.  i think all the changes twitter is having right now like limiting the number of posts you can watch and other changes are really bad and will probably heavily damage the site.  Threads came exactly in the right time when twitter make all those bad changes that will probably cause many users to leave.  The thing that's missing however is all the xxx rated stuff twitter has.  let's not be hypocrite here and be honest.many people watch this type of entertainment -  The Porn Industry is a 97 billion worth industry.

[Meta launches Instagram Threads in a direct challenge to Twitter,;,; Threads is a text-based messaging app that looks very similar to Twitter.  People will be able to use their Instagram usernames on Threads and follow the same accounts on Threads as they do on Meta‚Äôs photo-sharing app.  The release of Threads is noteworthy considering that Twitter has suffered a wave of mishaps under the ownership of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, leaving the popular social messaging app vulnerable to competing apps.   2023-07-06 00:51:39]
[Meta announces Twitter Blue-like paid verification subscription service,;,; Facebook parent Meta is rolling out a paid verification subscription service called ‚ÄòMeta Verified‚Äô for user profiles, co-founder Mark Zuckerberg said on February 19  Zuckerberg said the subscription service will let users verify their account with a government ID to receive a blue badge along with additional impersonation protection against accounts that are claiming to the user and get direct access to customer support.  The subscription service will be available for a fee of $11.99 per month on the web and $14.99 per month on iOS. The higher subscription fee on iOS is likely to offset the 30 percent commission fee levied by Apple on subscriptions.  Meta Verified will be initially rolling out to Australia and New Zealand this week with expansion to more countries shortly.  The social media giant's CEO Mark Zuckerberg has earlier said it was planning to launch several new products that would "empower creators to be way more productive and creative," while cautioning about the cost associated with supporting the technology for a large user base.,;,; 2023-02-19 18:25:31]

[Google is now cheaper than Meta on a forward PE basis,;,; It's probably too soon to call Google a slam dunk value buy here, but what this does show is that the stock decline has been driven largely by investor sentiment and not by Google's business performance. Sentiment could easily get worse, but you're getting plenty of long-term compensation for buying Google at today's prices. Far from being an AI victim, Google looks well positioned for whatever the future of AI may bring, and the lack of positive investor sentiment around this makes it even better to buy. You can buy Google here comfortably, and if the forward PE gets anywhere near where Meta's did, you can ramp up your purchases.  Google is not a recession-proof stock, they're not guaranteed to crush the competition in the AI space, and the company isn't yet as cheap as Meta was during their 2022 debacle. But Google is a great business for a good price.   Above content quoted from: *Google Is The Most-Hated Tech Stock On Wall Street - Time To Buy*,;,; 2023-02-27 19:05:36]

[Is $META going to benefit from Threads?,;,; One of the questions that many META shareholders have is, what is the impact of Threads on the company‚Äôs value?  The answer isn‚Äôt simple, and I‚Äôll try to break down the components and share my thoughts.  Mark Zuckerberg shared that monetization options would be explored once Threads hits one billion users (As am I writing this, there are over 83 million users. For comparison, Twitter has close to 400 million).        From Meta‚Äôs point of view, the so-called family of Apps includes two social media platforms - Facebook and Instagram. Both of these platforms are in mature monetization stages, where both the revenue per user and the margins are incredibly high.        If we take a look at the big picture, all social media companies make money by selling advertisements. The formula behind that is simple:  **Number of users** X **Time spent on the platform** X **Advertisement revenue**  The time that is being spent is limited, every one of us has 24 hours in a day and decides how to use (or waste) it.        Part of the Facebook/Instagram users will use part of their time using Threads and the impact is obvious. If we take a look at the formula above, it is quite clear that the time spent on Facebook/Instagram will be lower, hence, the revenue generated there is expected to decrease. In addition, as Threads is not monetized, it will only bring additional expenses for keeping the platform up and running. In the short run, there shouldn‚Äôt be high expectations for Meta when it comes to the financials.  Whether Threads will generate value, in the long run, depends on a few factors:  \- The # of users that join Threads, from Twitter.  \- The monetization per user of Threads, and how far it will be compared to Facebook/Instagram (So far, Twitter didn‚Äôt use its potential)  \- The outcome of the cease-and-desist letter sent to Meta by Spiro (Elon‚Äôs lawyer) for creating a ‚Äúcopycat‚Äù app.  &amp;#x200B;  Meta's value will increase, only if:        \- The total number of users (Facebook/Instagram/Threads) increases at the expense of Twitter, and;  \- The revenue generated is higher and can cover the additional expenses for running Threads.        I personally, do not think the new platform is creating a lot of value for Meta.,;,; 2023-07-08 17:26:32]
[Meta to Conduct Another Round of Layoffs Affecting Up to 10,000 Jobs, Reports Say,;,; Meta will conduct another mass round of layoffs on Wednesday, several sources working at the company told Vox.  In an internal memo posted to a Meta employee message board on Tuesday evening and viewed by Vox, the company told employees that the layoffs will start on Wednesday and will impact a wide range of technical teams including those working on Facebook, Instagram, Reality Labs, and WhatsApp. A Meta spokesperson confirmed the memo was sent to employees but declined to comment further. The cuts could be in the range of 4,000 jobs, one source said. However, some other sources are claiming the number can go as high as 10,000 causing panic among employees.  Meta employees in North America will be notified by email between 4 am to 5 am PT Wednesday morning, according to Goler‚Äôs note.

[Meta sued by 33 state AGs for addictive features targeting kids,;,;   * A bipartisan group of attorneys general is suing Meta over its addictive features aimed at kids and teens. * The lawsuit represents the broad bipartisan interest in protecting kids and teens from online harm. * Meta designed its Facebook and Instagram products to keep young users on them for longer and repeatedly coming back, the AGs allege.  A bipartisan group of 33 attorneys general is suing Meta  over addictive features aimed at kids and teens, according to a complaint filed Tuesday in a federal court in California. The support from so many state AGs of different political backgrounds indicates a significant legal challenge to Meta‚Äôs business.  The lawsuit represents the latest legal challenge for the company and is another demonstration of the bipartisan priority that state law enforcers have placed on protecting kids and teens from online harm.  It‚Äôs also not the first time a broad coalition of state AGs have teamed up to go after Meta. In 2020, 48 states and territories sued the company on antitrust grounds, alongside a separate complaint from the Federal Trade Commission.  Meta designed its Facebook and Instagram products to keep young users on them for longer and repeatedly coming back, the AGs allege. According to the federal complaint, Meta did this via the design of its algorithms, copious alerts, notifications and so-called infinite scroll through platform feeds. The company also includes features that the AGs allege negatively impact teens‚Äô mental health through social comparison or promoting body dysmorphia, such as ‚Äúlikes‚Äù or photo filters.  The federal suit also accuses Meta of violating the Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting personal data on users under 13 without parental consent.  The states are seeking an end to what they see as Meta‚Äôs harmful practices, as well as penalties and restitution.  Meta was well aware of the negative effects its design could have on its young users, the AGs allege.  Former Facebook employee Frances Haugen caused an uproar among lawmakers and parents in 2021 after leaking internal documents from the company that revealed internal research on its products. One set of documents about Instagram‚Äôs impact on teens found that ‚Äúthirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse,‚Äù The Wall Street Journal reported before Haugen made her identity known. Following the report, Instagram said it was working on ways to pull users away from dwelling on negative topics.  Several of the practices the AGs focus on for Meta are similar to those exercised by other social media businesses, such as designing algorithms to keep users engaged.  Among the states that filed the suit are California, Colorado, Louisiana, Nebraska, New York, South Carolina, Washington and Wisconsin.,;,; 2023-10-24 15:47:38]
[Meta Is Said to Plan Thousands More Layoffs as Soon as This Week,;,; Meta Is Said to Plan Thousands More Layoffs as Soon as This Week  -Second round of cuts in four months driven by efficiency push  -Social networking giant may finalize plans in the next week  Meta Platforms Inc., the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is planning a fresh round of layoffs and will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.  The world‚Äôs largest social networking company is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13% reduction in November, in a bid to become a more efficient organization. In its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff. The company has also been working to flatten its organization, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, Bloomberg News reported in February, a move that is still being finalized and could affect thousands of staffers.  The imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the ‚Äúflattening,‚Äù said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.  This phase of layoffs could be finalized in the next week, according to the people. **Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.**  The November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta‚Äôs ‚Äúyear of efficiency,‚Äù and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.  Workers at the Menlo Park, California-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they‚Äôd receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the people said.   2023-03-07 02:42:03]
[Mark Zuckerberg Says Meta Will Own Billions Worth of Nvidia H100 GPUs by Year End,;,;   On Instagram Thursday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company will have 350,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units and overall almost 600,000 H100 compute equivalent GPUs by the end of this year.  ‚ÄúOur long term vision is to build general intelligence, open source it responsibly, and make it widely available so everyone can benefit,‚Äù he wrote in the post. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre building massive compute infrastructure to support our future roadmap‚Äù for artificial intelligence. Zuckerberg also said he excited about Meta‚Äôs progress incorporating AI technology in other type of devices like its Ray Ban smart glasses.  Start-ups and enterprise have clamored for Nvidia ‚Äôs GPUs, or graphics processing units because they are well suited for the parallel computations needed for AI projects.  A Meta spokesperson declined to provide clarity on the timing of H100 purchases and on whether the other H100 equivalent GPUs consisted of other Nvidia GPU models or were from different third parties.  Nvidia declined to comment on the timing of Meta‚Äôs H100 purchases.  The H100 is Nvidia‚Äôs current top-of-line data center GPU and costs roughly $25,000 per GPU, according to a slide in an earlier company presentation that showed a 16 H100 GPU system costs $400,000.  Though, it is unknown at what price Meta can purchase the H100, a quantity of 350,000 at $25,000 per GPU comes to nearly $9 billion.  Link to video    2024-01-19 00:55:05]

[Meta, Microsoft and Amazon team up on maps project to crack Apple-Google duopoly,;,;   Google and Apple dominate the market for online maps, charging mobile app developers for access to their mapping services. The other mega-cap tech companies are joining together to help create another option. A group formed by Meta, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, along with TomTom, is releasing data that could enable companies to build their own maps, without having to rely on Google or Apple. The Overture Maps Foundation, which was established late last year, captured 59 million ‚Äúpoints of interest,‚Äù such as restaurants, landmarks, streets and regional borders. The data has been cleaned and formatted so it can be used for free as the base layer for a new map application.  Meta and Microsoft collected and donated the data to Overture, according to Marc Prioleau, executive director of the OMF. Data on places is often difficult to collect and license, and building map data requires lots of time and staff to gather and clean it, he told CNBC in an interview. ‚ÄúWe have some companies that, if they wanted to invest to build the map data, they could,‚Äù Prioleau said. Rather than spending that kind of money, he said, companies were asking, ‚ÄúCan we just get collaboration around the open base map?‚Äù Overture is aiming to establish a baseline for maps data so that companies can use it to build and operate their own maps.  For many companies, Google‚Äôs and Apple‚Äôs maps aren‚Äôt ideal, because they don‚Äôt provide access to the underlying data. Instead, those companies allow app makers to use their maps as a service and, in many cases, charge each time the underlying map is accessed. For example, app makers pay per thousand Google Maps lookups through an application programming interface (API). Apple allows access to Apple Maps for free for native app developers, but web app developers need to pay. ‚ÄúThat works for a lot of people, but not for others,‚Äù Prioleau said. Overture is only offering the underlying map data, leaving it up to companies to build their own software on top of it.,;,; 2023-07-26 17:13:04]

[Meta ordered to suspend Facebook EU data flows as it‚Äôs hit with record ‚Ç¨1.2BN privacy fine under GDPR,;,; It‚Äôs finally happened: Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has been hit with a formal suspension order requiring it to stop exporting European Union user data to the US for processing.  Today the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) announced that Meta has been fined ‚Ç¨1.2 billion (close to $1.3BN) ‚Äî which the Board confirmed is the largest fine ever issued under the bloc‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). (The prior record goes to Amazon which was stung for $887M for misusing customers data for ad targeting back in 2021.)  Meta‚Äôs sanction is for breaching conditions set out in the pan-EU regulation governing transfers of personal data to so-called third countries (in this case the US) without ensuring adequate protections for people‚Äôs information.   European judges have previously found US surveillance practices conflict with EU privacy rights.  In a press release announcing today‚Äôs decision the EDPB‚Äôs chair, Andrea Jelinek, said:  &gt; The EDPB found that Meta IE‚Äôs [Ireland‚Äôs] infringement is very serious since it concerns transfers that are systematic, repetitive and continuous.

TikTok has impeding ban US-wide and possibly Europe 2. VR is growing and they are heavily vested in it, at the moment almost monopoly 3. It is still printing money despite massive VR investment 4. Instagram is very much alive   Negatives  1. Apple VR intro imminent next week, could crater Meta depending on what Apple reveals 2. Facebook is essentially a dead platform among zoomers and younger 3.

[Meta‚Äôs Reality Labs has now lost more than $21 billion since the beginning of last year,;,; * Meta‚Äôs Reality Labs unit, which develops virtual reality and augmented reality technologies, logged a $3.7 billion operating loss on $276 million in sales during the second quarter. * In June, Meta announced a VR subscription service dubbed Meta Quest+, which costs $7.99 a month. * Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently revealed pricing details about the Quest 3 headset just days before Apple announced its Vision Pro VR and AR headset.  Meta reported second-quarter earnings on Wednesday and said that its Reality Labs unit, which develops virtual reality and augmented reality technologies needed to power the metaverse, logged a $3.7 billion operating loss.  The unit recorded $276 million in second-quarter sales, down from the $339 million in revenue it brought during the first quarter. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were projecting Reality Labs to record $421 million in sales and $3.5 billion in operating losses.  Shares of Meta were up about 5% after it reported an 11% pop in revenue as advertising rebounded and the company issued an uplifting sales forecast for the third quarter. It shows that Meta is still very much an ad company with a big cost center.  Last year, Meta‚Äôs Reality Labs unit lost a total of $13.7 billion while bringing in $2.16 billion in revenue, which is driven in part by the company‚Äôs sales of Quest-branded VR headsets. Reality Labs lost $3.99 billion during the first quarter. That puts its total losses at about $21.3 billion since the beginning of last year.  Meta said in its earnings report that it expects operating losses in its Reality Labs unit ‚Äúto increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in augmented reality/virtual reality and investments to further scale our ecosystem.‚Äù   2023-07-27 14:15:17]
[if you sold META below $100 last November, stock-picking is not for you,;,; Studies show that most people who try to buy and sell individual stocks end up underperforming the market. But it can take years to acknowledge that you yourself are one of those people.  Luckily, a quick and easy test has presented itself. If you sold META below $100 last November, you *definitely* shouldn't be trying to buy and sell individual stocks.  The volume chart shows huge quantities of shares traded hands down there below $100. If you are one of the people who sold, you're not good at this. You have lousy skills and bad instincts. You will cost yourself massive amounts of money if you continue to try to buy and sell individual stocks.  META was clearly undervalued when it bottomed last November. Anyone who sold was completely misunderstanding the company's prospects, or was panicking based on recent price action, or both... indicating someone who does not have what it takes to successfully buy and sell individual stocks.  Almost all of us should probably avoid individual stock-picking and just stick to the S&amp;P 500. But there are some who *definitely* should avoid it... and if you sold META below $100 last November, you're one of them.,;,; 2023-06-01 16:02:51]
[Meta Up 9% Premarket After Strong Earnings Reported with ‚ÄúMonster‚Äù Guidance,;,; [  Meta Platforms impressively exceeded expectations in Q2 2023, reporting strong earnings and revenue driven by the success of its AI-powered ad campaign. The company's stock surged 9% in premarket trading, reaching $325.53 ahead of Thursday's market opening. A robust rebound in the digital ad market and advertisers' growing confidence in Meta's AI capabilities contributed to its remarkable quarterly performance.  Looking ahead, Meta issued an optimistic revenue forecast for Q3 2023, anticipating revenues between $32 billion and $34.5 billion. Bernstein analysts described this guidance as a "monster guidance," implying a potential year-over-year growth of at least 15%. Additionally, Meta's short-form video offering, Reels, achieved an impressive annual revenue run rate of over $10 billion in the latest quarter, demonstrating the platform's continued expansion and monetization.  Despite facing losses in its virtual world business division, Meta remains committed to its metaverse vision. CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated the company's dedication to investing in AI and advancing the metaverse concept, considering the two areas as overlapping and complementary. With the recent launch of Threads, a direct competitor to Twitter, which attracted over 10 million users within hours, Meta continues to showcase its adaptability and drive for innovation in the tech industry.,;,; 2023-07-27 11:58:11]

[Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..),;,; From     The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the "magnificent seven" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.  The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.  The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to "address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights."  The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.  The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.   How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted? The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.  The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.  The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.  Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.  Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.  Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.  Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.  Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.  How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut? Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.  Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.  The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.  Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023 The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.  This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.  There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.  Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices? The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.  However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&amp;P 500, which is why S&amp;P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.  The S&amp;P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.  Most of the "magnificent 7" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.  The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.  Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.,;,; 2023-07-10 20:25:37]
[Meta plans to cut thousands of jobs, after CEO predicted no more layoffs,;,;   Facebook parent company Meta is preparing for a fresh round of job cuts, deputizing human resources, lawyers, financial experts and top executives to draw up plans to deflate the company‚Äôs hierarchy, in a reorganization and downsizing effort that could affect thousands of workers.  Meta plans to push some leaders into lower-level roles without direct reports, flattening the layers of management between Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the company‚Äôs interns, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on about internal matters. Other managers may end up overseeing a higher number of employees as their teams grow bigger. Some inside Meta expect employees whose jobs have been converted to eventually quit, trimming the company‚Äôs workforce by default. In addition to targeting managers, the company is also considering more traditional cuts, including slashing some projects and jobs, the person said. These efforts, which are targeted at divisions across the company and around the world, may not happen on a single day, but will likely roll out across the company in the coming months.  The job eliminations arrive after Zuckerberg sought to reassure workers that he didn‚Äôt ‚Äúanticipate more layoffs‚Äù after the company slashed 11,000 jobs ‚Äî roughly 13 percent of its workforce ‚Äî in November. At the time, Zuckerberg told remaining employees the company had made a substantial cut to ‚Äúminimize the chance of having to do broad layoffs like this for the foreseeable future,‚Äù according to a recording of the companywide meeting reviewed by The Washington Post.  ‚ÄúI obviously can‚Äôt sit here and promise you that nothing will happen in the future because it‚Äôs a very volatile environment,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúBut what I can say is that for where we are right now, that‚Äôs was I foresee.‚Äù  But earlier this month, Zuckerberg proclaimed 2023 the ‚Äúyear of efficiency,‚Äù promising investors he would trim middle management and speed up the company‚Äôs decision-making, hinting at the possibility of more cuts.  Meta spokesman Dave Arnold declined to comment but directed The Washington Post to previous public comments from Zuckerberg in which he said the company needed to become more efficient.  ‚ÄúWe closed last year with some difficult layoffs and restructuring some teams,‚Äù Zuckerberg told investors earlier this month. ‚ÄúWhen we did this, I said clearly that this was the beginning of our focus on efficiency and not the end.‚Äù,;,; 2023-02-22 16:56:45]
[Why I bought and sold Meta,;,; Back in November 2022, I wrote my analysis and valuation of Meta:  [  It was written, by coincidence, on the day when the share price hit the lowest point before recovering.  &amp;#x200B;  This post serves to archive my thoughts on my investment decisions:  **Why I bought Meta:**  When I looked at the company, I saw Meta as a speculative bet. Although the family of apps (Instagram/Facebook/WhatsApp) are cash-generating machines, putting tens of billions into the Metaverse brought a lot of uncertainty. There wasn't (and still isn't) a lot of info to make an educated guess on how much that segment is or will be worth. So in my valuation, I focused on what I knew.  Based on my analysis, the market was applying roughly a $100b discount due to the Metaverse, compared to a scenario where no investments into that were made.  Mark Zuckerberg has roughly 60% of the voting rights due to the dual-class shares. This means he has significant influence over the decisions being made. Therefore, if he wants to be the first to create something, he can move towards that, regardless if that's the best outcome for the shareholders.  This brought the share price down from the high of $350+ (which I believe was overvalued) to below $100, representing a decrease of 75%. The market was expecting Zuckerberg to be stubborn and continue executing his vision.  Personally, I am interested in increasing my knowledge over time, and as mentioned in the initial post, I decided to open a position to be entertained by what is coming next.  &amp;#x200B;  **Why I sold Meta:**  After the collapse of the share price, the management of Meta did a lot of changes. The metaverse wasn't the main focus, the # of employees was reduced and the focus went to improving operating efficiency.   The market liked this, a lot, and since, the share price is up 160%+  Now, with the share price being close to $240 and a market cap of $614b, based on my analysis, Meta is overvalued, again. I don't see a significant upside, hence, I did close my position.  &amp;#x200B;  My main takeaway from all of this is, despite the voting rights being in the hands of one individual when there's a lot of pressure from the outside world, it is difficult to go against everyone. Especially after the share price decreases by 75%.   I am sure that there will be future cases when the management will go with their heads against the wall, but Meta was not one of them.,;,; 2023-05-02 20:21:09]
[Is it too late to invest in Meta? How do people gage when it's too late?,;,; I'm looking into a few different companies to invest in.

[let's be real. if a megacap stock drops 50%, 99% of y'all wouldn't touch it,;,; It's intriguing how recent market trends, like META's dramatic drop and subsequent recovery, reflect investor psychology more than rational analysis. Earlier this year, META was trading at a 75% discount from its all-time high, and the general sentiment was overwhelmingly negative, akin to buying Blockbuster stock in 2006.  However, following its near 300% rise from that low point, perceptions have shifted drastically. This flip-flop in attitude underlines a critical aspect of investing: market sentiment is often driven by emotion rather than fundamentals. If META, or any big name for that matter, dropped by 50% again, history suggests that the majority of investors would shy away, not jump in.  This pattern is a classic example of the behavioral economics at play in the stock market, where fear and greed often override logical decision-making. It's why individual stock picking, especially based on market dips, can be so risky and unpredictable. It demonstrates the value of a more diversified, steady approach, like investing in index funds, which is likely a more suitable strategy for the majority of investors.,;,; 2023-11-30 23:41:33]
[Facebook wants to charge EU users $14 a month if they don't agree to personalized ads on Facebook and Instagram,;,; Meta is considering introducing subscription-based, ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The move aims to comply with the EU's new ad privacy regulations. The subscription fee would start at around ‚Ç¨10 ($10.50) for desktop users and rise to about $14 for mobile users, accounting for commissions charged by Apple and Google's app stores. The subscription model is still under review for compliance with EU laws. This comes after Meta faced a $1.3 billion fine from European regulators for data privacy violations.  **Regulatory Arbitrage**: Meta's decision can be viewed as a form of regulatory arbitrage, aimed at circumventing the stringent data privacy laws enforced by the European Union. Given the EU's propensity for imposing substantial fines, this move could serve as a risk mitigation strategy, thereby stabilizing the company's regulatory profile.  **Revenue Diversification and Financial Stability**: The introduction of a subscription-based revenue model is a strategic pivot away from the increasingly volatile ad-based revenue streams. This diversification could serve to stabilize Meta's cash flows, thereby making it a more attractive and less risky investment in the long term.  **Market Test for Global Scalability**: The European market will act as a bellwether for the viability of this new revenue model. A successful implementation in Europe could pave the way for a global rollout, offering a significant upside potential for revenue growth and stock appreciation.  **Industry Precedence and Competitive Moats**: By being the first to introduce a subscription-based model in the social media landscape, Meta has the opportunity to build a competitive moat. This first-mover advantage could deter competitors from entering the space, thereby consolidating Meta's market share and potentially driving up its valuation.  **User Adoption as a Leading Indicator**: The rate of user adoption will serve as a leading indicator for the success of this initiative. High adoption rates could signify a paradigm shift in consumer preferences, moving away from ad-supported to subscription-based models. This could have a ripple effect on Meta's long-term revenue and profitability metrics.  Article from [Business Insider]( 2023-10-03 15:16:49]

[Negative impact of generative AI on social media stocks like meta?,;,;  I‚Äôm curious about your opinions on how generative AI will affect social media companies in the future.

In the near future, we may have entire fake influencers posting images and videos of themselves doing things when they don't even exist.

[Powerhouse Picks: META, AMZN, or NFLX - Unveiling the most compelling FAANG stock,;,;    # Meta Platforms ($META)  Shares of social media giant Meta Platforms have rallied by a phenomenal 107% year-to-date. The company impressed investors by returning back to revenue growth in the first quarter (after three straight quarters of decline) despite subdued digital ad spending due to macro pressures.  Investors have also cheered the company‚Äôs aggressive cost-cutting and streamlining efforts, including thousands of layoffs. Despite the distraction caused by regulatory matters, most Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about Meta‚Äôs prospects.  Meta‚Äôs user base continues to expand, with daily active people (number of users who visited at least one of the family apps ‚ÄìFacebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp in a day) growing 5% year-over-year to 3.02 billion (on average) in March. The company expects capital expenditure of $30 billion to $33 billion this year toward the build-out of its artificial intelligence (AI) capacity to support ads, Feed, and Reels as well as increased investment in generative AI initiatives.  **Is Meta a Good Stock to Buy?**  On Tuesday, Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion reiterated a Buy rating on Meta Platforms stock with a price target of $270 after taking a deep look at the company‚Äôs AI capabilities.The analyst sees the company leveraging AI to boost user engagement, develop better and more automated advertiser tools, and create an open-source AI ecosystem. Champion is also optimistic about Meta‚Äôs positioning within the digital ads space.  ## Amazon ($AMZN)  Like Meta, Amazon is also reducing its costs to navigate a tough business backdrop. The company‚Äôs retail business has been under pressure due to the impact of macro challenges on consumer spending. Additionally, the slowdown in the growth rate of the higher-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has also been concerning. Enterprises are moderating their IT budgets, which is weighing on AWS‚Äôs growth.  Wall Street continues to be bullish on Amazon and sees solid potential in the retail and AWS divisions over the long term. Moreover, AMZN‚Äôs rapidly growing advertising business is also expected to boost revenue in the years ahead. Despite macro pressures, Amazon‚Äôs ad revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $9.5 billion in Q1.  **Is AMZN a Buy, Sell, or Hold?**  Earlier this week, Mizuho analyst James Lee increased his price target for Amazon to $160 from $145 and reiterated a Buy rating, calling the stock his top pick for the second half of 2023. The analyst expects multiple expansion as concerns about the company‚Äôs AI market position ‚Äúdiminish.‚Äù  Recent channel checks by Lee‚Äôs firm with a leading channel partner indicated that AWS‚Äôs generative AI demand has been accelerating due to the ease of transition and product differentiation.  ‚ÄúCase studies show that AWS wins over clients on intelligence privacy and data security,‚Äù said Lee. Further, he also highlighted that generative AI is priced meaningfully higher than conventional computing, so it is expected to be both revenue and margin accretive to AWS. Consequently, Lee believes AWS revenue growth will likely trough in Q2 before rebounding in the second half of the year.  ## Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)  Netflix‚Äôs crackdown on password sharing has improved investor sentiment about the streaming giant. Password sharing has been a key concern for Netflix, especially as competition has become intense in the streaming space. Netflix had previously estimated that over 100 million households share accounts, representing 43% of its global user base. This week, Netflix rolled out its password-sharing crackdown to its home market.  Aside from the password-sharing crackdown, Netflix‚Äôs business is expected to improve through its recent introduction of a cheaper, ad-supported tier.  **What is the Price Target for Netflix?**  On Thursday, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein increased the price target for Netflix stock to $450 from $415 and maintained a Buy rating in reaction to the launch of paid sharing offering at $7.99 per additional household stream.  Prior to the announcement, the analyst‚Äôs firm conducted a survey of 1,800 U.S. Netflix consumers. The survey indicated a healthy propensity to pay for ‚Äúremote‚Äù users, with certain abandoned users willing to pay for their own subscriptions.  While 45% of respondents indicated a willingness to pay for ‚Äúremote‚Äù users, 70% indicated an inclination for the $6.99 ad-tier plan. With pricing of the paid sharing option above the ad-tier, the survey suggests a significant portion of these users will be pushed toward the ad-based offer.  # Conclusion  Wall Street is more bullish on Meta Platforms and Amazon compared to Netflix. Given the massive rally in Meta stock, Wall Street sees higher upside potential in Amazon stock from current levels. Analysts mainly see solid potential in Amazon‚Äôs AWS cloud business, supported by solid demand for cloud computing and prospects for growth in the AI space.,;,; 2023-05-29 11:19:17]

[Apple Unveils Vision Pro AR/VR Headset, Its First Major New Product In Nearly A Decade,;,; On Monday, Apple unveiled its much-anticipated mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro, the tech giant‚Äôs first major new product category since 2015‚Äôs Apple Watch.  The new device, packed with cameras and sensors, looks like a futuristic pair of ski goggles, and can immerse a wearer in virtual reality but also blend in the real-world elements of augmented reality. CEO Tim Cook announced the new product at the company‚Äôs Worldwide Developers Conference held at its sparkling Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino, CA.  Apple‚Äôs virtual reality plans date back roughly a decade, and Cook has been teasing his ambitions publicly for the better part of that time. As far back as 2016, the company filed patents for lightweight eyeglasses and a bulkier device. But while Cook reportedly preferred the more compact option, according to reports by Bloomberg, the technical challenge forced Apple to change its strategy.  The device announcement comes years after other Silicon Valley juggernauts including Meta and Google parent Alphabet have tried to bring high-tech headsets into the mainstream. Facebook in 2014 bought the startup Oculus for $2 billion and has released two generations of its Meta Quest, geared mostly toward gamers. Microsoft in 2016 made a big bet on its Hololens headset, a 3D augmented reality device, but has failed to gain traction with consumers. Google made the buzziest splash more than a decade ago with its disastrous Google Glass, a sleek headset with a camera on board. The product drew immediate outrage, with early adopters dubbed ‚Äúglassholes.‚Äù  Apple has rarely been first to new product categories, instead letting other companies take the lead while it developed products it hoped could dominate over rivals. Apple was beat to market in mp3 players, smartphones, tablets and smartwatches, but its iPods, iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches have all become category-defining devices.  Apple will have a bigger challenge ahead as it asks people to put its latest product directly on their faces for everyday use‚Äîan aim which has eluded all its well-capitalized predecessors. Today‚Äôs headsets often lead to people complaining about the devices overheating, being too heavy to wear for too long or leaving sweaty foreheads. Others have found the experience of being disconnected to the real world‚Äîimmersed in full-on virtual reality for long periods of time‚Äîtoo isolating. Cook said in an interview with GQ earlier this year that Apple‚Äôs device could increase collaboration, though Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs vision to achieve a similar effect in the workplace has failed to take off.   2023-06-05 18:29:40]
[Meta‚Äôs AR/VR roadmap for the next four years: three new Quest headsets, AR glasses in 2027, and a ‚Äòneural interface‚Äô smartwatch,;,; This is Meta‚Äôs AR/VR hardware roadmap for the next four years  During an internal presentation, Meta execs laid out plans for three new Quest headsets, AR glasses in 2027, and a ‚Äòneural interface‚Äô smartwatch.  Meta plans to release its first pair of smart glasses with a display in 2025 alongside a neural interface smartwatch designed to control them, The Verge has learned. Meanwhile, its first pair of full-fledged AR glasses, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg has predicted will eventually be as widely used as mobile phones, is planned for 2027.  The details were shared with thousands of employees in Meta‚Äôs Reality Labs division on Tuesday during a roadmap presentation of its AR and VR efforts that was shared with The Verge. Altogether, they show how Meta is planning to keep investing in consumer hardware after a series of setbacks and broader cost cutting across the company. A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment for this story.  With regards to the VR roadmap, employees were told that Meta‚Äôs flagship Quest 3 headset coming later this year will be two times thinner, at least twice as powerful, and cost slightly more than the $400 Quest 2. Like the recently announced Quest Pro, it will prominently feature mixed reality experiences that don‚Äôt fully immerse the wearer, thanks to front-facing cameras that pass through video of the real world. Meta has sold nearly 20 million Quest headsets to date, Mark Rabkin, the company‚Äôs vice president for VR, told employees during the presentation.  (I‚Äôll have more from this meeting and my thoughts about Meta‚Äôs roadmap in Thursday‚Äôs issue of my newsletter Command Line.)  Three new Quest models   Meta‚Äôs main challenge with the Quest 3, which is internally codenamed Stinson, will be convincing people to pay ‚Äúa bit more‚Äù money than the cost of the existing Quest 2, according to Rabkin. ‚ÄúWe have to get enthusiasts fired up about it,‚Äù he told employees Tuesday. ‚ÄúWe have to prove to people that all this power, all these new features are worth it.‚Äù  Meta has sold nearly 20 million Quest headsets to date  Mixed reality will be a huge selling point, and Rabkin said there will be a new ‚Äúsmart guardian‚Äù to help wearers navigate the real world while they are wearing the device. ‚ÄúThe main north star for the team was from the moment you put on this headset, the mixed reality has to make it feel better, easier, more natural,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou can walk effortlessly through your house knowing you can see perfectly well. You can put anchors and things on your desktop. You can take your coffee. You can stay in there much longer.‚Äù  There will be 41 new apps and games shipping for the Quest 3, including new mixed reality experiences to take advantage of the updated hardware, Rabkin said. In 2024, he said that Meta plans to ship a more ‚Äúaccessible‚Äù headset codenamed Ventura. ‚ÄúThe goal for this headset is very simple: pack the biggest punch we can at the most attractive price point in the VR consumer market.‚Äù  Rabkin didn‚Äôt say whether a second generation of the recent Meta Quest Pro, which received poor reviews from The Verge and others, is coming anytime soon. The closest to what sounds like a successor will be ‚Äúway out in the future‚Äù after Ventura in 2024, when Meta is planning its most advanced headset codenamed La Jolla featuring photorealistic, codec avatars.  ‚ÄúWe want to make it higher resolution for work use and really nail work, text and things like that,‚Äù Rabkin said about La Jolla. ‚ÄúWe want to take a lot of the comfort things from Quest Pro and how it sits on your head and the split architecture and bring that in for comfort.‚Äù  Meanwhile, he acknowledged that the current Quest is struggling to keep new users engaged. ‚ÄúRight now, we‚Äôre on our third year of Quest 2,‚Äù he told employees. ‚ÄúAnd sadly, the newer cohorts that are coming in, the people who bought it this last Christmas, they‚Äôre just not as into it‚Äù or engaged as ‚Äúthe ones who bought it early.‚Äù  Rabkin pushed employees to make the sharing of VR content on other platforms ‚Äútrivial,‚Äù redesign the Quest store to make it more ‚Äúdynamic,‚Äù and give developers the ability to do things like automated promotions.  The current Quest is struggling to keep new users engaged  ‚ÄúWe need to be better at growth and retention and resurrection,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need to be better at social and actually make those things more reliable, more intuitive so people can count on it.‚Äù   Even with these struggles, Meta has built an early lead in virtual reality hardware. But its big swings over the coming years speak to the serious competition that‚Äôs about to arrive. Apple is expected to announce a high-end virtual reality headset sometime this year, while Sony just released the well-received PSVR 2 for console gamers. Meanwhile, Apple, Google, Snap, and others are all racing toward something even bigger: augmented reality glasses ‚Äî and that‚Äôs where Meta is hoping its early efforts in the mixed reality space will really pay off.  AR glasses and neural interfaces   A demo from late 2021 illustrates how Meta imagines AR glasses could work to let someone play chess with a hologram. A demo from late 2021 illustrates how Meta imagines AR glasses could work to let someone play chess with a hologram. Image: Metanone  Aside from the Quest lineup, Meta also has thousands of employees building future AR glasses and wrist devices for controlling them. The key difference from VR is that the company intends for AR glasses to eventually be worn throughout the day as a replacement for smartphones. Zuckerberg has called them the ‚Äúholy grail‚Äù device that will ‚Äúredefine our relationship with technology‚Äù by the end of this decade.  During Tuesday‚Äôs roadmap presentation, Alex Himel, the company‚Äôs vice president for AR, laid out the plan for a bevy of devices through 2027. The first launch will come this fall with the second generation of Meta‚Äôs camera-equipped smart glasses it released in 2021 with Luxottica, the parent company of Ray-Ban.  In 2025, Himel said the third generation of the smart glasses will ship with a display that he called a ‚Äúviewfinder‚Äù for viewing incoming text messages, scanning QR codes, and translating text from another language in real time. The glasses will come with a ‚Äúneural interface‚Äù band that allows the wearer to control the glasses through hand movements, such as swiping fingers on an imaginary D-pad.  Eventually, he said the band will let the wearer use a virtual keyboard and type at the same words per minute as what mobile phones allow.  The smartwatch will integrate with Meta‚Äôs social media apps and offer health and fitness features  While Meta canned its plans for a smartwatch with a detachable display and cameras, it‚Äôs still working on another smartwatch to accompany its 2025 glasses, Himel confirmed.  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want people to have to choose between an input device on their wrist and smartwatch functionality that they‚Äôve come to love,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo we are building a neural interfaces watch. Number one, this device will do input: input to control your glasses, input to control the functionality on your wrist, and input to control the world around you.‚Äù  Himel showed employees a demo of the glasses in which, during a video call, the cameras on the glasses were showing the wearer‚Äôs front-facing perspective at the same time as a selfie view was being shown from the camera on the watch. He said the smartwatch will be an optional upgrade from a paired-down neural band that comes with the glasses, and that it will also integrate with Meta‚Äôs social media apps like WhatsApp and offer health and fitness features.  Meta‚Äôs Ray-Ban Stories, released in 2021, have two cameras for capturing photos and videos. Meta‚Äôs Ray-Ban Stories, released in 2021, have two cameras for capturing photos and videos. Photo by Amanda Lopez for The Vergenone  Meta‚Äôs first true pair of AR glasses, which the company has been internally developing for 8 years under the codename Orion, are more technically advanced, expensive, and designed to project high-quality holograms of avatars onto the real world. There will be an ‚Äúinternal launch‚Äù for employees to test the glasses in 2024, according to Himel. A version won‚Äôt be released to the public until 2027, when Meta will launch what Himel called its ‚ÄúInnovation‚Äù line of AR glasses for early adopters alongside a ‚ÄúScale‚Äù line of the less advanced smart glasses and the second generation of its neural smartwatch.  Himel framed the market opportunity around the almost two billion pairs of regular glasses and hundreds of millions of smartwatches that are sold each year. ‚ÄúIf we can put on shelves a great product at a great price with the right value, we believe we can get into these upgrade cycles and have a lot of growth of our devices,‚Äù he told the room. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on us to deliver.‚Äù   ‚ÄúA business unlike anything we‚Äôve seen on mobile phones before‚Äù  Meta is planning to rely on its existing business model of advertising to help it make money off these future devices. Himel said the company thinks it can make a higher average revenue per user than what it makes currently in social media, thanks to a combination of selling virtual goods, optional add-ons like cloud backups, and AR ads.  ‚ÄúWe should be able to run a very good ads business,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs easy to imagine how ads would show up in space when you have AR glasses on. Our ability to track conversions, which is where there has been a lot of focus as a company, should also be close to 100 percent.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre hitting anything near projections, it will be a tremendous business,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA business unlike anything we‚Äôve seen on mobile phones before.‚Äù,;,; 2023-03-01 16:10:46]

However, I managed to hold my NVDA, which was up so much, but eventually, I sold it at $425 in August.

["Magnificent 7" vs S&amp;P 500?,;,; I really don't like the *"Magnificent 7"* name at all, but since everyone has adopted it, let's just roll with it. For those who don't know the Magnificent 7 are: **AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META, TSLA, NVDA.** With a combined market cap of **more than $11 trillion**, they currently make up approx. **29% of the S&amp;P 500's market cap.**   The 7 giants have gained **71%** so far this year while the rest of the 493 stocks included in the benchmark index have gained 6%. They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets.   Most analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least.   Now I know this is a "stocks" subreddit but just like the majority of retail investors, a large chunk of my portfolio is alocated to an S&amp;P 500 ETF.  So I am actually considering instead of DCAing into a broad index ETF, why don't I just DCA into those 7? Maybe even swap META &amp; TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE.  Should we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world? Should we consider cyclicality? There's no doubt that all 7 of these companies are leaders and are probably not going anywhere in the near future. Nowdays it's as difficult as ever to overtake these giants, imo.,;,; 2023-11-16 10:38:24]

[American Companies Plan on Becoming Employers‚Äô Landlords by Building Company Towns,;,;   Article body:  The housing crisis in the United States has prompted some major companies to consider building company towns. Instead of relying on traditional rental properties, companies such as Google, Tesla, and Meta are exploring the idea of becoming landlords themselves, building company towns, and purchasing large pieces of land to provide housing for their workers.  In the early 20th century, company towns were a common sight, designed to provide housing, schools, stores, and a sense of community for workers. Fast forward to the present day, and Silicon Valley giants are revisiting this concept, exploring the creation of self-contained communities for their workforce. While the concept of company towns is not new, this modern approach involves providing a range of amenities and services within the community, such as parks, restaurants, and shops, to create a sense of community and improve the work-life balance of employees.  Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is planning to build an entire town near Austin, Texas, where three of his companies, Boring, Tesla, and SpaceX, have operations. The new company town is intended to offer below-market rents to his employees, providing an attractive solution to the housing challenges faced by many workers. Similarly, Meta, the parent company of Facebook, is also considering the construction of a company town to provide housing for its employees. Google is already in the process of building a 153-acre neighborhood near its headquarters in Mountain View, California, which will include over 7,000 residential units and 26 acres of public parks and open space.  While the idea of corporate-built company towns addresses the pressing issue of housing shortages, it has also sparked concerns about employee flexibility. With health insurance already tied to employment, intertwining housing with work could further limit an individual‚Äôs freedom to change jobs or locations. Critics argue that this deliberate entanglement is an attempt by companies to exert greater control over their workforce.  In response to these developments, legislation has been introduced to address the growing need for affordable housing. The proposed Workforce Housing Tax Credit Act seeks to provide states and developers with a new source of funding for the production of affordable rental housing. The Workforce Housing Tax Credit (WHTC) Act aims to incentivize the creation of housing for middle-income families. However, skeptics question the true intentions behind the legislation, speculating that it may serve as a tool for companies to claim tax credits while gaining additional influence over their employees.  The trend of companies building towns for their employees is not confined to the United States. Globally, mega-projects like NEOM are emerging as examples where entire towns are being constructed to accommodate workers. This global phenomenon highlights the evolving nature of the employer-employee relationship and the growing influence of corporations in shaping the living environments of their workforce.,;,; 2024-01-16 12:19:54]

[Samsung‚Äôs profit plunged 95% to its lowest level since 2009 as chip demand slumps,;,; &gt;South Korean electronics giant Samsung‚Äôs operating profit plunged in the first quarter as prices for its memory chips continued to fall and demand remained weak.   &gt;   &gt;Here are Samsung‚Äôs earnings at a glance in the first quarter:¬†   &gt;   &gt;**Revenue:** 63.75 trillion Korean won (about $47.6 billion), down 18% year-on-year. That is on par with [Samsung‚Äôs own guidance of approximately 63 trillion Korean won]( but below the 63.9 trillion won expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates.   &gt;   &gt;**Operating profit:** 640 billion Korean won (roughly $478.55 million), down from 14.12 trillion won a year earlier. The company [issued guidance earlier this month]( saying Q1 profit would be 600 billion Korean won.   &gt;   &gt;This is the company‚Äôs lowest operating profit since the first quarter of 2009.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;**Samsung sees memory recovery ahead**   &gt;   &gt;Traditionally, Samsung‚Äôs biggest profit driver is its semiconductor division which consists of sales of memory chips that go into everything from personal computers to smartphones to servers in data centers.   &gt;   &gt;Samsung posted a 4.58 trillion Korean won loss at its semiconductor business versus a 8.45 trillion won profit in the same period last year.   &gt;   &gt;During the pandemic, smartphone and PC makers stockpiled chips as demand for consumer devices increased, but they are now grappling with excess inventories as consumers cut back on purchases of these goods due to rising inflation. This has led to a fall in prices for the memory chips that Samsung sells.   &gt;   &gt;The South Korean giant said this month [it would be making a ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù]( cut in memory chip production, following the lead of smaller rivals such as SK Hynix and Micron.   &gt;   &gt;‚ÄúSamsung Electronics announced the disappointing number for the first quarter, but at the same time, they announced a meaningful production cut amid the severe memory chip downturn. After that, the market reacted positively on the news,‚Äù SK Kim of Daiwa Securities Capital Markets told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box Asia‚Äù on Thursday.   &gt;   &gt;Samsung did however forecast a recovery in the second-half of the year.   &gt;   &gt;‚ÄúDemand is expected to gradually recover in 2H amid projections that customer inventory levels will have declined,‚Äù Samsung said.   &gt;   &gt;[Samsung said it expects limited demand recovery]( as large-scale data centers invest more conservatively and customers continue to adjust inventories. Samsung also expects launches of new smartphones, PC promotions and expansion of new CPU adoption to boost memory chip demand.   &gt;   &gt;SK Hynix, a competitor to Samsung, [also guided for a recovery in memory chips]( when it reported a record quarterly loss on Wednesday,   &gt;   &gt;‚ÄúIf we got a rebound, it‚Äôs mostly driven by the production cut and some restocking demand. So we see, despite the disappointing earnings number, some positive investor sentiment on the stock,‚Äù said Kim.   &gt;   &gt;Samsung‚Äôs stock was around 0.6% higher on Thursday.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;**S23 Ultra gives mobile a boost**   &gt;   &gt;During the first quarter, Samsung launched its latest lines of flagship [smartphones called the S23 series]( which gave its mobile division a boost.   &gt;   &gt;Revenue at its mobile business grew 22% versus the previous quarter to 30.74 trillion won, but was down 2% versus the same period last year. Operating profit came in at 3.94 trillion won, up 3% year-on-year.   &gt;   &gt;Samsung was helped by sales of its highest priced smartphone ‚Äî the $1,200 S23 Ultra.   &gt;   &gt;‚ÄúThe premium market grew in terms of both volume and value even amid weak smartphone demand caused by lingering macro uncertainties,‚Äù Samsung said in a statement. ‚ÄúSales grew and profitability recovered to reach double-digits on the back of strong sales of new premium models, centering on S23 Ultra, and efforts to enhance operational efficiencies.‚Äù   &gt;   &gt;Overall, Samsung‚Äôs smartphone division appeared to remain resilient amid an overall tough quarter for the industry. Shipments of smartphones fell 13% year-on-year in the first quarter of the year, according to data released Thursday by market research firm Canalys. Samsung reclaimed the top spot globally in terms of smartphone market share, Canalys said.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;**Tech recovery underway?**   &gt;   &gt;Samsung is the latest tech company globally to report earnings after numbers from U.S. technology giants [Alphabet]( [Microsoft]( and [Meta](   &gt;   &gt;Daniel Yoo, head of global asset allocation at Yuanta Securities Korea, pointed to strong results from these American tech firms.   &gt;   &gt;Meta saw [first-quarter sales boosted by advertising from Chinese companies]( while Microsoft posted¬†[third-quarter results](¬†that beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines.   &gt;   &gt;‚ÄúI do think that the recovery story is coming.

The Santa Clara, California-based company controls about 80% of high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock market value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023.  Nvidia's customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT.O), opens new tab, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab and Meta Platforms (META.O), opens new tab, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of its chips to compete in the fast-emerging generative AI sector.  Its H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time to design.  Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to rival firms such as Broadcom (AVGO.O), opens new tab and Marvell Technology (MRVL.O), opens new tab, said the sources, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  "If you're really trying to optimize on things like power, or optimize on cost for your application, you can't afford to go drop an H100 or A100 in there," Greg Reichow, general partner at venture capital firm Eclipse Ventures said in an interview. "You want to have the exact right mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need."  Nvidia does not disclose H100 prices, which are higher than for the prior-generation A100, but each chip can sell for $16,000 to $100,000 depending on volume and other factors. Meta plans to bring its total stock to 350,000 H100s this year. Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon.com (AMZN.O), opens new tab, Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for them, two sources familiar with the meetings said. Beyond data center chips, Nvidia has pursued telecom, automotive and video game customers.  Nvidia shares rose 2.75% after the Reuters report, helping lift chip stocks overall. Marvell shares dropped 2.78%.  In 2022, Nvidia said it would let third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking technology with their own chips. It has said nothing about the program since, and Reuters is reporting its wider ambitions for the first time. A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company's 2022 announcement.  Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), opens new tab and Marvell executive, heads Nvidia's custom unit and her team's goal is to make its technology available for customers in cloud, 5G wireless, video games and automotives, a LinkedIn profile said. Those mentions were scrubbed and her title changed after Reuters sought comment from Nvidia.  Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment.     **$30 BILLION MARKET**  According to estimates from research firm 650 Group‚Äôs Alan Weckel, the data center custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year, and double that in 2025.  The broader custom chip market was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023, which amounts to roughly 5% of annual global chip sales, according to Needham analyst Charles Shi.  Currently, custom silicon design for data centers is dominated by Broadcom and Marvell.  In a typical arrangement, a design partner such as Nvidia would offer intellectual property and technology, but leave the chip fabrication, packaging and additional steps to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330.TW), opens new tab or another contract chip manufacturer.  Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales.  "With Broadcom's custom silicon business touching $10 billion, and Marvell‚Äôs around $2 billion, this is a real threat," said Dylan Patel, founder of silicon research group SemiAnalysis. "It's a real big negative - there's more competition entering the fray."  **BEYOND AI**  Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson (ERICb.ST), opens new tab for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics processing unit (GPU) technology, two sources familiar with the discussions said. Ericsson declined to comment.  650 Group's Weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year. Nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video game markets, according to sources and public social media postings.  Weckel expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6 billion to $8 billion range at 20% a year, and the $7 billion to $8 billion video game custom chip market could increase with the next-generation consoles from Xbox and Sony (6857.T), opens new tab.  Nintendo's current Switch handheld console already includes Nvidia's Tegra X1 chip. A new version of the Switch console expected this year is likely to include a Nvidia custom design, one source said.  Nintendo declined to comment.,;,; 2024-02-09 23:15:02]

[Stocks for shorting in 2024 -Would you?,;,; The last quarter of 2023 (October-December) saw a strong rally in the US stock market, particularly in November and December. While various stocks saw impressive gains, the top performers varied depending on the specific timeframe and metric used (e.g., absolute gain, percentage gain, market cap). Here are some options to consider:        Overall Top Performers:        AppLovin (APP): +255.9% year-to-date (based on 2023 performance), driven by strong AI-powered advertising performance and positive financials.

Nvidia (NVDA): +122.5% in the last quarter, fueled by booming data center business and optimism about AI applications.    Meta Platforms (META): +85.4% in the last quarter, rebounding from a 2022 downturn thanks to recovering online advertising demand.    Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL): +68.7% in the last quarter, as travel and leisure stocks benefited from easing pandemic concerns.    Other notable gainers:        Palo Alto Networks (PANW): +48.5% in the last quarter, driven by cybersecurity demand amid increasing cyber threats.    Tesla (TSLA): +44.2% in the last quarter, propelled by positive electric vehicle deliveries and production ramp-up.    PulteGroup (PHM): +43.2% in the last quarter, buoyed by strong housing market trends and favorable mortgage rates.    Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): +42.1% in the last quarter, benefiting from chip shortages and robust demand for its processors.    Carnival Corporation (CCL): +41.3% in the last quarter, mirroring RCL's recovery in the cruise line industry.,;,; 2023-12-30 15:08:48]

[Snap stock surges on report that Biden may ban TikTok,;,; KEY POINTS  &gt;Snap shares surged nearly 8% to $11.15 while Meta shares rose a little over 3% to $203.49 after The Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok faces a possible ban in the U.S. if ByteDance fails to comply with the Biden Administration's proposition.  &gt;Investors believe that if TikTok were to be banned in the U.S., social media companies like Snapchat and Meta would regain users lost to the short-form video platform.  &gt;ByteDance said in a statement that "If protecting national security is the objective, divestment doesn't solve the problem: a change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access."   2023-03-16 05:50:49]

[Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) $171 A good long term buy,;,; \#AMD‚Äôs MI300 chips will be its growth engine for the future and the key reason for buying this stock. While I don‚Äôt believe it will get close to Nvidia‚Äôs near monopolistic market share of 80% there is ample room for more competitors and AMD will benefit from the AI boom as well.   It recently upped its guidance for 2024 for artificial intelligence-related revenue to $3.5B up from $2B previously.  $AMD Chief Executive Dr. Lisa Su said she had "good confidence" the company will be able to exceed the $3.5B figure this year and the $1.5B run-rate for the coming fourth-quarter. $1.5Bn run rate implies $6Bn in annual sales.   However, based on Citi analyst estimates, AMD is likely to generate $5B this year and $8B next year from the MI300 - they believe that Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are the largest customers for the MI300, which was unveiled in December to much fanfare. And with the average selling price at roughly $10,000 for Microsoft and $15,000 or more for other customers, it's possible AMD is purposefully underestimating sales figures, possibly on supply concerns?   For Q4-2023 AMD results were in line with expectations   EPS: $0.77 per share, adjusted, versus $0.77 per share expected   Revenue: $6.17 billion, versus $6.12 billion expected   Data Center revenue $2.28Bn in line V $2.29 expected.   Guidance was light:   Q1-24 $5.4Bn in sales, plus or minus $300 million, V $5.73 Bn expected.   Flat data center revenue with server chip declines to be offset by AI GPU sales. We saw weak data center revenue from Intel, this is definitely some cannibalization and likely to continue, till AI GPU starts taking a larger share of the pie.   Client Group - The recovery in PC‚Äôs helped AMD‚Äôs client group, which rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.   Gaming, which includes ‚Äúsemi-custom‚Äù processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù double-digit percentage in the current quarter. This is a low margin business and drags AMD‚Äôs overall margins.   AMD‚Äôs embedded segment, which includes chips for networking, reported $1.1 billion in sales, down 24% on an annual basis.,;,; 2024-02-10 22:08:45]
[AAPL price dump after VR headset reveal,;,; The price movement was directly correlated with the VR headset announcement along with the demo of features.  * Yes, it looks like ski goggles. * The OS is called **Vision Pro** * The VR OS is similar to Microsoft's Mixed Reality with their Hololens product which came out 8 years ago...  One of the **selling features** is that your eyes are visible, but the headset will conceal your eyes when you're fully immersed in an app.. which may or may not be groundbreaking as it didn't perfectly reveal your eyes (perhaps because there wasn't enough lighting inside the goggles to show your eyes clearly, but I think this could be fixed w/ software or by adding LED lights on the inside edges), however:  * If you can keep your headset on while talking to people in the room compared to the competition, this feature alone would win out  Price tag is $3500, but again this is the dev conference, so the consumer version of this product will come later, although I can see how a lot of developers might want to buy this thing (also consider that Apple has the largest developer network) compared to competitor headsets which cost 7x less (META is coming out with a $500 VR headset).  Something to note, the stock dropped nearly 1.5% during all the free features (before the VR headset) that were going to be included to existing users, however that did coincide with the market indexes dropping as well.  Total drop from the peak was around 3.5% however the stock recovered nearly a percent, today's loss is only around 0.75% after falling from making another new 52w all time high.  Trading volume was 2x the normal average, so ending red is very significant.  META &amp; MSFT stayed relatively flat compared to AAPL.  Overall I think this was bad news for the stock in the short term; buy the rumor sell the news type event.  If the VR headset was truly revolutionary, stock price would have gone much higher, **so we have to wait &amp; see what Apple developers can do with this headset for consumers &amp; what Apple's actual consumer version of the headset will be.**  Than after 12 to 18 months when the killer apps come out, re-evaluate Apple's VR headset.  FYI I own AAPL stock,;,; 2023-06-05 20:27:12]

[AI feels so overrated. Can someone explain the hype?,;,; So I‚Äôve heard several times throughout the year that the rally is being driven by AI stocks. That AI is the future and is going to change the entire technological landscape and life as we know it. But I don‚Äôt understand why or how?   This feels like when people were drooling over 5G and 5G connectivity. So 5G stocks were all the rage and 5G was supposed to take internet connectivity to heights unseen. And 5G was just ‚Äúmeh‚Äù and came and went.   Then it was the Metaverse. Facebook changed the name of their company. It would entirely change how we interact with each other. It was supposed to be as big as the internet. Oculus goggles would be the biggest Christmas gift. Everyone was looking for the next meta verse play in the stock market. And then it kind of just stopped being popular and talked about.  This AI feels eerily similar to these things and I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs different.

[Nvidia hits $1 trillion market cap,;,;   Nvidia briefly hit a $1 trillion market cap at the open Tuesday, joining a small club of mostly technology companies. Nvidia‚Äôs shares have to hold above $404.86 to maintain that distinction throughout the day. The chipmaker‚Äôs stock rocketed last week after it posted quarterly earnings with top- and bottom-line numbers that significantly beat consensus estimates. Nvidia‚Äôs gain buoyed other chipmakers, with the notable exception of Intel, and was also fueled in part by estimates that were more optimistic than expected.  Significantly, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 alone. Expected sales were 50% higher than consensus estimates of $7.15 billion. It‚Äôs been a banner year for chipmakers, parts of the tech industry and the Nasdaq, driven in part by the AI frenzy and the possibility of slowing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Alongside Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were also buoyed in last week‚Äôs trading.  Nvidia‚Äôs graphics processing units, or GPUs, are critical to generative AI platforms like OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and Google‚Äôs Bard. The company has historically been a leader in the so-called ‚Äúdiscrete‚Äù or standalone GPU field, but until recently, many consumers thought of GPUs as primarily used for intensive gaming. The advent of crypto mining and AI has upended that belief, and GPU manufacturers and suppliers, including Nvidia, AMD and TSMC, have seen share prices rise significantly over the last few months. By contrast, Intel, which struggled with inventory issues and development challenges, has been historically focused on the chip market for central processing units, or CPUs. The company hasn‚Äôt shared, comparatively, in the wave of investor interest.,;,; 2023-05-30 13:56:48]
[Growth stocks-is it starting to feel like early 2021?,;,; Edit-early 2022.    I understand no one has a crystal ball.   I understand the market can remain irrational longer than I can remain solvent.    Back in early 2021, it seemed like growth stocks could only go up, and even though stock prices were at irrationally high levels, I remember telling myself 'time in the market beats timing the market' ' literally the week before growth stocks took a 50% + beating and would trend down for a year.     I recognise that I partially lucked out, selling my falling knives and buying back into companies like NVDA sub 150, meta sub 100 etc.     Most of my investments were in an S&amp;P500 tracker, which obviously had a much gentler fall.

[Mark Zuckerberg is worth $100 billion for first time since February 2022,;,; Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs fortune hit the $100 billion threshold Thursday for the first time since February 2022, making him the world‚Äôs 11th richest person, per Forbes‚Äô calculations. Shares of Meta Platforms, where Zuckerberg is CEO and co-founder, rose 3% for the day, lifting his fortune by $3 billion. Meta Platforms is the parent company of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as virtual reality arm Oculus.  Meta‚Äôs share price has been rising steadily since hitting a trough in November 2022, notching a nearly 220% gain. In November last year, Zuckerberg was worth $32.8 billion and ranked the world‚Äôs 29th richest. He fell out of the world‚Äôs top 10 richest in January 2022.        Meta‚Äôs stock is up largely due to analyst and investor optimism around the company‚Äôs cost cutting, which included 21,000 layoffs since November 2022. Zuckerberg has branded 2023 the ‚Äúyear of efficiency‚Äù for Meta.        Meta stock rebounded this week from a 2.8% drop last week, which market watchers tied to Apple‚Äôs launch of its new virtual reality headset, a competitor to Meta‚Äôs Quest. Meta has spent billions to gain market share in the virtual reality space.        The rise in Meta‚Äôs stock came amid a good day for stock indices: the S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average each closed up more than 1%, in part as a reaction to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs decision Wednesday to pause interest rate hikes. Meta‚Äôs stock is up 126% this year, far outpacing the tech-heavy Nasdaq‚Äôs 33% rise.        As of Thursday‚Äôs market close, Zuckerberg‚Äôs net worth is just $800 million shy of Google cofounder Sergey Brin, who is currently the world‚Äôs 10th richest.

[Snap plunges 25% on revenue miss and light guidance, as Middle East conflict creates ‚Äòheadwind‚Äô,;,; Snap reported revenue that trailed analysts‚Äô estimates on Tuesday and issued a forecast that came in a bit below Wall Street expectations. The stock plunged 20% in extended trading.  Here‚Äôs how the company did:  Earnings per share: 8 cents, adjusted, vs. 6 cents expected by analysts, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.  Revenue: $1.36 billion vs. $1.38 billion expected, according to LSEG.  Global Daily Active Users: 414 million vs. 412 million expected, according to StreetAccount.  Average revenue per user: $3.29 vs. $3.33 expected, according to StreetAccount.   Snap has struggled to rebound from the downturn in the digital ad market, and has now reported six straight quarters of single-digit growth or sales declines. For the fourth quarter, revenue rose about 5% year-over-year to $1.36 billion from $1.3 billion a year earlier.  For the second consecutive period, Snap attributed some of the weakness to the war in the Middle East, which erupted in October beginning with Hamas‚Äôs attack on Israel.  ‚ÄúWhile we are encouraged by the progress we are making with our ad platform and the improved results we are delivering for many of our advertising partners, we estimate that the onset of the conflict in the Middle East was a headwind to year-over-year growth of approximately 2 percentage points in Q4,‚Äù Snap said in a letter to investors.  Growth is expected to accelerate in the first quarter, but not quite as fast as analysts were expecting. Snap forecast sales for the quarter of $1.095 billion to $1.135 billion, representing about 11% growth at the midpoint of the range, which was $1.115 billion. Analysts were looking for revenue of $1.117 billion.  Daily active users for the first quarter will be 420 million, Snap said, slightly topping analyst estimates of 419.3 million.  Earlier this week, Snap said it would cut 10% of its global workforce, which equates to about 500 employees. A company spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that the cuts were intended to reorganize staff and ‚Äúreduce hierarchy and promote in-person collaboration.‚Äù In mid-2022, Snap eliminated about 1,000 employees, or 20% of its fulltime workforce.  Snap‚Äôs net loss for the quarter narrowed to $248.2 million, or 15 cents a share, which represents a 14% year-over-year decrease from $288.5 million, or 18 cents a share.  Snap said it expects an adjusted EBITDA loss between $55 million to $95 million in the first quarter, higher than analyst projections of $21.9 million. Last quarter, Snap issued an ‚Äúinternal forecast‚Äù for the fourth quarter instead of providing official guidance because of ‚Äúthe unpredictable nature of war,‚Äù referring to the Israel-Hamas war.  Snap on Tuesday disclosed sales its its Snapchat+ subscription service for the first time and said it had an annualized revenue run rate of $249 million in 2023. The service now has 7 million subscribers, up from five million in the previous quarter. Snap introduced the product in 2022, pitching it as a way for users to access early features. It came debuted that summer for $3.99 a month.  Snap‚Äôs growth in the fourth quarter lagged larger digital ad rivals like Meta, Amazon and Alphabet, which all reported double-digit expansion in their advertising units.  Snap and Pinterest are ‚Äúmuch smaller companies that have struggled to build substantial ad businesses, Debra Aho Williamson, an industry analyst, told CNBC. ‚ÄúIn this environment, the big are getting bigger,‚Äù  Last week, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel attended a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on child safety and technology alongside Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,  X CEO Linda Yaccarino, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and Discord CEO Jason Citron.

This is a stark contrast to the big companies in the last decades, be it Banks, oil companies, utilities....  Are the expectations different now? Is it just because a company is considered a software or internet related, then the stock is considered a growth stock? I don't get it. Amazon or Google are giant multinationals than will now grow as much as some AI or gaming startup, IMO they should be paying dividends to their shareholders, or are we past that line of thinking now?,;,; 2023-10-27 13:42:50]
[The world's wealthiest people have seen their fortunes grow by more than $150 billion thanks to the AI-fueled stock-market boom,;,; * AI-related stocks have seen a spectacular surge in 2023, following ChatGPT's smashing debut.     * Some of the world's wealthiest people have made a killing from the rally.     * Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and Oracle boss Larry Ellison have seen their personal fortunes swell by over $40 billion each.  Artificial intelligence has been one of the defining themes for stocks in 2023 ‚Äì and it's also helping the rich get richer.        The surge in interest in the intelligent language tool ChatGPT quickly spread across markets, with big-name investors rushing to snap up shares in companies they believe could power AI's rise to prominence.        Big Tech giants like Meta Platforms and Nvidia have already racked up triple-digit gains thanks to the AI boom, while Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, and Oracle have also all surged.        That's helped the companies' founders ‚Äì already among the world's richest people at the start of 2023 ‚Äì to become even wealthier.  Meta shares have rallied 134% year-to-date thanks to both the rise of AI and Zuckerberg's so-called "year of efficiency" cost cuts, and that's lifted the Facebook founder's wealth by over $57 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.        Meanwhile, Oracle founder Larry Ellison passed Bill Gates on the publication's rich list for the first time ever earlier this week, with his fortune up $47 billion in 2023 thanks to the tech stock's 55% gain.        Gates himself has gotten $24 billion richer this year thanks to his Microsoft shares, with the Redmond-based tech giant emerging as a preferred AI play for billionaire investors including Stanley Druckenmiller.        And the man at the helm of one of the stock market's biggest success story of 2023 ‚Äì Nvidia founder Jensen Huang ‚Äì has also seen his personal fortune balloon by $24 billion, according to Bloomberg's index.  Again, that's largely thanks to Huang's shares in the chipmaker, which have jumped 192% in value to lift the company to a $1 trillion market capitalization.        The members of the rich list have seen their combined wealth jump by over $150 billion in 2023, by Insider's calculations.,;,; 2023-06-20 06:06:37]

I mean, there are millions hooked on ChatGPT every day, and they can't even imagine life without it. And it hasn't even been a year since it blew up.  I'm betting there will be a flood of new AI-generated products on the horizon, and I'm pretty sure there's still a bunch of killer companies to invest in. $SMCI, for instance. Their ratios look solid in my book, and teaming up with Nvidia could totally launch them into the stratosphere. $MSFT, $NVDA, and $META ‚Äì they're all sitting pretty to ride this wave.

Assuming NVDA manages to hit the market's "shadow expectations" and thus rallies further, do you believe this would give strong tailwinds to the other tech giants (I'm thinking especially of MSFT and META)? Or could there be so much focus on NVDA that the others would temporarily remain flat/trend downwards?  Conversely if somehow the earnings disappoint, what scenarios do you guys envisage?

[SMCI is undervalued at $600,;,; SMCI‚Äôs Quarterly revenue was $3.66 billion, P/E ratio - 41.38, Mkt. Cap - 32.41 billion. Their guidance says their annual revenue for 2024 will be around 14-15 billion. Profitability looks good, free cash flow around $450 million. Their server racks are the fastest to hit the market and they have reasonable moat, good relations with nvidia, AMD, Microsoft, and Meta.   Now let‚Äôs take a look at some other stocks, AMD‚Äôs revenue is around $6.5 billion latest quarter, and market cap is around $275.38 billion, FCF - 1 billion. Sure AMD and super micro are not in the same league but they will both benefit equally from AI boom and are operating under nvidia‚Äôs shadows.

[Are stocks telling us a pullback is ahead?,;,; During Thanksgiving week, typically marked by reduced stock trading volume, key stocks like **Microsoft (MSFT)**, **Amazon**, **Adobe Systems**, and **Meta Platforms** hit 52-week highs.    **The S&amp;P 500** had risen 11% from its October low, with its relative strength index (RSI) reaching 71.3, suggesting potential overbought conditions. The Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq-100 also had elevated RSIs, indicating traders' uncertainty amid the battle for control of artificial intelligence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw an RSI of 71.2, influenced by Microsoft's new high.    While RSIs above 70 generally warn of a potential pullback, the current levels do not indicate extreme conditions.   Analysts foresee stocks rising into the new year, although gains may be more modest given recent increases since October. A pullback could present a watchful opportunity for bargain hunting.    ,;,; 2023-11-24 10:37:28]

[Top picks for 2024? Let‚Äôs go!!,;,; Hey guys with the new year around I was thinking what you guys are looking into buying and holding starting Jan 2024.   Here are two screening rules.  - must be listed in US (nasdaq or nyse) - must be an index stock with a market cap above 20B  Major factors for me are - interest rate cuts  - gen ai  - value vs market.   My top 5 picks for the new year: - Amazon. Overall a great company, but with the whole AI race and AWS providing it as a service, I think there will be some good tail winds for this stock in the new year.   Google: the latest AI show and tell from Google was mind blowing. They have a chatgpt killer. I think Google is back as the leader in ai based search.  Palo Alto Networks: cyber security is still going to be big in the next year and Palo Alto is comparative priced better when compared to Crowdstrike and others and they have products that align better for SMBs. So I feel they would have a good upside in comparison to competition.   Adobe:  I think this is another gen ai play. I feel with the whole digital media space has been really disrupted with gen ai. I would have loved to see the whole Figma purchase go through but nonetheless I think there is a lot going on here and I will see a lot of general users coming onboard adobe  now as the learning curve has just got flatter.   PayPal: this stock has done soo bad and fallen soo much that it‚Äôs just dead cheap in comparison to the sp500. With new leadership I feel things are going to see some improvement in the coming year.

[Was the Activision Blizzard actually beneficial for ATVI shareholders?,;,; I can't help thinking this was a massive mistake by shareholders to vote for this. This is a pretty amazing company that would have had solid returns for years. But instead shareholders got a bit of a payout and the company was bought for $68 billion which I think will seem pretty measly in a few years. Their IP like Call of Duty and WoW would have kept paying out for a long time. Their financials were excellent and I'm pretty sure their p/e was low 20's at the buyout price. Since then, loads of companies have had their multiples expand- Apple, Microsoft, Google, Meta are all in the high 20's and 30's.   Just seems like a horrible decision in hindsight, even if the company was going through a pretty turbulent period. ,;,; 2024-01-08 01:31:02]
[Ultimate Nvidia DD (The Best),;,; First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens.        It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark.    No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space.        First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently?        You could say it‚Äôs because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood.    It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT.        AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks.        How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype?    Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it‚Äôs not just any Product. It‚Äôs a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.    An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.        This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).        This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.        They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.        How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else.        Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:        \- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees        \- Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)        \- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)        \- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers        The Analogy:        ‚ÄûPrivate customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).        TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.        The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.        At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.        Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.        Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.        What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.        Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.‚Äú        \----        NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.        Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that‚Äôs their moat. This tells me that the person doesn‚Äôt know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.        NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They ‚Äûonly‚Äú design them.        Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It‚Äôs TSMC.    TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.        So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big ‚ÄûChip Design Company‚Äú. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult ‚Äúmoat‚Äù part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.        There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.        So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.    Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?    This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.        Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.        AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.        Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they‚Äôre building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.        According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.        Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!        Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:        ‚ÄûHowever, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple‚Äôs GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.        Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple‚Äôs commitment to developing its own graphics technology.‚Äú (Does Apple use Nvidia? (ts2.com.pl)        Because you are all regarded, here are the links where major companies have declared that they will design their own chips:        Microsoft: Microsoft is finally making custom chips ‚Äî and they‚Äôre all about AI - The Verge        Meta: Exclusive: Meta to deploy in-house custom chips this year to power AI drive - memo | Reuters        Google: Google Training Gemini On Its Own Chips Reveals Another Of Its Advantages (forbes.com)        ChatGPT: Exclusive: ChatGPT-owner OpenAI is exploring making its own AI chips | Reuters        In the meantime, Meta and Microsoft say they will buy AMDS new AI Chip as an alternative to Nvidia: Meta and Microsoft to buy AMD's new AI chip as alternative to Nvidia (cnbc.com)        Since I feel so validated by the links above, I'll stop writing my DD, which would have additionally dealt with NVIDIA's past as a company (acquisitions) and the tricks to gain advantage in the consumer graphics card market (Raytracing, PhysiX).,;,; 2024-02-16 18:18:36]

[This doesn't feel sustainable for a nearly $1 TRILLION Company!,;,; tl;dr at bottom   Not trying to start a debate, I'm not long or short $NVDA, don't own any, and I don't plan to open a position anytime soon, I'm just your monthly buyer of $VOO and $QQQ.    However, to the bulls out there, what is the reason for such a MASSIVE premium for this stock?  I understand they crushed earnings and increased foecast to a nearly 50% gain in revenue by Q1 2024, but even with that premium, they are trading at a nearly 200 P/E.    Assuming NVDA maintains that 50% premium and holds it for all 4-quarters in 2024, thats $44B in revenue which if they had 100% margins and zero cost of any kind, it would take you almost 22 years to payback the value of the stock.   Sure, someone will tell me P/Es don't matter, and they are growing like crazy, but at what point is the value of the stock (again, almost $1 TRILLION) still out of control?   \- Their Gross Profit is 56% which is impressive, but not unherd of (MSFT is 68%, META is 80%)    \- Their net income is 16% which is right in line with everyones favoriate not a car company TESLA at 15%  Lets throw out fundamentals since they clearly don't matter that much for this stock and look at their growth:  $7.19B (lower than Q1 2022 of $8.29B).    Their Q4 22 Revenue was $6.05B vs. Q4 21 of $7.64B  So grow is slower/stagnant from the previsous years, so why does that get such a massive premium?  Did they beat earnings estimates, yes, but those were concervitive.  Did they raise guidance by 50% due to the AI boom, yeah, how long will that last?  Same length as the gaming/crypto/at home boom?

[NYT: Palantir may be on the brink of a US$590 million contract to overhaul Britain‚Äôs NHS,;,; &gt; It began with a ¬£1 contract.  &gt; In the hours after a pandemic was declared in March 2020, Palantir, the secretive American data analytics company, was invited to 10 Downing Street along with other tech groups, including Amazon, Google and Meta, to discuss how it could help the British government respond.  &gt; Within days, Palantir‚Äôs software was processing streams of data from across England‚Äôs National Health Service, with Palantir engineers embedded to help. The company‚Äôs services, used by the C.I.A. and Western militaries for more than a decade, were deployed to track emergency room capacity and direct supplies of scarce equipment.  &gt; Palantir charged the government just one pound.  &gt; The deal provided the company with a valuable toehold. Since then, Palantir, which is chaired by Peter Thiel, the billionaire investor and one of President Donald J. Trump‚Äôs major 2016 donors, has parlayed the work into more than ¬£60 million in government health contracts. Its biggest reward may be yet to come: a seven-year contract worth up to ¬£480 million ‚Äî about $590 million ‚Äî to overhaul N.H.S.

[How US stocks rose 20% from their lows, and where they might be going,;,; U.S. stocks have defied fears of a recession, a banking crisis and soaring Treasury yields to rise 20% from their October lows - one definition of a bull market.        The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index closed at a low of 3,577.03 on Oct. 12, 2022, down 25% from its all-time high after the Federal Reserve unleashed a series of bruising interest rate increases to fight decades-high inflation.        On Thursday, it closed up 0.6% at 4,293.93, amid growing optimism over the economic outlook and a rate hiking cycle that appears to be nearing its end. Here are some features of the index's rally, and a look at where stocks might go from here.  While markets seldom rise in a straight line, the S&amp;P 500's journey from the bottom took 164 days - the longest 20% climb from a bear market low in five decades. Among the factors holding stocks back was a surge in Treasury yields to their highest levels in decades that dulled the allure of equities by offering investors the potential to earn attractive income in government-backed bonds.        A crisis that saw the biggest bank busts since the Great Recession also shook investor confidence, as did worries over a potentially catastrophic fight over lifting the U.S. debt ceiling.  The narrow breadth of the S&amp;P 500's rally has been a concern for some investors, with just seven stocks - Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) - responsible for almost all of the index's gains this year. Many investors view these stocks as safe bets in uncertain times. Their gains were also driven by excitement over advances in artificial intelligence.  More recently, however, the market's gains have shown tentative signs of broadening out to other stocks.  Meanwhile, volatility has subsided - not only in stocks, but in Treasuries and currencies.        One reason for the calm in markets is investors' belief that the Fed is unlikely to deliver many more of the rate hikes that shook asset prices last year.        Investors have also been encouraged by evidence showing that the U.S. economy continues to be resilient in the face of the central bank's monetary tightening, while inflation slowly cools. The U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (.CESIUSD) shows U.S. economic data has in aggregate topped market expectations, helped by stronger than expected numbers for employment and consumer spending.        A 20% gain from bear market lows has in the past heralded further upside for stocks.  In four of the last six bear markets, the S&amp;P went on to rise 20% or more in the six months after hitting this milestone.  [  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-06-09 09:07:00]
[Please don't flame me. What is your take on $CRSR - Corsair Gaming?,;,; I jumped on the $CRSR train when they IPOd. My worst investment ever. I am down 50% on the stock and have had probably U$7k of calls expire worthless.  I don't need the money at all, but I will in 2 or 3 years. What would you do? Sell covered calls? Dump it all? Average down?  I feel so stupid because I put a lot of money into $CRSR as an inexperienced trader. Now I realize they have no moat and not a lot of people are buying the highest end stuff in this economy. There's also the fact any significant run up might die out when the main holder (Eagle Tree Capital) dumps, like they did in the past.  Last couple of years I bought $INTC, $META, $GOOG and they all killed but I put way less money into them and now looking back I want to slap myself. Anyway.,;,; 2023-11-30 16:39:22]

MSFT, GOOG also benefits from AI but given their wide products and diversified business, just feel this will limit their growth.  Tesla is also a good option for growth, but its CEO just too unpredictable, and Tesla has lots of competitors while Nvidia has strong moat for both software CUDA and hardware.

[Why wouldn't you invest a large amount of money into Pfizer right now and ride it out for a few years?,;,; Comparing them to LLY right now, and while LLY might have more upside and is more innovative, I feel like a lot of their future potential is priced in.  PFE revenue last quarter was 13.23 billion and their market cap is 166.44 billion.  LLY revenue last quarter was 9.5 billion and their market cap is 567.41 billion.  PFE is trading at the same price as it was a decade ago. It's a blue chip stock, no? Seems like it's being sold for really cheap, why not buy?  I feel like it's being viewed as a WSB stock with no value behind it when it's literally a pharma giant. I work in healthcare, not an hour goes by where I'm not handling a drug owned by PFE. Not to mention the standard of care, at least in Canada, is becoming "annual COVID shot" (similar to annual flu shot), i.e. continued revenue source for years, no? We were only buying Pfizer and Moderna shots at my hospital, I don't think this revenue stream will run dry anytime soon.,;,; 2023-11-13 07:26:33]

[Where are you building positions?,;,; I have a very small portfolio, about 14k. Over the last few years I lost a very, very substantial amount of money as a % of my portfolio making stupid trades. Mostly trying to be too cute with long dated call options that went terribly in the wrong direction and expired worthless, credit spreads, chasing some WSB tickers. Basically trading like I'm in a literal casino.  The last 18 months or so I've mostly gotten back on the right track and have been building positions in the big names that have been traditionally good bets over a long horizon. Google, apple, Amazon, meta, tesla, Microsoft, Nvidia, visa, you get the idea. I recently started a new job and can comfortably put $1000 a month into the market to chase some growth while equally contributing to my savings.  Something nearly all of these companies have in common is that they are all hovering at or near 52 week highs and while I'm not entirely deterred by that it gives me some pause.  Personally my next thought is to build a bigger position in the s&amp;p and nasdaq indices over the next few months since I'm currently concentrated in individual companies.   Beyond that I'm looking into different oil / ng etfs because I don't have any exposure there.

As of now we can only find AI stocks like META APPL AMZN GOOG all of the big tech giants which already have a huge market cap.

[Microsoft stock hits a record high. Why its next move might be lower,;,; Microsoft stock reached a new all-time closing high‚Äîbut there could be some hiccups ahead in the short term.        Microsoft's stock rose 1.1% to $360.53 on Tuesday. That's a new closing high, topping the previous high of $359.49 set on July 18. Furthermore, Microsoft has won for eight days in a row, its longest winning streak since January 28, 2021.        The stock has been helped by the company‚Äôs strong earnings and sales, which got a boost from the Azure cloud business.        But it‚Äôs not just earnings. Microsoft was already outperforming its peers following tech weakness in August and September. Its stock has gained 15% since the end of September, outpacing Amazon.com (AMZN), which has risen 12%, Meta Platforms (META), which has risen 6.5%, Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), which is up 6%, Alphabet (GOOGL) which has ticked up 0.3%, and Tesla (TSLA), which has dropped 13%.        So, why be concerned? It all comes down to the 14-day relative strength index from Microsoft. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a measure of a stock's or index's momentum, or lack thereof. The closer it comes to 20 on the negative, the more oversold it is, while a score close to 80 indicates that the stock is extremely overbought. A value below 30 usually indicates that a stock is about to rally, while a score above 60 indicates a likely decline. Microsoft's RSI is at 72.75, indicating that it is becoming quite overbought and that a pullback is possible.        That doesn‚Äôt mean Microsoft isn‚Äôt worth buying for its long-term potential. The company has a lot to recommend, including a cloud business that should get a boost as ChatGPT, which held its developer conference yesterday, looks to expand. It just means that investors might get a better opportunity to pick up shares in the days ahead.        ,;,; 2023-11-08 11:35:51]

[Washington prepares for war with Amazon on mergers, antitrust, privacy and more,;,; The Biden administration is planning to take action soon on at least three of its half-dozen investigations of Amazon ‚Äî moves that could lead to a blitz of litigation to rein in the iconic tech-industry giant.  The FTC has been investigating the internet titan on multiple fronts dating at least back to 2019, looking into its abuse of power within its online marketplace, as well as potential consumer-privacy violations connected to its Ring cameras and Alexa digital assistant.  The agency is also reviewing Amazon‚Äôs purchase of robot vacuum maker iRobot. Any suit against Amazon would be a high-profile move by the agency under chair Lina Khan, a Big Tech skeptic who rose to prominence with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in.  Although Amazon has already been hit by local antitrust suits in Washington, D.C. and California, the coming federal cases would be the most significant challenges to the global company yet. The exact timing of any cases or settlements is unknown.  POLITICO spoke to more than 10 people with direct knowledge of the investigations by the FTC‚Äôs competition and consumer protection teams to put together a comprehensive picture of how the agency is now pursuing Amazon, why it didn‚Äôt take action on the company‚Äôs most recent major acquisition of One Medical and what is likely to happen in the coming months. According to those people, who were granted anonymity to discuss confidential investigations:  The FTC is currently weighing whether to challenge Amazon‚Äôs $1.7 billion acquisition of robot vacuum maker iRobot, with the agency‚Äôs staff attorneys leaning toward suing to stop the deal according to three people with knowledge of that investigation. That case could come in the next few months. It has at least two open privacy investigations, one into Amazon‚Äôs Ring camera and security system business, and the other into its Alexa voice assistant over potential violations of the Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act, according to four people with knowledge of those cases. The result of at least one of the FTC‚Äôs privacy investigations could come in the next couple of months, one of the people said. FTC staff previously recommended filing a lawsuit over alleged privacy and data security violations at Ring before Khan started. Also potentially coming in the next few months is a wide-ranging antitrust case targeting Amazon‚Äôs retail operations, multiple people with knowledge of the probe said. Though the details of a complaint are not known, it could include the bundling of services through its Prime subscription business and its use of competitor data to out-muscle rival retailers on its platform, according to some of those people. The FTC has been investigating nearly every aspect of the company‚Äôs business since 2019, and a lawsuit has long been expected. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that an antitrust case could be filed against Amazon in the coming months. The FTC is pursuing a so-called ‚Äúdark pattern‚Äù probe into the difficulty customers have unsubscribing from Prime and other services. Dark patterns are deceptive tactics used by websites to trick users into doing things like subscribing to a more expensive service than they intended. It is also conducting a deceptive advertising probe into the ‚ÄúAmazon Choice‚Äù label the company gives certain products on its marketplace. The FTC is investigating how that label is used to promote products that appear in search results, including whether it is pay-to-play. Amazon maintains it is not.

BY JOHN HENDEL Representatives for the FTC and Amazon both declined to comment on the investigations.  The lack of action so far shows the difficulties facing the agency in taking on a company as multifaceted as Amazon ‚Äî and suggests the FTC is picking its cases with caution, according to some of the people, who are familiar with the agency‚Äôs strategy.  The FTC has sued Amazon before, accusing it of illegally withholding tips from some delivery drivers. The company settled the case and paid almost $60 million to reimburse drivers.  Top enforcement officials in the Biden administration have aggressively gone after corporate mergers and tech firms in the past year. The FTC last year sued to block Microsoft‚Äôs $69 billion purchase of Activision, and the Justice Department has two separate lawsuits against Google over its search and advertising businesses in addition to preparing an antitrust case against Apple.  The FTC is also coming off a loss in its case to block Meta‚Äôs acquisition of a popular virtual reality app. While the judge in the case validated the FTC‚Äôs novel theory that it could be illegal for companies to acquire, rather than build, a product, he also said the agency did not have the facts to support its claims.  In that environment, the FTC is under immense pressure to bring a successful antitrust case against Amazon ‚Äî particularly after letting two of the company‚Äôs largest deals through without opposition in the past year, according to agency insiders and observers.  Amazon closed its $8.5 billion purchase of MGM Studios in March 2022, with the agency‚Äôs hands tied as its four commissioners at the time deadlocked along partisan lines on whether to intervene. Then last month, the agency elected to pass on challenging the company‚Äôs $3.9 billion purchase of the primary care provider One Medical despite agency officials‚Äô belief that the deal was anticompetitive, according to three people with knowledge of the agency‚Äôs decision.  The rumble over Roombas  Most of the FTC‚Äôs Amazon investigations were launched during the Trump administration, when Republican chair Joe Simons began a broad oversight push on tech giants.  One exception is the $1.7 billion iRobot deal ‚Äî along with One Medical ‚Äî which was announced in August 2022.  The agency has not yet concluded its investigation of the deal, and is continuing to collect documents and testimony from third parties, five of the people with knowledge of the review said.  FTC staff do not believe that Amazon, the leading online retailer in the U.S., should be allowed to buy the largest maker of a popular product sold on its platform, the people said.  Among its issues, those people said, the agency is concerned that Amazon will favor iRobot‚Äôs Roombas over competing brands of automated vacuums such as Samsung. The FTC is also concerned about how the addition of iRobot will add to the control Amazon has in the broader market for connected home devices. Amazon also owns the home security company Ring, and makes the popular voice assistant Alexa and Echo smart speaker. And the FTC is asking whether Amazon would withhold Roombas from competing retailers altogether.  The FTC has also asked how the deal would increase Amazon‚Äôs control over consumer data, as well as potential privacy harms, but that is not the main focus, according to some of the people.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working cooperatively with the relevant regulators in their review of the merger. We have no plans to operate iRobot differently than how they operate today in regards to its availability through other retailers,‚Äù said Amazon spokesperson Curtis Eichelberger. ‚ÄúWe will continue to supply other retailers and vendors with iRobot products, and continue to sell other products on Amazon.com.‚Äù Amazon also plans to maintain iRobot‚Äôs interoperability with other voice assistants, Eichelberger said.  Amazon has been largely unresponsive to the FTC‚Äôs investigation so far, refusing to turn over information requested by the FTC, some of the people said.  For a targeted company, this can be a strategy to run out the clock: Merger reviews are governed by strict statutory time restrictions. In an in-depth review of a merger, the government has 30 days to decide whether to sue once a company meets all the investigative demands. Companies often agree to give the FTC or Justice Department more time, but Amazon has made no such concession, sources said.  In this case though, the FTC likely has time, given the companies also need approval in the EU and UK before they can close their deal. Those reviews are still in the early stages.

The FTC is currently weighing whether to challenge Amazon‚Äôs $1.7 billion acquisition of robot vacuum maker iRobot, with the agency‚Äôs staff attorneys leaning toward suing to stop the deal according to three people with knowledge of that investigation. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Why the FTC didn‚Äôt try to block the One Medical deal  One reason for FTC‚Äôs lack of action on Amazon so far, say experts, is that it‚Äôs technically very hard to bring cases against tech giants, either for enforcers or private plaintiffs ‚Äî in part because they control all the data that enforcers need to build a case.  ‚ÄúThe platforms have an enormous information advantage and unique access to the evidence that the government or plaintiffs need to meet their burden of proof,‚Äù said Amanda Lewis, in Senate testimony this month. Lewis is a partner with Cuneo, Gilbert and Laduca, and previously worked at the FTC and as a Hill staffer on tech and antitrust issues.  Another illustration of the difficulty is the most recent antitrust case the agency didn‚Äôt pursue against Amazon: Its $3.9 billion purchase of One Medical, a primary care company providing access to doctors through individual and corporate subscriptions.  The FTC extensively investigated the One Medical deal and found evidence of anticompetitive behavior that many at the agency considered damning, but ultimately cleared the deal because they saw it as too hard of a case to win, according to multiple people with knowledge of the agency‚Äôs thinking.  That evidence includes Amazon‚Äôs decision to abruptly end lengthy negotiations to poach some of One Medical‚Äôs corporate customers with cheaper pricing in favor of killing off its competing Amazon Care service and acquiring the company, those people said.  In one instance, Amazon was trying to lure the ride-hailing company Lyft to sign a deal for its own health care service, according to three people with knowledge of Lyft‚Äôs testimony during the merger review. Amazon offered to substantially undercut One Medical on price and offered a national network of doctors ‚Äî but when Lyft was ready to sign with Amazon, the retail giant announced its takeover of One Medical, pulled out of negotiations with Lyft, and then said it was shutting down Amazon Care, the three people said.  A spokesperson for Lyft declined to comment.  Other companies had similar testimony, two of the people said. Though many FTC staffers saw that behavior as anti-competitive and illegal ‚Äî acquiring a competitor rather than competing on the merits ‚Äî the agency ultimately decided it would be too challenging to define exactly what market Amazon was monopolizing, some of the people said.  ‚ÄúWe decided independent of, and prior to, the One Medical acquisition, that the Amazon Care offering and business model wasn‚Äôt going to work long-term,‚Äù Eichelberger said.  For the FTC, time is not on their side. With just 19 months until the election and a potential change in administration, it‚Äôs in the agency‚Äôs interest to move on these cases as quickly as possible, lest priorities change in a new regime.,;,; 2023-03-21 12:50:49]

The five elephant stocks then bucked the trend and rose:  GOOGL 2.28%  META 1.92%  MSFT 1.78%  AMZN 1.39%  AAPL 0.26%  The auto industry is currently in a recession, and TSLA will be affected, so it has been a little weak recently.  Chip design duo AMD and NVDA have not been dragged down by semiconductors and bucked the trend today. INTC came back from failure, rising 9.35% in the first five trading days.  One strategy is to only buy stocks that have risen sharply rather than stocks that have fallen sharply, because from the lessons of last year, we can understand that thunderstorms have no bottom. Even META TSLA has experienced a collapse of more than 70% from its high point. On the contrary, if the big rising stocks are still 30% to 40% off from the historical high, and the p/e is very low, they are still very cheap.,;,; 2023-03-16 19:15:21]

[The 2023 stock market rally got a lot healthier in June and July,;,;   July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.  The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May.  July has come and gone for investors, bringing with it a continuation and a new twist on the blistering stock market gains seen in the first half of this year.  The Tech sector (XLK), along with some of last year's biggest losers like Communication Services (XLC) and Consumer Discretionary (XLY), powered the market's rally through May. [Money doesn't grow on trees]  But over the last two months, one of the biggest concerns among market bears ‚Äî that the rally had become too concentrated ‚Äî has been addressed with all 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) logging gains between June and July.  And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.  This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.  Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.  [**Broadening of the market.**](  In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.  The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.  Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.  And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)  Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.  In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.  Cyclical names ‚Äî whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy ‚Äî dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).  And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.  The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.  Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart ‚Äî up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.  3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).  Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.  Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%.

[Pinterest shares crater 25% on weak revenue and forecast,;,; Pinterest shares plummeted 25% in extended trading on Thursday after the company issued a weaker-than-expected forecast and missed on revenue.  Revenue: $981 million vs. $991 million expected, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.  Earnings: 53 cents per share, adjusted, vs. 51 cents per share expected, according to LSEG.   Revenue rose 12% year-over-year from $877.2 million a year earlier, while net income was $201 million, or 29 cents a share, up from $17.49 million, or 3 cents a share, a year ago. it brought in the previous year.  Monthly active users in the fourth quarter rose 11% to 498 million, topping analyst estimates of 487 million. The company said its global average revenue per user was $2, lower than analyst estimates of $2.05.  Pinterest said first-quarter revenue will be between $690 million and $705 million, which equates to year-over-year growth of 15% to 17%. The middle of that range, $697.5 million, is below the average analyst estimate of $703 million.  Pinterest‚Äôs report comes as the broader digital advertising market is showing recovery, with Meta , Alphabet  and Amazon  all picking up steam and growing their ad business by double digits in the fourth quarter. The data suggests that businesses are boosting spending on online promotions after cutting back in 2022 and part of 2023 over concerns about the Ukraine-Russian war and high interest rates.  But not all online ad companies are seeing the benefits. Snap shares cratered 35% on Wednesday after the company reported fourth-quarter sales growth of 5%, trailing expectations, and the company also issued weak guidance.  Prior to Thursday‚Äôs report, Pinterest shares were up 9.5% this year after surging 53% in 2023.  Costs dropped about 10% from a year ago to $785 million, largely due to a decline in sales and marketing expenses. A year ago Pinterest slashed about 5% of its workforce, part of a mass waive of job cuts across the tech industry.  Source:  2024-02-08 21:11:37]

Apple, the world's most valuable company, is projected to experience a 1.6% dip in total quarterly revenue, which would mark its sharpest decrease in third-quarter revenue since 2016, according to Refinitiv. Specifically, iPhone sales are anticipated to have declined by over 2% during this period, based on a survey of 24 analysts conducted by Visible Alpha. This contrasts with a nearly 3% increase in sales during the same quarter last year and a 1.5% rise in the preceding quarter (January-March).  The upcoming quarterly report may serve as a deviation from the positive earnings trend observed in other prominent tech companies such as Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Microsoft. These companies have demonstrated resilience in their cloud-based operations and have witnessed a surge in digital ad sales. "Apple is not immune to general macroeconomic trends and will continue to set the pace (for the smartphone industry) for quite some time," Reuters quoted Bob O'Donnell, founder of TECHnalysis Research, as saying. In September, analysts anticipate the unveiling of the much-anticipated iPhone 15, which could feature the widely accepted USB-C port on certain models. This development may provide a slight boost to iPhone sales during the July-September quarter, according to market experts, who have differing opinions on the overall performance during this period.  Notably, Apple has a tradition of not providing quarterly outlooks. However, industry analysts speculate that the tech giant might shed light on its utilisation of AI to enhance the upcoming product lineup, offering insights into the company's innovative approach.,;,; 2023-08-02 01:27:57]
[What Walmart‚Äôs ($WMT) stock split means for the Dow Jones.,;,; Walmart recently announced a 3 for 1 stock split, a significant move considering its status as a major component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Since the Dow is a price-weighted index, this split will decrease Walmart‚Äôs weighting in the index, initiating a rebalance to accommodate the drop in price.  It's intriguing to note that the Dow has been trailing behind the S&amp;P 500 in performance YTD, increasing ~2.6% and ~5.4% respectively.   Potentially prompting the index to consider adding new stocks to compensate for the YTD underperformance.  The last time the Dow underwent a significant change was in August 2020. At that time, Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell were added, while Exxon, Pfizer, and RTX Corp were removed.  Unlike their usual practices, the Dow committee has delayed making changes for an extended period of time, reminiscent of the period from June 2009 to September 2012.  With the Dow undergoing rebalancing, I‚Äôm eyeing potential exits for IBM, Cisco, Intel, Verizon, and Walgreens Boots Alliance.    Additionally, I could see potential additions like Amazon, META, and Eli Lilly who have a wider touch on the economy.  Which stocks do you predict might be on the way out, and which new additions do you foresee?,;,; 2024-02-09 15:03:06]
[Nvidia ($NVDA) is the best risk-reward short over the next few months,;,; On a technical-level, $NVDA is absolutely ridiculous. It's valuation is on-par with it's 2021 peak when the GPU shortage was at it's peak, and it's up almost 100% YTD with its inventories ballooning. Of course, trying to short a company just because it's over-valued or overbought is a fool's errand. You'll quickly find out that great stocks can simply keep going up for months on end. That's why you need a spark, or a narrative shift to get the ball rolling for the stock to reverse.    Fundamentally, $NVDA's enormous bounce has been attributed to Chat GPT and the recent AI movement. Just to be clear, I'm bullish on AI. (not $AI lol) However, up until now $NVDA's narrative has been that they will be the biggest, if not the sole, chip benefactor of the AI wave. Their A100 chip is the bread and butter for AI development while their H100 chip is the much beefier, enterprise-focused one. Don't get me wrong, the H100 is quite amazing and it's recent release will be hard to catch for some time. However, up until this point it's been thought that their lead in chips over AMD and Intel would grant them a large revenue boost over the next few years. Google's timely outperformance of the A100 is a testament that challengers are emerging. Nvidia's lead might end sooner than expected.  As we all know, once a technology trend catches on - the big tech players catch on and move quickly while deploying mountains of cash. Whether it's Apple, Microsoft, or Google - they will compete if the TAM is large enough. Whether it's Microsoft squishing out Zoom and Slack, or Apple ousting Intel CPU chips, or Google leveraging YouTube to compete against TikTok - these corporations do not hesitate to compete at any large opportunity.  I think tonight, the narrative has shifted for AI chips. I think we can all agree that big tech truly understands the dramatic paradigm shift that this AI wave will be. AI has been on the backburner for years up until Chat GPT recently proved that it's coming now. Therefore, would it be surprising that these corporations will try to develop their AI-chips in-house? Apple did it for their CPUs in their macs, thanks to TSMC. If Nvidia controlled and manufactured its own fabs then this discussion would be irrelevant. But that's not the case. Google has apparently already caught up to the A100 with their chip designs. What about Apple or Microsoft? You think they're content with continuing to dump fortunes on Nvidia chips if AI is the future? Of course they're going to develop their own chips in house as well. Hardware is key. That's been a turning point for Meta, and is a large reason they're trying to make VR work. You need to control both the hardware and the software.  tl;dr: OTM Puts on $NVDA for May or June 2023. Expect a 20-30% drop in the coming weeks.,;,; 2023-04-05 03:23:15]
[Zoominfo: Q4 Results and Dampened 2023 Outlook. Is Management being Conservative?,;,; Zoominfo (ZI -1.43%‚Üì) Q4 2022 revenue topped $300mn and registered an annual growth rate of 36%. Adjusted operating income margins exceeded 40%, which puts Zoominfo in a rare category of meaningful profitability among higher-growth technology companies. But the key issue with last evening‚Äôs financial report had to do with its outlook: 2023 is only projected to grow at high teens. Not bad for any company to be forecasting double digit growth in a recessionary environment, but expectations for Zoominfo had been higher, especially in the light of historical performance.  &amp;#x200B;  Key Highlights from Q4 2022 Report  The technology sector has been laying off employees since early-to-mid 2022 to reduce overheads and prepare for potentially weaker business volumes. Even giants like Salesforce (CRM -2.15%‚Üì) and Meta (META -2.25%‚Üì) could not avoid the fate as recessionary pressures continued unabated and markets demanded to see higher profitability.  &amp;#x200B;  With 40% of its customer base originating from the software vertical and a largely seat-base revenue model, Zoominfo faced increasingly stacked odds in 2022. While it had enjoyed extraordinary growth in tandem with prevalent hiring in the technology sector back in 2021, those tailwinds recently turned into headwinds. Trying to retain accounts and win new ones when customers (exiting and potential) were retrenching became a tall order.,;,; 2023-03-10 00:13:40]
[Google parent Alphabet‚Äôs stock hit with two downgrades this week,;,; In his research note, Shmulik said Alphabet‚Äôs ‚Äúnarrative has caught up with the fundamentals.‚Äù In other words, the stock is priced to match the company‚Äôs current performance and outlook. He also raised concerns about the way market sentiment went negative on the company after OpenAI announced ChatGPT in Nov. 2022 only to turn positive when the tech titan debuted its own generative AI software in May.        ‚ÄúWhat do we imagine would happen then, in any of the next 2-4 quarters, if Google Search numbers were to come in 'soft'? We imagine investors may once again ring the alarm bells around AI-related risks to Google's Search moat,‚Äù Shmulik wrote.  The analysts also pointed to Google‚Äôs Search Generative Experience (SGE) as a potential headwind for the company‚Äôs search advertising business. SGE is Google‚Äôs experimental generative AI-powered search platform. Like Microsoft‚Äôs Bing, it uses generative AI to provide users with answers to specific queries. The problem, the analysts say, is that the generative AI responses occupy screen space that is currently used to serve ads on the normal Google Search page.  ‚ÄúWe recognize that \[Google‚Äôs\] SGE roll-out is still in its very early stages (limited beta in the US only), with the integration of ads still being figured out,‚Äù Walmsley wrote in a research note. ‚ÄúBut our initial testing of SGE shows material changes to \[search engine results page\] vs. the ‚Äòold‚Äô Google‚Ä¶which we see as demonstrative of the potential disruption to Google's well-oiled Search monetization machine.‚Äù        Google is also increasingly facing challenges from the likes of Meta and Amazon in the digital advertising space. TikTok is also quickly playing a larger role in the industry. Increased spending on generative AI technologies could also cut into Alphabet‚Äôs margins.        The company is also staring down a slew of regulatory challenges including calls by the European Union‚Äôs European Commission to break up Google‚Äôs massive advertising business, which the commission says violates antitrust laws.,;,; 2023-06-28 10:09:27]
[These Are The Best (And Worst) Performing Stocks Of 2023,;,;  Driving stocks‚Äô broad rebound over the first seven weeks of the year are several of last year‚Äôs black sheep, including Tesla, the always volatile electric vehicle company helmed by the U.S.‚Äô second-richest man Elon Musk.  &amp;#x200B;   Tesla is the best-performing stock listed on the S&amp;P 500 year-to-date, rising 69%, while the other five best-performing S&amp;P constituents are streamer Warner Bros. Discovery (up 63%), biotechnology contractor Catalent (59%), orthodontics firm Align Technology (50%) and the cruise liner Royal Caribbean (48%), according to FactSet data.  Despite spanning industries, each of those companies have one thing in common: They were among the worst-performing stocks of 2022, each losing 35% or more last year.  Other notable gainers this year are fellow streamers Paramount (40%) and Disney (21%), Silicon Valley technology giants Nvidia (46%) and Meta (44%) and other leisure travel stocks like Norwegian Cruise Line (44%) and Caesars Entertainment (27%).     The S&amp;P‚Äôs biggest losers are also a diverse group, led by telecommunications firm Lumen Technologies (-25%) and followed by solar energy company Enphase Energy (-23%), specialty healthcare provider Baxter International (-20%), energy company APA Corp (-18%) and pharmaceutical and healthcare giant Pfizer (-15%).  The decline of Pfizer, by far the worst-performing stock of 2023 with a market capitalization over $100 billion, comes after the company [said]( it expected sales for its Covid-19 vaccine and oral treatment will slip 60% in 2023, and headline an onslaught for several big pharmaceutical companies, with peers Johnson &amp; Johnson and Eli Lilly down 9% and 10%, respectively, year-to-date.     KEY BACKGROUND  The S&amp;P 500 is up 6.7% year-to-date after slipping 18% in 2022, its worst annual performance since 2008. The slump closely tracked the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates from around 0% to over 4% in an effort to slow inflation. In addition to Meta, other mega-cap tech stocks are up dramatically this year, with each of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft up 6% or more.  ## TANGENT  Also gaining thus far in 2023 is bitcoin, up almost 50% year-to-date at about $25,000, an eight-month high. Oanda analyst Craig Erlam warned Monday that investors must be wary of the latest rally for the cryptocurrency, explaining: ‚ÄúWe've all seen what happens when enthusiasm and euphoria exist in cryptos,‚Äù referring to bitcoin‚Äôs dramatic 75% nosedive between November 2021 and November 2022.  ## SURPRISING FACT  U.S. military contractor Northrop Grumman is the sixth-worst performing S&amp;P constituent year-to-date, [despite]( a recent rally for it and other defense stocks as geopolitical tensions stewed.  ## BIG NUMBER  $61.3 billion. That‚Äôs how much Musk has tacked onto his fortune so far this year during Tesla‚Äôs rally, roughly the size of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs total fortune. Musk, who lost his position as the world‚Äôs wealthiest person in December, is $15 billion away from reclaiming the title from LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault.  ##,;,; 2023-02-21 06:30:02]

They're human, they want to do enjoyable things, nothing inherently wrong with that.  Just interested to see if this is something people consider when investing in companies that have become a cult of personality around a specific person.,;,; 2023-06-03 18:29:45]
[Google commits to invest $2 billion in OpenAI competitor Anthropic,;,; Google agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic, the artificial intelligence startup founded by ex-OpenAI executives, CNBC has confirmed. The commitment involves a $500 million upfront cash infusion and an additional $1.5 billion to be invested over time, an Anthropic spokesperson told CNBC. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the planned financing. A Google spokesperson didn‚Äôt immediately respond to request for comment.  Anthropic is the developer of Claude 2, a rival chatbot to OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT that‚Äôs used by companies including Slack, Notion and Quora. The company was founded in 2021 and, in addition to Google, has received funding from Salesforce and Zoom and was valued earlier this year at $4.1 billion. Claude 2 has the ability to summarize up to about 75,000 words, which could be the length of a book. Users can input large data sets and ask for summaries in the form of a memo, letter or story. ChatGPT, by contrast, can handle about 3,000 words.  Research by Arthur AI, a machine learning monitoring platform, found Claude 2 to be most reliable chatbot in terms of ‚Äúself-awareness,‚Äù meaning accurately gauging what it does and doesn‚Äôt know, and answering only questions it had training data to support. Arthur AI tested chatbots from Meta, Cohere and OpenAI.  In April, Google invested $300 million in the company, taking a 10% stake. That same month, Anthropic was one of four companies invited to a meeting at the White House to discuss responsible AI development with Vice President Kamala Harris. Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and OpenAI were the others.  Anthropic quickly turned around and raised a $450 million round in May. At the time, it marked the largest funding round for an AI company since Microsoft‚Äôs investment in OpenAI in January, according to PitchBook data.Anthropic was founded by Dario Amodei, OpenAI‚Äôs former vice president of research, and his sister, Daniela Amodei, who was OpenAI‚Äôs vice president of safety and policy. Several other OpenAI research alumni were also on Anthropic‚Äôs founding team.  Amodei told CNBC in July that Anthropic invested at least two months in developing its newest chatbot, with a team of 30 to 35 people working directly on the AI model and a total of 150 people supporting it. She said the market is growing so rapidly that there‚Äôs plenty of room for multiple players to succeed.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a really unusual time from a business perspective because there‚Äôs just so much demand for large language models and really more demand than the industry can currently provide,‚Äù Amodei said at the time. ‚ÄúThe landscape is just very wide, and there‚Äôs really quite a lot of room for many different users and types of users to make use of these systems.‚Äù   2023-10-28 08:01:16]
[Adobe and Figma call off $20 billion merger,;,; Adobe and Figma, the cloud-based design tool, will terminate their planned $20 billion merger in light of regulatory hurdles, the companies said Monday.  In a statement, the two companies said "there is no clear path to receive necessary regulatory approvals from the European Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority."  Adobe shares rose around 1.8% on the news in pre-market trading Monday.  "Adobe and Figma strongly disagree with the recent regulatory findings, but we believe it is in our respective best interests to move forward independently," Shantanu Narayen, CEO of Adobe, wrote in a statement. "While Adobe and Figma shared a vision to jointly redefine the future of creativity and productivity, we continue to be well positioned to capitalize on our massive market opportunity and mission to change the world through personalized digital experiences."  Adobe will pay Figma a $1 billion breakup fee, Adobe said in a regulatory filing.  The news is a sudden pivot from Narayen's latest talking points, as he told CNBC Wednesday that the company believes in the acquisition and its benefits for consumers.  "We want to take the ability for what Figma has done with respect to creative collaborative software on the web, combine that with what Adobe has done in our creative, and make it even more accessible for others," Narayen told CNBC's Jim Cramer. "We think it's an adjacency, we really believe in our merits of the case, but the regulatory environment is challenging."  Antitrust regulators have increasingly scrutinized numerous tech deals big and small. In May, after the U.K.'s competition watchdog cited potentially anti-competitive effects, Meta sold Giphy to photo marketplace Shutterstock for $53 million, three years after it first acquired it. The CMA has also been reviewing Microsoft's investment in OpenAI.  In Monday's joint statement, Figma CEO Dylan Field wrote that "going through this process with Shantanu, David and the Adobe team has only reinforced my belief in the merits of this deal, but it's become increasingly clear over the past few months that regulators don't see things the same way."    2023-12-18 13:49:11]

[Proof you need to predict the future to be successful,;,; Any trade is defined by 3 dimensions: entry price + duration + exit price. The duration is the risk management aspect i.e if after it elapsed we exit regardless the exit price. And try again.  Any trade a trader enters is based on the assumption the trade will yield a profit =, say of x. No one enters a trade to hope losing money after all :)  Assuming a probability of x above, the trader will realize a number of trades hoping the majority will result in a PROFIT.  BUT whether we have a single trade or many, all of them can be quantified by a single meta-trade consolidating an entry price, a duration and an exit price.  Basically if we call t1... tn a series of trades... then all of them can be summarized by a single triple of (entry price, exit price) which averages all of them.(t1,...,tn) = (entry, duration, exit)  Get it? Regardless of anything everything a trader or algo trader does can ultimately be summarized by the entry price, a duration and exit price.  In fact all of Warren Buffets' career can be summarized by those 3 variable. Of course the average of the entry price is consolidated over decades as is duration and exit price and the capital involved massive.  But per the reduction above, and mathematically, the critical value becomes exit price which is after a duration in the future. Hence predicting it accurately is the only way to ever trade successfully.  Any trading system will need to predict that future value. There is no escaping it.  ANY STRATEGY, ANY METHOD, ANYTHING can ultimately be converted to the 3 values that define a trade. There is a 1-1 conversion ratio.,;,; 2023-12-06 20:20:03]

Am I better off just throwing all of these funds in an index fund like that? Realistically the chances of these stocks beating the overall market seem to be slim. Pardon my ignorance if this is an obvious question!

[Interest Rate Resistant Sector Specific Inflation,;,; Is the market still pricing in rate cuts as stocks go to record highs?   Are non stock comp workers primed to demand pay increases, as their companies pull in massive profits, and as personal costs continue to heighten?   As stock comped workers continue to accrue more wealth, and lower class continues to take on debt (inc. non forgivable student debt), has there ever been more of a pronounced have and have-not gap?  Will large companies continue to dominate their industry space? Has industry ever been as consolidated as it is today? How many wealthy people do you hear about working for smaller companies? How many smaller companies are left with acquisition and consolidation happening all the time?  Are raised interest rates having any effect on aforementioned large, industry consolidated companies with huge profit margins? As when you own a large slice of the market for essential goods, you can simply raise prices, and they will be paid. Biden admin recently addressed this for the grocery corps. But grocery, shipping, and producers have heavily consolidated in recent years, as have most industries.  With the recent progress of tech, there is big efficiencies gained by industry consolidation. See amazon. But those industries also attain market, employment and regulatory control with their resources. And jobs continue to be "de-skilled" by efficiency and automation, which is used as a reason to keep pay low.   I'm not sure what this all means for the economy or the market. I've been telling everyone for years that it's a strange but incredibly bustling time for US hegemony in the world. I should have believed my own thought in terms of the market. But I tend to skew overly pragmatic.   I did pretty well recently, as my 200 share short @ 230 on Tesla finally started to pay off. It seems like the AI hype is a ticking time bomb. But tech companies like meta are making so much money they can throw billions into speculation plays without a worry. They seem to actually have no choice but to do this.

[Amazon stock analysis: Why it's my only holding in my portfolio,;,; I'm more bullish on Amazon today than I was two days ago. Even though their stock price has increased by 6% in after markets. I think Amazon is valued less today than before their earnings. Their earnings were that good. I'll share with you my thoughts on Amazon and why my investing portfolio will change form 80% Amazon and 20% Google to 100% Amazon the second the market opens.  Let's have a look at all their revenue streams very briefly.  AWS. Cloud computing. In the words of Andy Jassy: a technology that will change businesses around the world with the same amount of impact the invention of electricity had on businesses. Businesses are only just now starting to adopt. We are still early in the early phases of cloud computing. AWS hit 90 billion in sales this year. And their last two quarters AWS had an operating income of 30%. AWS is getting more reasons to adopt and more reasons to increase spending by their customers due to the many AI solutions it offers to companies. It's safe to say AWS will hit 100 billion in revenue next year and that this will bring in around 30 billion in operating income. Many people are scared that AWS will have their customers stolen by Azure. Firstly, 90% of the cloud engineers I talk to, prefer AWS. Secondly, it costs a ton of money to set up cloud infrastructure for businesses. Why would they throw all their money away and spend this once again to make a switch to a different cloud provider. The majority of the current customers Amazon has aren't going anywhere. You can basically look at it as a subscription. Lastly on AWS, AWS has 6 times more server capacity than the next 12 competitors combined.  Advertising. Many people tend to forget how big Amazon advertising is. It generated $47 billion in the last twelve months and it's growing at 27% year on year. That means if there are 3 more years of 25% growth we are nearing an other nearly 100 billion revenue stream. And although we don't know their margins on advertising we know nearly certainly that it's generating higher profit margins than Meta or Google due to the fact that Amazon advertising is way more targeted. Oh you're looking at Amazon.com to buy a BBQ? Here's and advertisement of a BBQ. The cost per click on those type of ads will be very high.  Warehouse and logistics. This is the least sexy side of the business, but because of the amount of revenue it's still up there potential wise. Amazon online stores and third party sellers generated $410 billion in revenue in 2023. Amazon is the leader in logistics robotics. This has not only been told by Amazon, but this was dropped in the FedEx earnings call a few quarters back. Amazon is the company that will offer the best solutions as of now. They will most likely first fulfill their own needs and afterwards export their robotics to other parties for profit although now we are getting way ahead of ourselves as Amazon still hasn't impacted their own margins. Fulfillment cost used to hover around 27% of the product sales in 2020. After Covid, Amazon invested heavily in infrastructure for logistics. This increases maintenance and the need of personnel. Also they grew too much and too fast decreasing their margins. Their fulfillment cost was 31% of product sales in 2021, 35% in 2022 peaking at 37% in Q1 2023 and now ending Q4 2023 at 34% averaging once again 35% of the net product sales being the cost of fulfillment for the full year of 2023. But we see a decrease. Amazon went from 37% in Q1 2023 to now 34% in Q4 2023. This may not seem like a lot but when we are talking about such big numbers that this has significant impact. If Amazon would get their total fulfillment cost percentage compared to net product sales down to 33% for a full year this would leave Amazon with an extra 6 billion operating income. If Amazon would get the percentage down to 30% this would mean $13.5 billion more operating income than FY2023. If Amazon would get back to their previous 27%. This would mean a total of $21 billion more operating income. And keeping their current price to operating cash flow of 20 in mind (which is low compared to the historic mean of 27) an increase of $21 billion in a year means an increase of $420 billion in market cap. Keeping automation in mind I think they should have little trouble getting back to their old percentage of 27% in the next three to five years.  Amazon Prime, now the majority of prime members are coming from the US, Europe is only just now receiving prime content from their own country and advertisements to subscribe to prime. I'm located in the Netherlands we had a company that is comparable to Amazon for online products for here and Belgium way before Amazon arrived here. Amazon has been in the Netherlands since 2014 but they are just now completely blowing the competitor out of the water. Since one year me and many others are only using Amazon and now we are seeing ads to subscribe to prime. Subscribing to prime is only valuable if you actually make use of the logistics side of things. But it helps if prime has other things to offer as well. That's where we get to my next point. Prime video is partnering up with lots of famous people here to make Prime content. And the content isn't bad at all. That prime content hasn't even been rolling out for 6 months. Prime is just in its infancy for many countries it has recently moved into. Like I said Amazon is here since 2014 but only now I'm seeing Dutch shows on Amazon prime and having lots of people ask me to share my prime account with them. I'm sure the Netherlands wont be alone in this, it will be all the other countries as well. And guess what Amazon prime just received an additional big revenue stream, advertising. All users will receive advertisements unless they pay a few dollars a month to not see ads. Netflix earns more per subscriber that's on the cheaper subscription with ads than it does on the more expensive subscription without ads.  Additionally Amazon International gets even less love. Understandable though it's less revenue and barley sees a positive quarter. But what people forget is that it took Amazon US 10 years to turn profitable. So why do we think that International will be any faster, especially considering there is less infrastructure in countries outside of the US. I'd say we might need to wait 15 years for those countries to start making a profit. So which countries have been operational for longer than 15 years? The United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, China and Canada. Which countries have been operational for less than 15 years? Italy, Spain, Brazil, India, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore, Australia, Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Poland, Egypt and Belgium. We don't only need time for Amazon to build out the infrastructure. The middleclass in many of these countries is still growing which will increase activity in buying. And lastly, we need to give Amazon time to make Amazon prime subscription a valuable subscription in these countries by adding local content to Prime Video.  Amazon infrastructure, like I previously mentioned AWS has 6 times the server capacity compared to the next 12 competitors. Amazon is spending by far the most on renewable energy sources. They spent $2.5 billion on renewable energy, all to power their delivery vans and their servers. Although it may not seem huge but generating their in house electricity is bound to save them billions in the long run. Also Amazon is making their own chips for their AWS servers, they don't depend on a different party to be able to deliver. This in turn also increases their margins.  Lastly, Amazon is not sitting still. They have Amazon Gaming, Project Kuiper which has 3.000 satellites in orbit, they are making a plan to revolutionize the healthcare system and make it more cost and time efficient. They say in their call that they are still investing money to look for the next big pillar of Amazon, something that will be as big as AWS, advertising or Prime. They're not sitting still.  Okay story wise, I might have convinced you by now. But you could say, this is all a bunch of promising words. What about their valuation? Due to the fact Amazon invests a lot of their cash flow Amazon has usually been valued based on their price to operating cash flow. If we take the current after market price of Amazon of $169. Their current price to operating cash flow is at 20.6. This is 15% lower than what it was 2 days ago and this is 35% lower compared to their historical median price to operating cash flow of 27. Now this doesn't per se have to mean they will ever get back to that median price to operating cash flow so lets look at some different valuation methods. Remember Paypal was attractive to many people because it was "only at a PE of 30" instead of the usual 60. So lets keep on looking.  In Q4 of 2023 alone Amazon produced $30 billion free cash flow. Now Q4 is always a record quarter so we can't multiply this by 4. Q3 of 2023 Amazon had a free cash flow of $10 billion. This was still a quarter where many of their cost saving initiatives hadn't yet fully come to fruition, so although it was a much better quarter than Q2 which generated 6 billion in free cash flow. I'm very certain that Q3 free cash flow will be more in line with upcoming quarter. If we multiply 10 billion by 3 and 30 billion once. That's a free cash flow of 60 billion. This would be their free cash flow in 2024 if they don't grow, don't further increase margins and don't continue to lessen their investing of cash flow. If we take a quite reasonable (in my opinion) price to free cash flow of 30 times we see that Amazon stock should be valued at 1800 billion market cap. That's pretty much where the marketcap is at right now. Although I'm a firm believer that Amazon will grow in 2024. Let's not forget they are giving all their prime members ads from now on, or the ability to pay more for no ads. This alone will generate around 2 billion free cash flow in my estimation. Other than that I'm expecting Amazon to grow it's already existing revenue streams further, increase its margin further and decrease CAPEX. Which should result in record free cash flow in 2024. I'm estimating 12 billion in Q1, 13 billion in Q2, 15 billion in Q3 and 38 billion in Q4. Now I would love to tell you that these estimations are highly calculated by me and a pack of mathematicians. But I'll have to disappoint you and say that it's not. I've been doing estimates on Amazon every quarter based on the trends I see in the numbers and the story I pair with it. I have been quite spot on with the numbers so far. If my estimation would be reasonably close it would mean a market cap of 2.340 trillion, an increase of 34% at a price to free cash flow of 30 or an increase to a market cap of 2.730, an increase of 57% at a price to free cash flow of 35. Do note Microsoft is valued at 40 times price to free cash flow. And although I think Amazon and Microsoft should be valued similarly I find it hard to justify a price to free cash flow of 40 or more if you're not growing cash flow above 20% YoY.  We could also disassemble the components of Amazon and value these components with the price to sales of a company that offers similar services. To some people this might be a bit more hocus-pocus but I like doing this to see where Amazon stands in the market compared to other stocks. I'm using price to sales in this example because sadly we do not know the operating income on Amazon advertising and on Amazon Prime.  AWS had a total sales in FY 2023 of $90 billion. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Microsoft of 13 times. Resulting in AWS having a marketcap of $1,170 billion.  Amazon advertising has a total sales in FY 2023 of $47 billion. Lets get the average price to sales of two companies for this one. Google of 6 times price to sales and Meta of 8 times. Thus we multiply by 7. Resulting in Amazon advertising having a marketcap of $329 billion. Even though Amazon advertising has higher margins and is growing faster than Google and Meta.  Next up Amazon Prime had a total sales of $40 billion in FY 2023. Lets pair this with the price to sales of Netflix of 7.5. Resulting in Amazon Prime having a marketcap of $300 billion.  Lastly Amazon online stores, physical stores and logistics services offered to third party sellers generated a total revenue of 392$ billion in FY 2023. Lets take a price to sales of 0.70 based on the price to sales of Walmart at 0.71 and the price to sales of FedEx at 0.69. Resulting in a market cap of $274 billion dollars.  If we calculate all the components together we have a total market cap from Amazon of 2.073 trillion. An increase of 18.5% form the current prices. And this is based on historic number, not forward looking. Similarly when using the price to operating cash flow Amazon had two days ago of 23 we see that Amazon's stock is valued at a 15% cheaper price now than just two days ago. Supporting the argument that Amazon is more less 15% undervalued based on current prices, not forward looking expectations. This is why I moved my Google position into Amazon. As Google is looking undervalued by 15% on forward looking prices, but Amazon is looking undervalued by the same amount based on historic prices. Meaning if we expect Amazon to do slightly better in the future Amazon is a better buy than Google.  TLDR: I think Amazon is undervalued by 15% based on historic numbers. Forward looking though, I expect Amazon to be more less undervalued by around 30% - 50% based on end of on end of FY 2024 numbers. This is based on how well they execute increasing their margins, decreasing CAPEX and continuing their business trends growth wise.,;,; 2024-02-02 11:25:46]

[A Deep Dive on PayPal: Is it a good time to Buy? [DD],;,; A couple of years ago, PayPal was all the hype. Today, the stock is down 75% from its all-time high. Once a growth stock, PayPal is now moving towards value stock territory. The big question here is this. Is PayPal worth buying right now? Is it a bargain or is it a value trap?  # Operations  First of all, let's look at PayPal's operations. PayPal's main source of revenue are the fees that PayPal charges for completing transactions and other payment-related services. Other revenue sources include foreign currency conversion fees and also fees for purchasing or selling cryptocurrencies. As such, PayPal's business model is based on the volume of transactions. The more transactions, the more fees the company gets. In 2022, users, transactions and payment volume on PayPal increased.   * 2% increase in users to 435 million with 8.6 million new net accounts added   Out of these, 400 million were consumer active accounts and 35 million were active merchant accounts * 16% increase in number of transactions to 22.3 billion * 9% total payment volume increase to $1.36 trillion on a spot basis so basically without adjusting for any forex changes.  The family of PayPal brands includes Braintree, Chargehound, Honey, Venmo and others so the company has a very strong brand presence. I keep seeing an ad for Honey almost every single day, I think the other brands are more US-focused (I'm UK-based), but the gist of it is that PayPal is becoming more popular, more established. [Recently, PayPal added more features to its payment solutions for small businesses.]( The main change was increasing the range of payment options for customers by including Apple Pay along with saving payment options and others.   # Competition  When it comes to mobile payments, PayPal competes with the likes of Google Pay, Cash App, Zelle, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Venmo although Venmo is actually owned by PayPal. They all have some pros and cons. However, PayPal appears to have the best international payment support. PayPal owns Xoom which allows users to send payments to users in 131 countries without the recipient needing an app or a smartphone. The recipient can just pick up the payment at their local bank. PayPal also allows you to send money to people in over 200 countries worldwide as long as they also have the app. PayPal is also ahead of the competition when it comes to web and website payments since you can complete the payment by using any web browser. Doesn't matter if it's Firefox, Chrome or Safari. However, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay can be used with smart watches which are becoming more and more popular.  ***US market***   In fact, this may be one of the reasons why Apple Pay is the most widely used mobile payment service in the US. 43.9 million people report using it at least once followed by Starbucks with 31.2 million. Yes, Starbucks, I know, I'm surprised as well, but it seems to be a popular method of payment in the US. Google Pay follows with 25 million users and Samsung Pay with 16.3 million users. Again, this is in the US.  ***Worldwide***   In terms of total mobile payment users worldwide, you have AliPay and WeChat Pay with 650 and 500 million users respectively, followed by Apple Pay with 507 million, Google Pay with 421 million and PayPal with 377 million. Venmo has 52 million, but it counted separately. If you combine the two since Paypal owns Venmo, Paypal comes ahead of Google Pay with 429 million users. Plus, AliPay and WeChat Pay are pretty much the status quo in China, but they are not that big outside of China. In fact, I'm not sure you can get them outside of China unless you are a Chinese national. Essentially, Google Pay, Apple Pay and Paypal are the big international names. Now, Google and Apple have a big advantage because they obviously produce their own phones, they have iOS and Android and they pretty much come with built-in Apple and Google Pay. They also have the smart watches which integrate with these payment apps.   ***Total Payment Volume competition***   Now, it would be really good if we could see the official total payment volume through these apps and compare it with Paypal. It could be the case where because the payment apps are installed by default, it seems they have a large userbase, but in reality users don't use them as much as Paypal or they just use them for small purchases. [The closest stats I could find were in this article here]( The author claims that Apple Pay has a total transaction volume of $6 trillion whereas Google Pay had $2.5 trillion. However, these are not official statistics by either of these companies. There are also disagreements over what exactly constitutes an Apple Pay or Google Pay transaction. In most cases, people don't pay with the apps, they just use the wallet option to pay with their actual card instead of paying with the digital payment app. Again, we don't know the exact transaction volume and we can just speculate, but we can see why Apple and Google Pay are massive competitors to Paypal. Still, the good thing is that the market for mobile payment apps is growing fast worldwide. There are a lot more users left to capture and Paypal is in a good position to do that as one of the leading payment apps, but enough about operations.  # Financials metrics  We know Paypal is big and we know it's not going anywhere. The company is a viable competitor to Google and Apple, but what are the financials of Paypal? Are they profitable? Are they efficient? What's the case here?  To answer these questions, I will look at Paypal's current and historical metrics and compare them to the company's peers in the Transaction and Payment Processing sector in the US. Quick note on the sector metrics. This sector is dominated by Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Fiserv, Block and Fidelity National Information Services. These 6 companies make up 77% of the total revenue in this sector. Meanwhile, 18 of the 35 companies in the sector are losing money. Basically, take the sector data with some hint of salt. I want to provide some comparison for Paypal, but at the same time we have a duopoly of Visa and Mastercard at the top and a lot of new players at the bottom.  Okay, so lets look at profitability. Paypal has a:  * gross profit margin of 42.35% which is below its 5-year average of 45.79% and the sector median of 47.32% * net income margin of 8.79% is also below its 5-year average of 14.58%, but above the sector median of 0.57% * levered free cash flow margin stands at 12.1% compared to its 5-year average of 14.58% and the sector median of 4.73% * Return on Equity is decent at 11.5% compared to the 5-year average of 16.7% and the sector median of 11.05%  Overall, Paypal is doing well. Their metrics have declined over the last few years which is worrying, but the change has not been that drastic \[yet\]. It's good to monitor these metrics of course because this could turn into a red flag if the trend continues.  # Analyst Expectations  Despite the above, analysts are expecting a steady growth in earnings per share over the next few years. The consensus is:  * 18.33% in 2023 * 15.28% in 2024 * 13.07% in 2025  In fact, analysts have recently started revising their expectations up which is a good sign. Basically, the sentiment towards Paypal is improving after a year and a half of declining expectations. This type of expectations change often leads to a reversal in stock price so this is one reason why I am turning bullish on Paypal.  Paypal has historically shown really good growth in revenue and earnings. Their compounded annual revenue growth is 17% since 2013 with their revenue going from $6,727 billion in 2013 to $27,518 billion in 2022. Their compounded annual earnings growth is 10.9% with earnings growing from $955 million in 2013 to $2.42 billion in 2022. By the looks of it, this type of growth can be sustained for at least another few years.  # Valuation  This is really, really good, mainly because the stock has lately been priced as a value stock. Paypal has:  * adjusted PE ratio of 18.15 compared to the 5-year average of 41.72. * adjusted forward PE ratio of 15.34 compared to the 5-year average of 37.94 * price-to-earnings growth ratio of only 1.1 compared to the 5-year average of 2 * relatively low forward price-to-book of 3.74 compared to the 5-year average of 8.1 * forward price-to-cash-flow of 11.84 compared to their 5-year average of 27.4  The way I see it, there are 2 reasons for the low valuation.  One, Paypal had a massively inflated stock price in 2021. Typically, you see a corresponding massive drop in price after this type of jump in valuation. Overreaction in one direction leads to overreaction in the opposite direction, a bit like a pendulum. This creates an amazing buying opportunity and I think we are seeing this right now.  The second reason for the low valuation could be that investors have different expectations to analysts. Even though the analysts expect a steady growth in earnings and profits, maybe investors don't see it that that way. Maybe there are some risk factors that analysts are overlooking. That's valid. Looking at Paypal's annual report, we can see a lot of factors that the company identifies. Cybersecurity is a crucial one, increasing competition is another. You also have legislation and compliance risk, you have risk to do with credit, third parties and so on. A lot of these are just regular day-to-day business threats that a financial processing company faces.  The main risk in my eyes is the increasing competition from Google and Apple. However, Paypal has some advantage there because it is mainly a financial company. Google and Apple have other more important business units and I think that Google Pay and Apple Pay are not as important to these companies as their core businesses. In comparison, payments and transactions are Paypal's core business. Cryptocurrency is also a growing risk, but I don't think it poses that big of a threat to Paypal right now. Maybe in 5 years or so. However, Paypal has been active in allowing users to buy, sell and transfer cryptocurrencies. Plus, users can actually use Paypal to pay in crypto although there are improvements that can be made there.  # Conclusion  Overall, I think that **we currently have a good bullish argument for Paypal**. The valuation is really cheap. We are seeing some of the lowest prices since December 2018. Even the company itself has committed to buying back a lot of shares because of the cheap price. In 2022, Paypal bought back $4.2 billion worth of shares or about 80% of their free cash flow. The management has said that they think share buybacks are an excellent way to spend their capital and I agree. They estimate that 75% of the free cash flow in 2023 will go towards share repurchases. In my opinion, this will create bullish pressure for the company. It will reduce the floating stock, it will increase ownership for existing shareholders and it will boost metrics. In terms of target price, the analyst consensus right now is $103.4 dollars or about a 38% upside on the current price of $75. I think that's a reasonable target for the next 12 to 18 months.  What do you think? Is Paypal a good purchase right now? Have I missed any important details about their business?,;,; 2023-04-10 10:43:24]

["Is the AI-led 'F*cking Baby Bubble' Bursting? BofA Says Tech Stocks Just Saw Their Biggest Outflow in 10 Weeks.",;,; The current AI-led "baby bubble" could be seen as a positive or a negative depending on the perspective. On the one hand, it is a sign of progress and innovation, with technology giants such as Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla leading the way. The stock prices of these companies have boomed this year, suggesting that investors are bullish on the future of AI.  On the other hand, there are some who are warning that the investor hype for AI could be short-lived and that the market could be heading for a significant correction. Bank of America's Michael Hartnett has compared the current AI boom to the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s, where the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 78%. UBS's Art Cashin and veteran economist David Rosenberg have also drawn parallels with the dot-com bubble.  Ultimately, it is difficult to know for sure whether the AI-led "baby bubble" will burst or if it will continue to grow and drive the stock market higher. It is important to remember that, while AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, it is still a relatively new technology and there is a lot of uncertainty and risk associated with investing in AI-related stocks. As such, it is important for investors to do their due diligence and be aware of the potential downsides before investing in AI stocks.

That‚Äôs particularly the case if stocks get a boost in January ‚Äî like they often do ‚Äî following tax-loss harvesting in December.*  *For the skittish camp, the latest signals from the Fed are a source of angst.*  *Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested last week that the central bank wasn‚Äôt about to lower rates anytime soon, and that was before Friday‚Äôs blockbuster jobs report. After that data, swaps traders chopped the probability of a March rate cut to around 20%, and no longer see a May reduction as a done deal.*  *For some would-be dip-buyers, that raises red flags, especially with the latest Deutsche Bank AG data showing that aggregate equity positioning among rules-based and discretionary funds is in the top quarter of observations going back to 2010.

[Return On Equity,;,; Hey, I wanted to share my thoughts on a financial metric: Return On Equity. Return on equity calculation is: *Net income/Shareholders Equity.* **I believe Return on Equity is useful, however it can mislead investors if you do not understand its limits. Return On Invested Capital (ROIC) is better for assessing earning power.**  For example, if company A generates $20,000 in income and has $100,000 in equity, then return on equity is 20%. If company B generates $20,000 in income and has $200,000 in equity, then return on equity is 10%. Based on the above example, Company A is more efficient and requires fewer capital to generate the same profit as Company B.  *However...*  *COMPANY A BALANCE SHEET*  |**Assets**|$1,000,000| |:-|:-| |**Liabilities**|$900,000|  For Company A, If we add assets and subtract it by liabilities: Equity is $100,000. However, liabilities represent 90% of total assets (*$900,000/$100,000).* Debt to Equity ratio would be: **9.**  *COMPANY B BALANCE SHEET*  |**Assets**|$300,000| |:-|:-| |**Liabilities**|$100,000|  For company B, if we add assets and subtract it by liabilities: Equity is $200,000. However, liabilities only represent 33% of total assets *($100,000/$200,000).* Debt to Equity ratio would be **0.5.**  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  This explains why companies like Caterpillar (42% ROE) appears more profitable than Alphabet (23%). Or Nordstrom (33% ROE) compared with META (18%). ROE is higher for the former two not because they have more earning power, but because they are far more leveraged *(carry more debt).*  **Conclusion:**  Make sure you are checking the health of a company's balance sheet before comparing ROE between two companies in the same industry. This is why I think ROE is overrated and prefer to use ROIC instead.,;,; 2023-09-03 11:59:21]

The beaten-down bank jumped 21.9%, a day after losing 47%. The SPDR Regional Banking ETF (KRE) gained 3%.

[Should I buy different ETFs depending on the type of account? IRA account vs. Individual Investment account.,;,; My mother recently passed away, and I inherited two Fidelity accounts that she had. One of the accounts was her IRA account. The other was an individual investment account. After taking a look at both of them, I realized that she has a ton of money in bonds. This made sense for someone her age, but for me, I'd like to completely revamp these accounts since I'm 32 years with a much higher risk tolerance.    She also has a ton of different individual stocks (over 70 different individual stocks) that I'd like to consolidate and use mostly ETFs instead. I will post my portfolio plan of action below. My main question is, should I be focusing mainly on ETFs that are dividend driven for the IRA account? While focusing mainly on non-dividend ETFs for my investment account? I know that with IRA accounts, you do not get taxed on dividends as yearly income like you would for investment accounts. I plan on buying the following ETFs for my investment account.   50% VOO (ETF)- Vanguard 500 Index Fund - 500 largest companies.  15% VTI (ETF)- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund - Overall stock market.  10% AVUV (ETF)- Avantis US Small Cap Value -  US small-cap.  10% QQQ (ETF) - Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 - Invesco QQQ - Technology, NASDAQ top 100....Apple, Google, Microsoft, ect.  10% Individual Stocks - NVDA, META, AAPL, AMZN, MCD, TSLA, SHOP, etc.  5% XXUS (ETF)- VXUS-Vanguard Total International Stock ETF - ETF with international exposure.    Should I approach my IRA account any differently? For example instead of these ETFs mentioned above, maybe get more dividend driven ETFs such as SCHD, VYM, SPYD, DGRO, etc?,;,; 2023-09-05 00:05:30]
[Market trading at high valuations given rates, economy slowing expectations,;,; I don't want to dive super deep. Right now my portfolio has swapped a few times from short term bonds to stocks and to long term bonds. I bought short term bonds in July and moved to longterm when I saw it hit 5% on longer term yields, then the market dropped along with yields and I swapped to stocks thinking I could average down. The market (QQQ) snapped back up at 375 and I swapped back to short term bonds.  I was looking to move to stocks at some point but the valuations remind me a lot of 2021 where large cap tech lead to oversaturation.   I guess my main question is given my portfolio which is 100% bonds at the moment and up 24.7% for the year, should I just go fully stock or should I stick with my fundamentals and believe that the market isn't priced right (especially large cap tech stocks like NVDA, TSLA, GOOGL, MSFT) and wait for rates to fall (and I expect a slowing US economy)?  Also I would like to hear everyone's thoughts on the value of the us economy, rates and large cap market dominance and whether this is a bull run or just long term stagflation?,;,; 2023-11-20 06:05:52]
[Nvidia‚Äôs stock could fly to $550 amid ‚Äòrobust demand‚Äô across the board in AI, analyst says,;,; Nvidia Corp. is benefiting from ‚Äúrobust demand‚Äù for artificial-intelligence servers across the board, and that could help extend the stock‚Äôs stunning rally, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets.  KeyBanc analyst John Vinh upped his price target on shares of Nvidia NVDA, -0.76% to $550 from $500 late Monday, with his new target among the highest on Wall Street: Above Vinh‚Äôs $550 target were one $767 target price and two $600 target prices, according to FactSet. C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI matched Vinh at $550.  Shares closed Monday at $421.80, and they‚Äôre up 189% so far this year.  Vinh‚Äôs heightened optimism about Nvidia‚Äôs prospects comes after he conducted channel checks in Asia. Those indicated strong interest in AI servers that are ‚Äúnot only coming from cloud but also enterprise and from AI startups,‚Äù he wrote in a note to clients.  Additionally, he said he sees the potential for Nvidia to benefit from delays related to an Advanced Micro Devices Inc. AMD, +0.36% product.  ‚ÄúDelays associated with AMD‚Äôs MI300 are likely to free up incremental capacity in 2H23, while we believe NVDA has secured enough capacity (CoWoS) to quadruple its datacenter revenues in 2024,‚Äù Vinh wrote, referring to chip-on-wafer-on-substrate, a type of packaging.   That said, Vinh also boosted his price target on shares of AMD, despite more ‚Äúmixed‚Äù channel checks there, compared with the ‚Äúpositive‚Äù ones for Nvidia.  ‚ÄúWhile near-term challenges associated with delays of its MI300 AI server and stability issues with its PC NB Ryzen Phoenix (7040) could result in near-term risk to estimates, AI server wins at HP/El Capitan, MSFT, and Meta give us high conviction that AMD could see well over $2B in AI revenues in 2024,‚Äù Vinh wrote, as he lifted his price target on the shares to $160 from $150.  Chip companies will begin reporting earnings in the coming weeks, and one trend to watch will be how server demand is playing out more broadly. ‚ÄúAI servers [are] seeing outsized demand but appear to be cannibalizing traditional server,‚Äù Vihn wrote in his note to clients.  He also flagged overall weakness in China, ‚Äúwith no signs of a recovery, which is limiting the inventory destocking process.‚Äù     2023-07-11 12:46:44]

[Square Off: 4 Red flags that make SQ stock a risky bet,;,; * With Block (SQ) facing multiple, intense threats, I urge investors to sell SQ stock. * There is significant competition in the payment app space.  * The valuation of SQ stock is still unattractive.  Block ($SQ) is facing an array of intense, ominous threats, and its shares are not exactly cheap. Given these points, I continue to recommend that investors sell SQ stock.        The company is somewhat vulnerable to declines in the value of bitcoin, and Square‚Äôs involvement in cryptos exacerbates the chances that regulators will look to probe recent charges against it that were made by a short seller.        Meanwhile, I‚Äôm more convinced than ever that Square‚Äôs Cash App is facing a great deal of competition.  # Potential Declines in Bitcoin‚Äôs Value Are a Headline Risk for SQ Stock      The SEC has cracked down on multiple crypto exchanges already and is likely to soon initiate legal action against the largest crypto exchange, Coinbase ($COIN), investment bank Berenberg wrote recently.        I believe that the looming crackdown on Coinbase will cause the value of Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptos to plummet.        As of last year, Block owned 8,027 Bitcoin, which is now worth $$216.2 million.        Additionally, in the first quarter, Block‚Äôs Cash App generated a gross profit of $50 million from bitcoin trading.        These figures suggest that Block‚Äôs exposure to crypto is not very high, since its total gross profit came in at $1.73 billion in Q1, while its total cash and short-term investments amounted to more than $6 billion as of the end of Q1.        Still, I believe that some retail investors could sell SQ stock on very adverse news involving crypto, given the company‚Äôs association with the sector.  # Square‚Äôs Association With Crypto Increases Its Regulatory Risks      As I‚Äôve noted in the past, senior members of the Biden administration, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, have long expressed hostility to cryptos. As a result, I believe that Square‚Äôs involvement with cryptos increases the chances that the U.S. will investigate the charges levelled against the company by Hindenburg.        The latter firm conducts research on stocks and shorts some of them. After conducting extensive research into SQ, it released a report on the company in March and noted that it was shorting SQ stock.        Hindenburg alleged that Block had allowed many ‚Äúfake‚Äù accounts to be launched, while many of those accounts were utilized for fraudulent purposes and allowed criminals to evade detection. According to Hindenburg, the amount of interchange fees charged by Block exceed legal limits.        The firm wrote that ‚Äúup to 35% of Cash App‚Äôs revenue comes from interchange fees.‚Äù In 2022, Cash App generated $10.63 billion of revenue, out of Square‚Äôs total top line of $17.5 billion.        Of course, any probe of these allegations by the U.S. government would result in SQ stock taking a big hit.  # A Large Amount of Competition      In the past, I‚Äôve noted that Cash App is facing a great deal of competition. But recently noted that Alphabet ($GOOGL) and Meta ($META) offer payment apps that compete with Cash App. Add in PayPal ($PYPL) and large banks‚Äô Zelle app, which I have mentioned previously, and it‚Äôs clear that Cash App is facing a staggering amount of competition from many large companies with huge amounts of marketing power.  # The Valuation of SQ Stock Is Still Unattractive      SQ stock has tumbled 18.49% in the three months that ended on May 18. But the shares still have a forward price-earnings ratio of 34.25, making them far from cheap.        Given the company‚Äôs many threats and the fact that its valuation is still elevated, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wise for investors to hold SQ stock at this point.,;,; 2023-05-23 11:17:13]
[FactSet's Earnings Update with 84% of the the S&amp;P 500 Companies Reporting (about 80% of market cap),;,; [Here's the usual weekly Factset update](  # Earnings and Revenue YoY Decline  With 84% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (and 80% of the market cap roughly) having reported, the new blended earnings estimate is -5.2% YoY--one week ago, their estimate was -7.4%, so we surprised to the upside. The blended revenue estimate is +0.6% YoY. [Blended just means combine estimates of companies that haven't reported with those that have]  # Beating/Missing Earnings  &gt; Of these companies, 79% have reported actual EPS above estimates, which is above the 5-year average of 77% and above the 10-year average of 73%. [...]  &gt; In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings that are 7.2% above estimates, which is below the 5-year average of 8.4% but above the 10-year average of 6.4%.  So 80% are beating (on average 73% do), and they are beating estimates by 7.2% on average (which is typical). Yes, analysts lowered estimates.  # Sectoral Breakdown  The year over year declines in earnings are driven entirely by 3 sectors: Energy, Materials, and Health Care. All other sectors are seeing year over year growth. Similarly, the revenue declines are only in 3 sectors: utilities, energy, materials. Notice health care missing? In fact, the top 3 sectors by revenue growth are consumer discretionary, financials, and health care. My conclusion is that healthcare's earnings decline is driven by steep margin compression. [Patents expiring? Post-Covid operations increasing costs for insurers?] While energy/materials are just seeing revenue tank and thus earnings.  Top 3 earnings sectors are Consumer discretionary, Communication Services, Industrials. Guessing thanks to AMZN, META, GOOG, CAT.  # Valuations  Valuations are basically a little over average but not insane.  &gt; The forward 12-month P/E ratio is 19.2, which is above the 5-year average (18.6) and above the 10-year average (17.4). It is also slightly above the forward P/E ratio of 19.1 recorded at the end of the second quarter (June 30).,;,; 2023-08-04 20:48:19]
[Analyzing a Company's Potential for Rapid Expansion: #RBLX - A Glimpse into the Metaverse,;,; I have a clear vision of the Metaverse world and its immense potential for the future. My focus is on identifying stocks that have the capacity to shape and embody this vision. Initially, I invested in AMD back in 2016, primarily because it was more affordable compared to Intel, and I happened to get lucky. In 2018, I added NVIDIA to my portfolio as I had a deep interest in gaming and GPU/computer building. In 2020, I purchased an Oculus device, which allowed me to glimpse into an untapped future. Interestingly, Facebook, now META, has emerged as a dominant player in this space. It's possible that they will enjoy several years of success, much like Intel did in 2016.        Recently, I discovered Roblox, a company that shares my vision and embodies how I envision the true metaverse operating. They have a long road ahead, but with the right talent within the company, they have the potential to achieve their goals. Patience will be crucial since the key lies in retaining their user base into adulthood rather than solely targeting adults at present. This journey will undoubtedly take years. Furthermore, their success is reliant on partnerships with NVIDIA and other hardware manufacturers who can provide the necessary technology. I believe Roblox could be the interface we rely on as AI progresses and 3D/VR technology becomes more advanced.        Considering all this, I seek advice on whether to invest in this company now or wait for future developments, especially if I anticipate Roblox to resemble the fictional 'Innovative Online Industries' from the book Ready Player One. While there seems to be a collective vision for the future, the uncertainty lies in identifying the company that can bring it to life. What are your thoughts on this matter?,;,; 2023-05-27 05:16:02]
[What happened to $TSLA this week?,;,; Welcome my weekly $TSLA update.                **1) Volkswagen confirms talks with Tesla over NACS charging standard.**        Volkswagen is considering using Tesla's charging connector for its electric vehicles in North America, potentially joining Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS). The company is currently in talks with Tesla about adopting this connector for its Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, and future Scout brands in the region.        **2) Tesla set for record quarter in China.**        Analysts predict that Tesla is likely to achieve a new sales record in China despite competition from local rivals. Estimates suggest Tesla could sell around 155,000 cars in China from April to June, marking a 13% increase from the previous quarter, although its market share may decline slightly due to increased competition from companies like BYD and Aion.        **3) Tesla sales forecast for Q2: 440,000-450,000 deliveries.**        As the second quarter comes to a close, Tesla remains the dominant force in the electric vehicle market, with estimated sales forecasts for Q2 ranging from 441,000 to 448,000 vehicles. The Model Y is expected to outpace other models, and while Tesla's production is increasing, concerns arise regarding the gap between production and deliveries. The upcoming release of the Cybertruck and a lower-cost Tesla model are seen as crucial for sustaining Tesla's growth.        **4) Elon vs. Zuck: it's officially happening.**        Tech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have engaged in social media banter about a potential cage fight between them, generating publicity and attention. However, it remains uncertain whether the fight will actually take place, and some speculate that the discussion may serve as a distraction from recent negative news surrounding Meta's decision to cut off news access in Canada and Musk's declining reputation--according to data from Morning Consult.                **PS:** links + update in your inbox every week, [here]( 2023-06-29 22:23:03]

[(Bloomberg) Apple Vision Pro deliveries are delayed to March,;,; "*Apple Inc. began taking preorders for its long-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Friday, and early indications suggest that buyers are snapping up initial supplies of the $3,499 device.*         *The product went on sale at 8 a.m. Eastern time on Apple‚Äôs website and mobile app, ahead of its rollout on Feb. 2. Delivery dates for all three models quickly slipped to March 8-15 for online orders, and the device was sold out for in-store pickup on day one at many locations. The delay signals that either demand is strong or supplies are limited ‚Äî or something in between.*  *Apple shares gained as much as 1.8% to $191.95 Friday in New York, erasing most of its 2% decline for January.*         *With the launch, the company disclosed two additional configurations: a version with 512 gigabytes of storage for $3,699, and a top-end model with 1 terabyte of space for $3,899. The base model includes 256 gigabytes of storage. The company also said it would sell a carrying case for $199 and additional batteries for $199, while extra bands will cost $99 a piece.*         *The purchasing process for the Vision Pro is unique. Customers need to use a recent iPhone or iPad to scan their head and, if necessary, provide a vision prescription. Apple typically doesn‚Äôt comment on the sales performance of new products.*    *Wall Street analysts are predicting a slow start for the device. UBS Group AG analyst David Vogt expects Apple to ship 300,000 to 400,000 units this year, generating as much as $1.4 billion. For a company that had sales of $383 billion last year, that‚Äôs ‚Äúimmaterial.‚Äù*  *Still, the idea is to set the stage for something bigger. Apple is entering its first major new product category since the company began selling smartwatches in 2015, and the Vision Pro may take years to catch on. Apple will continue to refine the headset ‚Äî making it cheaper and more comfortable ‚Äî and find compelling applications for the device.*        *In the longer run, Apple could use a fresh moneymaker. The smartphone market has matured, and it‚Äôs under particular pressure in China. The company‚Äôs revenue has fallen for four straight quarters ‚Äî its longest streak of declines in more than two decades.*  *Initially, the Cupertino, California-based company only plans to sell the Vision Pro in the US, with launches in other markets coming in the months ahead. The company is eyeing the UK, Canada and China as some of the first other countries, Bloomberg News has reported.*        *It‚Äôs a complex product to manufacture, which could limit early supplies. The dual 4K resolution displays in the headset, which melds virtual and augmented reality, have suffered production snags. But the fact that Apple has been ramping up manufacturing for months suggests that it will be able to satisfy initial demand. The company is also offering a 25% discount on the device for employees, signaling that supplies aren‚Äôt too tight.*  *Inside Apple, executives are anticipating a strong opening weekend, with sales tapering off later. At $3,499, the Vision Pro is one of the priciest consumer headsets ever ‚Äî about seven times more expensive than the latest device from VR market leader Meta Platforms Inc.*        *The Vision Pro also will be a hard product to share with family and friends. It requires a precise fitting process to ensure a good experience. The face scan is designed to determine the best light seal and strap size for users. The company has prepared 25 different light seals ‚Äî a cushion that prevents light from seeping into the wearer‚Äôs field of view ‚Äî in addition to two straps. There also are prescription lens inserts, at an additional cost.*         *And the headset may be hard for some people to wear for extended periods. In early testing, some users have found it to be too heavy.*        *Another concern that‚Äôs cropped up in recent days is a lack of support from top streaming apps. Netflix Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Google‚Äôs YouTube are opting not to release software for the device, at least at launch.*        *But Apple has carefully refined its sales pitch for the headset. When consumers try it out at Apple retail stores, they‚Äôll get a 25-minute demo, letting them get comfortable with the 3D experience that the company calls ‚Äúspatial computing.‚Äù*        *To commemorate the launch, Apple executives Mike Rockwell and Alan Dye discussed the device in a Q&amp;A shared with employees this week.*        *A key focus, said Dye, was ensuring that the Vision Pro didn‚Äôt have a closed-in feel ‚Äî a complaint with VR headsets.*        *‚ÄúFrom the onset, we all had concerns about people sitting with their eyes covered and disconnected from the world,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt really became central to how we thought about the core principles of the product.‚Äù*        *That led to the EyeSight system, which can show a wearer‚Äôs eyes through a screen on the front of the Vision Pro. ‚ÄúIt was a huge technical challenge to do this in a way that looks and feels natural,‚Äù Rockwell said.*        *Apple also developed an interface that doesn‚Äôt require handheld accessories. Instead, it tracks eye movement and hand gestures. Users control the device by looking at an on-screen item and pinching their fingers together to select it.*        *One of the biggest selling points may be how easy it makes collaboration, Rockwell said. Users in far-flung locations can feel like they‚Äôre in the same place.*        *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the closest thing to being there in person that you can possibly have,‚Äù Rockwell said. ‚ÄúIt changes the way you collaborate and is very different from videoconferencing as we know it.‚Äù*  .................................  *  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2024-01-21 15:15:31]
[The future picks and shovels of AI may not be GPUs but ASICs, following the crypto trajectory. GOOGL and the dreaded Samsung appear to be the leaders in this space. What is the highest-weighted Samsung ETF and what are other industry-leading AI FPGA/ASICs tickers?,;,; For context and a disclaimer, I own NVDA (and AAPL and ASML) in this space, having ridden through the last crash and rebound without checking my portfolio and counting fake money, but I am overexposed and don't want to add to the overweighted positions now.   I think that NVDA will always be an important company at the forefront of AI research, there is a good chance that NVDA's trajectory could be similar to its performance after the fall of cr*pto for the same reasons. In NVDA's favor, you can read any AI paper, which will be benchmarked on NVDA GPUs, download the requisite libraries, and do it yourself. It is a royal pain to implement algorithms on any other GPU even if you found a programmer with a 5-page blog post about how to do it with lots of particular versions of out-dated libraries, so I own NVDA. CUDA rocks, but NVDA doesn't want to let it out. Metal for OSX is pretty good, but no one uses it and AAPL doesn't do serious system on a chip cluster/cloud computing yet, though they will have an announcement 2-3 years out given Tim Cook's slow feet. For example, we are going to see AAPL AR/VR this week, but he probably didn't shovel out AAPL's piles of cash until FB announced that it was now Meta and that Zuckerberg would be the lord of the metaverse with the most awesome meta-real-estate.  Back to the previous fall of NVDA, you could once pool mine shitcoins with GPUs, I've done it, but that became energetically unprofitable when people found a cheaper way to do it, first with FPGAs and then with ASICs, which require millions and millions more to make work once you know exactly what you need to make. The advantage is that fewer operations occur with parallelizable algorithms, and FPGAs use less energy than do-anything GPU/CPU computations, but they are an expensive pain to program. When you are absolutely done building a better mousetrap, ASICs use the least amount of energy and can perform operations much faster and price-out GPUs in terms of upfront costs (once printed) and recurring energy costs. There was a time when you couldn't but NVDA's best GPUs for gaming because people were using them to mine shitcoins (diclaimer: I own a less than 5% stake of ETH2, and negligible bitcoin, only as an alternative to shit-yield savings accounts, which would be better off in treasuries anyway). I digress. A point came where it was dumb to mine with GPUs because ASICs arrived, and proof-of-work algorithms made it dumb to mine in the first place, which was waste of carbon footprint in the first place. Then, NVDA GPU prices crashed along with NVDA stock, but NVDA was still the machine learning leader. At some point, this will happen to NVDA again. MSFT is already shoveling cash at AMD to build their next AI supercomputer to undercut NVDA prices, but AMD's price is too high right now for me, even when I love tech stocks as I don't plan to retire for decades, and I think AMD won't win with their GPUs in the very long term because of ASICs, even if they make a CUDA-clone language and open source it.    Years ago, a paper titled "Attention is all you need" rocked the AI world and spawned GPT, GPT2, up to GPT4. Given the fifth largest GPU-based supercomptuer, a search engine's worth of data that people gave away, you can build a great AI mousetrap that can do the job students and corporate middle managers and pencil pushers. In a decade or two, programming complex programs with human-levels of bugs and mistakes will be a reality. We have a good mousetrap. Googles TPU v4 supercomputers use optics-based AI ASICs produced and patented by Samsung. I used to be a fan of Samsung, but then new management took over and it has dived off a cliff. Their appliances have the performance of robots bathed in saltwater, and I swore of Samsung phones after using them since forever when they started pushing shit malware games and apps onto my phone with every urgent security update, and every new phone increasingly locked app developers out of the real hardware, so you could use the Samsung app for a camera, but nothing else. But, and please correct me if I am wrong, I think Samsung may be the current leader in AI ASICs. I thinking GOOGL is still behind and their new Samsung-based supercomputer is the wrong mousetrap, but GOOGL programmers have certainly already been tasked with building a GOOGL v5 supercomputer that is dedicated to the transformers that underpin GPT through GPT4. I don't own GOOGL, but I may buy it during market corrections.    Unfortunately, I don't have hundreds of K for an international account, and the Samsung OTC ticker doesn't correlate with Samsung's price in Korea and I don't trust it. I read about ETFs trying to reduce Samsung's weight, but I want an ETF that is dominated by it. Samsung still makes great sensors, invests heavily in research, and some departments within the fetid bureaucracy are still highly competent. So, please offer any ETF suggestions. I am fine with also investing in Korea's broader tech industry, despite the problems with Asian tech companies and their lagging China-based supply chains and the problems with China deciding that money is no longer free in its state-based kleptocracy economy.   Please send me any tickers that I can research that may not have caught the current AI wave and that might still be well positioned for large future returns assuming that AI ASICs become the future, which I feel is a given. This might include companies dedicated to programming FPGAs and ASICs.,;,; 2023-06-02 16:41:58]
[In 2023, just 38% of large-cap active funds outperformed their benchmarks.,;,; [Passive investing rules Wall Street now, topping actively managed assets in stock, bond and other funds](  * The total on hand for exchange-traded funds and notes, along with passively managed mutual funds, totaled $13.29 trillion at the end of December, nudging higher than the $13.23 trillion held in actively managed funds, according to Morningstar. * That movement in money accompanied a rough year for stock pickers. Just 38% of large-cap active funds outperformed their Russell index benchmarks.   Passive investment products have long been pulling in the lion‚Äôs share of money from investors, but as 2023 came to a close they achieved a milestone: holding more assets than their actively managed counterparts.  The total assets under management in exchange-traded funds and notes along with passively managed mutual funds reached a combined $13.29 trillion at the end of December, nudging above the $13.23 trillion held in active assets, according to Morningstar.  While passively managed stock funds long ago took the lead, this was the first time that passively managed products surpassed active across all asset classes combined.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long time coming,‚Äù said Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research and one of Wall Street‚Äôs closest trackers of the ETF industry since it first started drawing investor attention. ‚ÄúLast year with equities it was a very difficult year for active outperformance. ... It was a year when you had an initial burst of enthusiasm for a few months, then a pullback and then a rush at the end. Kind of a nightmare scenario for an active manager.‚Äù  Indeed, just in large-cap blended funds alone, passive funds raked in a net $192.8 billion for the year while active funds lost $48.6 billion, Morningstar reported. Large-cap growth funds saw a net $38.3 billion move to passive funds while active lost $91.2 billion.  That movement in money accompanied a rough year for stock pickers. Just 38% of large-cap active funds outperformed their Russell index benchmarks, down from 47% in 2022 although around the long-term average, according to Bank of America.  In contrast, passive funds, which primarily track market indexes such as the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite, had a strong year thanks to a big performance from the broader market. The S&amp;P 500 alone had a 24% return for the year.  ‚ÄúYou had to be right there when the liftoff happened going into November and December,‚Äù Colas said. ‚ÄúIn many ways, it was the hardest possible environment for active managers to keep their cool, stay focused and not get overly optimistic or pessimistic.‚Äù  Adding to the challenges was the performance of the ‚ÄúMagnificent 7‚Äù tech-centric stocks ‚Äî Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Nvidia, Meta and Amazon  ‚Äî which carried most of the weight for the market. The Nasdaq 100, which is weighted toward technology, exploded 55% higher last year on a total return basis.  ‚ÄúYou had this remarkable market leadership in Big Tech and some managers can‚Äôt own it because of mandates or a reluctance to have 25%-plus of their portfolio in a handful of names,‚Äù Colas said.  Still, there could be hope ahead for active management if market conditions change in 2024.  ‚ÄúAs far as what a stock-pickers market looks like, it‚Äôs basically a low-volatility, low-correlation market without a lot of drawdowns that instill fear into money managers and force them to sell at the bottom,‚Äù Colas said. ‚ÄúThis could be that kind of year.‚Äù,;,; 2024-01-18 19:27:55]
[STMicroelectronics (STM) is one of the best and most undervalued European stocks,;,; I'll preface this by saying I'm just an amateur retail investor and I'm self-taught so please be gentle in case I have misunderstood something. Here goes.  STMicroelectronics (STM) is the best and one of the most undervalued European stocks in my opinion. If you look at valuation, their potential and current numbers it's insane. Honestly I think you could make your money several times over with this one (3x, 4x bagger potentially) in the the medium-term.  STM makes chips for automotive, energy, industrial mainly, plus personal electronics, sensors and that kind of thing (so not CPUs or GPUs like NVDA or Intel or whatever, instead their competitors are ON Semi, Infineon, etc.). Among their clients you can find Apple, Tesla, Google, META, SpaceX, Huawei, Stellantis, BYD, BMW, Airbus + a myriad of others. They are the main chip supplier of some of these companies.  First things first, valuation is really super low. STM typically traded around 15-25 PE in the years before and since the pandemic (around 16 PE in 2021, and 24 in 2020-21), which is more or less typical for the sector. It's now been less than 10PE (going as low as 7) for like a year (as of writing this post it is around 9), and the stock was shorted to death throughout 2022 and even parts of 2023. Looking at the whole picture (zoom out on the chart) its price has really gone nowhere despite the fact they grew revenues and profits 20% over 2022, and those profits and revenue levels have proven quite resilient throughout 2023. They've had gross margins close to 50% for the past couple of years essentially. How can one explain this? From my limited knowledge of the industry, I think a lot of people (most analysts) thought their margins would collapse back down, because for over 10-15 years (before the pandemic) the chips STM made were effectively bought &amp; sold as commodities and were very cheap (STM had really low margins over this period). Everyone thought that the new 40%+ gross margins STM was achieving during and right after the pandemic were a fluke and that STM would go back to having its old terrible margins once things calmed down. Right now, it looks like that thesis is proving to be wrong and the new margins STM is achieving and everything else is basically holding up. They have pricing power now.  Automotive is their main segment nowadays (as well as their most profitable) and even in the current "EV slowdown" they are expecting 30% y-o-y growth for that segment. Their second most significant segment is the personal electronics/PC market, which seems to be turning a corner already after a long period of inventory correction (from which they seem to be coming out of basically unscathed, I saw Samsung is planning to increase prices soon on many of their sensors, which STM also makes, it looks like a positive sign to me regarding demand in the sector). Currently, their third main segment is the industrial market which is their most shakey segment at the minute but even that looks like it may just basically hold up more or less where it currently is.  A few things to note for investors, they don't "reward" shareholders with a lot of buybacks or dividends currently because their deal is that they re-invest 75% of their cash flow into new fabs (4bn net CapEx this year for example, plus they are getting a ton of subsidies in the context of reshoring chip production in Europe, etc.), focusing on increasing the company's fundamental value in that way. They have a stated objective of 20bn revenue for 2025-2027 with 50% gross margin.  Currently their net margin is around 27-30%. They were at 15bn yearly revenue in 2022 and this year will end up around 17bn total revenue. If they get more efficient as the new fabs ramp-up, which is always the case in the industry as I understand, I can see their margins holding up and them reaching their stated objectives in 2025-2026 depending on the macro picture. They are perfectly positioned for the major transitions the whole world is driving to (transport electrification, edge AI, industrial automation, renewable energy, etc.)  Here are some stats based on the last 12 months: Gross margin TTM 47.21% Operating margin TTM 29.4% Net Profit margin TTM 27.23% Return on Investment TTM 28.1%  Their current net cash position is around 2.5bn, reflecting liquidity of 5bn and total debt of 2.5bn. Over the last 4 quarters, they have had revenues between 4.2bn and 4.5bn per quarter, achieving 1bn+ net income in each quarter (which they are re-investing massively in expanding the company as mentioned above).  I have been following this stock for a couple of years at this point and it has been baffling to me how it hasn't taken off much more than this. I get it that it's the CAC40 and not the S&amp;P or Nasdaq, but still they have an ADR and honestly I can see STM becoming one the main and most well-known European stocks in the near-future once the new business cycle really takes off (possibly sooner than later at this point?).,;,; 2023-12-03 10:24:14]
[Expectations and Realizations on the current state of the Market,;,; Today we had a cold plunge into reality, CPI came in hot and stocks corrected, and even thought it probably was a bit over the board, if the market turns sour its never wrong to have a runaway plan. From my perspective the market will keep running, earnings strength has been great overall and this last inflation print is not that bad, next I would like to share my views on some industries and my forecast for the future,  feel free to argue in the comment section.  **ENERGY (OIL) :**  Okay, lets start with the energy market, volatility has been large since 2020, great profits have been made since then. Global mayhem on oil and gas producing countries has generated great buying opportunities on futures, and companies of the sector in general have grown largely in profits, still the market has been very wary in pricing them for several reasons, but mainly because of over the board positive predictions on switching the economy towards green energy. During the economic boom of the last decade this could be seen as possible, but the switch is cost heavy and the money right now is not there. As off right now crude oil is on the rise, the march 2024 contract goes for 77.83$ during the last month it has risen 7%, tensions in the middle east are high and it can cause a sharp rise in prices, I would not be surprised if it reaches 90$ in the recent future.  Personally im positive on the oil market and currently hold positions in Petrobras (PBR) and Chevron (CVX) recent earnings on both companies have been great, currently I don‚Äôt plan in selling those positions.  &amp;#x200B;  **TECH:**  &amp;#x200B;  The TECH ride has been wild for the last few months, micro chips companies have been rising with a strength that has yet to be broken, NVDA leads the rise 64% positive in the last 6 months, but id like to remark the META Phoenix rising to beat the shit out of any bear that dared shorting it.  Personally I have mostly sold out of the large names of the sector already fearing they might be a bit overbought, but still hold two highly speculative positions. SoFi which I acquired pretty recently and RKLB which I have been holding for a while now. Sincerely I like both of the businesses, but they are stupidly speculative and if anything goes wrong they dump heavily as any small stock would.  &amp;#x200B;  **BANKING AND FINANCE:**  &amp;#x200B;  Today we got smacked down in this sector, I sincerely don't care for the CPI print, rates will inevitably come down, and when this happens the banking sector will boom, I was great at timing the top of the interest rate hike and at that time bought into Citigroup ( C ),  BANK OF AMERICA ( BAC ) and TLT ( ETF for treasury bonds with maturity over 20 years) .  My outlook for the sector is good, Bonds will get great capital gains as interest rates come down, specially longer durations which where severely punished during the banking Schism of 2022-2023, I will probably mantain those 3 positions for a few years until rates drop low enough.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **PHARMA:**  &amp;#x200B;  The dear child of 2020 has been dropped from the top of the skyrise, the patent cliff is coming for companies like pfizer and the sector in general seems to have no bottom, personally I don't own anything here, but if Mr Market keeps beating the shit out of the sector it will inevitably generate good opportunities.  &amp;#x200B;  **Media/Streamers:**  &amp;#x200B;  Controversial and Volatile sector to say the least, somehow Netflix seems to be winning the streamer wars (for some reason everyone is addicted to Suits 4 years later. Go figure) behind Netflix we have Disney coming out of heavy losses from 2023, but still in the race and a bit further behind we get WBD and PARA that are just trying to survive at this point. As long as the consumer remains strong PARA and WBD might be able to keep their heads out of the water.  Personally im holding WBD for about a year and a half now, it has not really done anything, some times im up, some times im down. At the moment it just seemed like a great value play that had been beaten a bit too much by the market to pass up. Hell, it still looks like it to me, but im definitely biased.  Still, outside of DC their movies last year where great and their gaming sector is growing pretty fucking fast. MAX numbers are a bit disappointing since they have published award winning series behind one another but still have managed to get marginal growth. For me, the value there is still there for the taking, but thread with caution, debt levels are still not nice at all.  &amp;#x200B;  **CONCLUSIONS:**  &amp;#x200B;  Well, those are my views for today, I sincerely think there is no reason for the market to correct sharply , but we should be wary of some drunk valuations being thrown around by Mr Market. What is your outlook on the industries I mentioned above? And where do you think we will find the market 6 months from now?,;,; 2024-02-13 23:14:17]
[NVDA shares have tripled in 2023, while the Nasdaq-100 has climbed 38% and the S&amp;P 500 has gained 16%,;,; AI Mania Triggers Dot-Com Bubble Flashbacks  Nvidia shares have nearly tripled this year. Investors question whether the stock can live up to the hype.  The dot-com bubble taught investors to be wary of stock-market rallies powered by a technological boom‚Äîthat is, until generative artificial intelligence sent tech stocks soaring this year.  Shares of Nvidia NVDA -0.39%, the graphics-chip maker at the heart of the frenzy, have nearly tripled in 2023, while the Nasdaq-100 has climbed 38% and the S&amp;P 500 has gained 16%.  For some investors, the surge in Nvidia‚Äînow the fifth-largest U.S. company by market value‚Äîis difficult to chalk up to anything but speculative mania. Its weighting in the benchmark stock indexes means everyday investors are at the whims of its trajectory, whether they believe in AI‚Äôs potential or not.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge boom in AI‚Äîsome people are scrambling to get exposure at any cost, while others are sounding the alarm that this will end in tears,‚Äù said Kai Wu, founder and chief investment officer of Sparkline Capital. ‚ÄúInvestors can benefit from innovation-led growth, but must be wary of overpaying for it.‚Äù  Nvidia is the primary producer of semiconductors backing artificial-intelligence systems. The company forecast a record $11 billion in sales for the recently ended quarter when it reported results in May, catching analysts off guard with the projected surge in customer demand.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when the excitement around AI really ramped up,‚Äù said Ryan McCormack, an Invesco senior exchange-traded fund strategist.   The hype has driven companies such as Meta Platforms and Amazon.com that have been building out AI capabilities, he said. Shares of the tech giants are up 154% and 65% in 2023, respectively. Microsoft, which has climbed 35%, has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, a chatbot that can answer difficult questions in seconds.  The furious rally in those stocks, long the market‚Äôs biggest drivers, has fanned worries about market concentration. The 10 biggest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 now comprise more than a third of the market, according to Dow Jones Market Data. They represented 27% of the index at the start of the year and less than a quarter in 2000.  ‚ÄúThe market story that rhymes most with the internet bubble is the concentration of leadership,‚Äù said Mike Edwards, deputy chief investment officer of Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers.  Nvidia‚Äôs second-quarter earnings report, due Aug. 23, will provide insight into whether its inexorable rise is well-rooted in demand for chips, or a product of hype. The stock gained 24% in the trading session after its earnings reported in May, and 14% the day following February‚Äôs results.  Investors are paying up for the shares, betting on a windfall down the line. Nvidia is trading at 41 times its sales from the last 12 months, according to FactSet, compared with 2.4 times sales for the S&amp;P 500. On a forward basis, the stock trades at 20 times its expected sales for the year ahead‚Äîdouble its average over the last decade of 10 times, according to Dow Jones Market Data.   The nascency of AI programs such as ChatGPT means it is likely too early to determine whether Nvidia can raise revenue in line with the eye-watering valuation investors have slapped on its shares. If the company‚Äôs growth isn‚Äôt enough to reflect its price, the stock could crater.  A basket of 43 high-multiple internet stocks‚Äîthose worth at least $5 billion that traded at 25 times their revenue at the turn of the century‚Äîcrashed 80% over the next two years, according to Sparkline.   The companies weren‚Äôt duds, either. Their sales grew 10-fold in the ensuing two decades. But investors were badly bruised from the bust: The shares returned an average of 16% in that time span. The S&amp;P 500 returned 284%.  The basket included Amazon and Microsoft, both darlings of today‚Äôs market, along with Cisco Systems, then one of the largest companies in the Nasdaq-100. The networking- equipment maker traded as high as 38 times its sales in early 2000. Cisco has returned 43% since the start of the century‚Äîit is down 0.4% when excluding dividends.  ‚ÄúValuations matter,‚Äù said Wu. ‚ÄúInvesting in stocks exposed to rapidly growing technologies only works if the growth is not already priced in. Unfortunately, in periods of euphoria, the market has a tendency not only to price in potential growth, but to greatly overextrapolate it.‚Äù  One reason why this rally might lack the boom-and-bust nature of the dot-com bubble: The beneficiaries of artificial intelligence were the stocks already shining this year. Investors were flocking to big tech in the first quarter, seeking shelter in strong balance sheets and cash flows.  Tech companies are also benefiting from the expected end of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest-rate campaign and resilient consumer spending. Cyclical sectors of the broader market have begun to catch up now that recession fears are fading.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like 1999 when investors were racing to hot IPOs for companies that had no chance of making money,‚Äù said Edwards. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs winners are disciplined, enormous companies that have moats in place and data sets to exploit.‚Äù,;,; 2023-08-11 12:53:17]
[The Arbitrage case for Spirit Airlines,;,; Related Position Disclosure: I own 14,054 shares of SAVE.  Important Disclaimer:  Nothing in this post is, or should be construed as investment advice.  I describe my reasoning for why I did what I did.  That doesn't mean it is a good idea for you.  You can do your own research, consult a trusted financial advisor, or do whatever it is you think makes the most investing sense.  What you shouldn't do is blindly follow me.  I am not a financial advisor.  I am an amateur investor, and any positive past performance I have enjoyed is not a guarantee of future success.  All investments carry the risk of loss.  This post discusses a particularly risky investment, which will probably not fit with the risk tolerance and goals of all investors.  Per the above disclosure, I am significantly invested in Spirit Airlines.  This investment is recent.  I am not posting because I want to pump up my stock.  Rather, I recently acquired this position because of the reasoning contained herein.  Background:    Spirit Airlines (SAVE) has a deal inked to be acquired by JetBlue, which if it goes through, will result in spirit being acquired with a final payment to shareholders of $31/share.  There are periodic monthly payments to spirit shareholders in the amount of $0.10.  The deal is detailed and there are other provisions I don't mention here.  You can, and probably should look into those yourself if you have any exposure to the deal.  Financing for the deal has been secured.  The DoJ has sued to block the merger, with the case currently going on in the U.S. District Court in Boston.   Downside and Upside potential:  At the time of writing, SAVE is trading at $11.34/share.  That is 173% upside if the deal goes through, without counting the $0.10/share monthly payments.  Spirit is experiencing severe difficulties as a company, due both to diminished demand and due to problems with aircraft engines which will keep numerous planes grounded over the next couple years.  While there is a likelihood of a financial recovery related to delayed delivery of aircraft and defective engines, it is difficult to come to a figure for the fair value of spirit sans-merger.  My own personal estimate is that on deal failure, SAVE would likely trade at around $5 per share, which would be a 56% loss on deal failure.  Lawsuit outlook:  I view the outlook as moderately favoring the deal being approved.  JetBlue is the 6th largest airline in the US, and Spirit is the 7th.  The acquisition would result in JetBlue being the 5th largest airline, with a market share of about 10%, in an industry that is dominated by the big 4 airlines.  That is the single strongest argument for the merger.  It is hard to see how this substantially lessens competition.  There are more issues, however, when you get deep into the weeds.    There are some routes where Spirit and JetBlue could, in combination, have a dominant market share.  The DoJ proposes that these be viewed as individual markets.  JetBlue has made agreements for some divestitures of gates and routes to other Ultra Low Cost Carriers to endeavor to remedy these concerns, which DoJ believes are insufficient.  Spirit is the biggest Ultra Low Cost Carrier, and its absorption by JetBlue would mean the removal of seats from its planes and an increase in ticket costs, which the DoJ will argue will be a harm to consumers.  JetBlue would argue that the increased amenities  on JetBlue are a positive for consumers and that the merger will allow it to compete better with the big 4 airlines, creating a net positive for consumers.  It seems to me that the case against the deal was much stronger before the end of the Northeast Alliance, which involved a high degree of cooperation and coordination between JetBlue and American Airlines.  Additionally, the financial difficulties of Spirit make it difficult to see the company surviving on its own without substantially increasing fares, which cuts against the DoJ case.  In an industry dominated by American, Southwest, Delta, and United, it is hard to see the potential of a 5th strong competitor emerging as a problem for competition.  There remains some possibility that the DoJ and JetBlue will reach some kind of settlement that allows the deal to go through, producing a windfall for shareholders, but the odds of that happening diminish every day.  Other known risks:  There is a non-zero risk that JetBlue could endeavor to back out of the deal by arguing that Spirit has suffered a "Material Adverse Event", in that its business has substantially diminished since the deal was struck.  I view this risk as remote, given that an MAE is an incredibly difficult threshold under Delaware law, and because contract provisions specifically exclude industry-wide events from that definition, and because the aircraft engine issue does affect other airlines, even if not to the same extent that it affects Spirit, and also because the likelihood of financial compensation for this problem from the airplane manufacturer mitigates much of the potential harm in the long term.     There is some possibility that JetBlue could endeavor to reprice the deal lower, using the argument of a Material Adverse Event. It seems moderately likely to me that Spirit would accept a slight discount rather than litigate this issue, but a severe discount appears highly improbable, as Spirit would likely prevail in court if JetBlue were to endeavor to back out, financing is already secured, and the contract does provide the remedy of Specific performance.  Summary:  I view the odds of this deal being successfully completed at somewhere around 70%.  That is no guarantee and of course reasonable minds may differ.  The U.S. Government has recently been on a track of challenging mergers that would traditionally be approved, and this has caused them to lose some big cases (see the Microsoft-Activision or Meta-Within as examples).  A few years ago, an antitrust challenge by the government was usually the death knell of a merger, but that is no longer the case.  If my proposition that this deal is 70% likely to be successful is correct, looking at a timeline resulting in payment early 2024, the risk/reward proposition looks favorable to me.  That doesn't mean I'm right.  It is just what I think.  Note:  In the interest of writing a post, rather than writing a book, I've only included what I view as the most important information.  There is a lot of other information.  You might find the information I didn't include is more important to you than the information I did include.  Please do your own research, and get advice from trusted financial advisors.  I find this interesting, but I'd like to reiterate that my thoughts and musings are not and should not be considered investment advice.  ,;,; 2023-11-01 18:31:03]
[Investment plan for about 85 000$ USD over the coming year,;,; So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years.  I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030.  However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.  I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.  The plan:   \-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)   \-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)   \-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)   \-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)   \-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)   \-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)   \-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)  Some possible additions right now:   \-Considering Invesco **S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&amp;P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)   \-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)   \-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)   \-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)   \-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)   \-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)   \-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)   \-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)   \-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)   \-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)  So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?  Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :),;,; 2023-07-17 12:59:33]
["Seize the bull's momentum: Embrace the remarkable growth potential of this 64% discounted stock!",;,; This e-commerce stock could soar when the economy regains its momentum and consumer spending rebounds.  The S&amp;P 500 fell into a bear market early last year as economic uncertainty weighed on investor sentiment. The situation has improved very little since then. High inflation and rising interest rates contributed to a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter of this year, and many experts believe the situation will culminate in a recession. But there is a silver lining for patient investors.   Bad news tends to create buying opportunities. The S&amp;P 500 is still down 13%, but history says the next bull market is coming. The benchmark index has recovered from every past bear market and recession, and investors have no reason to expect a different outcome this time.   But right now, Shopify (SHOP -1.07%) stock is down 64%, and trading at a discount to its historical valuation. That is a buying opportunity.  **Shopify is the market leader in e-commerce software**      Shopify simplifies commerce. Its software allows merchants to manage their businesses across physical stores and digital sales channels from a single dashboard. That includes online marketplaces like Amazon and social media like Facebook by Meta Platforms, but it also includes custom mobile apps and websites. Shopify also provides ancillary solutions for payments, logistics, and financing, and the Shopify App Store includes thousands of third-party integrations.        That turnkey approach to commerce has made Shopify popular with sellers, especially small and medium-sized businesses. Case in point: Shopify is the market leader in e-commerce software in terms of market presence and user satisfaction. But the company is also growing upmarket. Shopify Plus, a more sophisticated platform built for larger brands, is the most popular omnichannel commerce software on the market. That puts the company in a good position.  Ameco Research expects retail e-commerce sales to grow by 14% annually through 2030, and Grand View Research expects wholesale e-commerce sales to grow by 20% annually over the same period. Shopify will benefit from both tailwinds, but it should grow more quickly than either metric suggests due to its strong market presence and broad portfolio of adjacent merchant solutions.  **Shopify returned to profitability in the first quarter**      Shopify struggled with economic headwinds last year. Sales growth slowed as high inflation hindered consumer spending, and profitability evaporated as ongoing investments put upward pressure on operating costs. But Shopify regained some of its former momentum in the first quarter of this year. Revenue increased 25% to $1.5 billion, an acceleration from 22% growth in the prior year. The company also returned to GAAP profitability with a net income of $0.05 per share, up from a loss of $1.17 per share in the prior year.        Investors should also consider two additional metrics. Plus merchants accounted for 34% of monthly recurring revenue, up from 30% in the prior year, indicating that Shopify Plus continues to gain traction with larger brands. Additionally, Shopify reported an attach rate of 3.04%, up from 2.79% in the prior year. Attach rate is defined as revenue divided by gross merchandise volume and an increasing attach rate means merchants are upgrading to higher subscription tiers and adopting more adjacent services. In other words, Shopify is deepening its relationships with merchants, which makes it more likely those merchants will stick around in the future.        **Shopify stock is trading at a reasonable price**      Shopify is a compelling commerce partner for businesses of all sizes. Its ability to unify physical and digital sales channels behind a single dashboard gives the company an edge over rivals like Amazon. Moreover, Shopify is effectively a one-stop shop for commerce infrastructure due to its extensive portfolio of adjacent solutions.        The company also has a very capable management team. Shopify has consistently developed new products, and it recently sold its logistics business to Flexport. That was likely a difficult decision given the time and money it invested in the project, but it was the right decision. Shopify can now return to its core competency of building software solutions that simplify commerce. That should give investors confidence.   Shares currently trade at 13 times sales, a bargain compared to the three-year average of 32.3 times sales and a reasonable price to pay given Shopify's strong position in a growing market. That's why this growth stock is worth buying.,;,; 2023-05-22 10:09:09]

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, July the 26th, 2023-  *****  # [Stock futures slip as investors digest Big Tech earnings and await Fed decision: Live updates](  ***** &gt; U.S. stock futures fell slightly Wednesday as investors weighed a batch of corporate earnings from major technology names and geared up for the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest interest rate decision. ***** &gt; S&amp;P 500 futures fell slightly, while Nasdaq-100 futures slid 0.1%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 60 points, or 0.2%. ***** &gt; Google-parent Alphabet rose nearly 7% as cloud revenue growth helped propel the company to a better-than-expected quarter. On the other hand, Microsoft slid more than 3% after reporting slowing cloud revenue growth. ***** &gt; Outside of Big Tech, Snap tumbled 19% after giving weak guidance for current-quarter performance. ***** &gt; Investors are counting down to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest interest rate policy decision and subsequent news conference with Chair Jerome Powell scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. The market is pricing in around a 98% chance the central bank raises interest rates, according to the CME Group‚Äôs FedWatch Tool. That would mark a return to hikes after not increasing interest rates in June. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúInvestors will focus on the post meeting press conference and look for any clues about future policy path,‚Äù said Bill Northey, senior investment director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ‚ÄúCommentary from Chair Powell that would indicate more restrictive policy is required to bring inflation under control could dampen recent stock market optimism.‚Äù ***** &gt; Wall Street notched a winning day Tuesday as investors reviewed the latest earnings and made adjustments with the Fed decision on the horizon. After eking out a gain just shy of 0.1%, the Dow clinched its 12th-straight winning session, a streak not seen since for the blue-chip average since February 2017. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite finished about 0.3% and 0.6% higher, respectively. ***** &gt; Beyond the interest rate decision, investors will continue following the latest corporate financial releases on Wednesday. Coca-Cola, Stellantis, Boeing and AT&amp;T are among companies expected to report before the bell, while Meta, Chipotle and Mattel‚Äôs earnings are slated to drop after the market closes.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](  *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!]( ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](  *****  #THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!]( ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!]( ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #3!](  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!]( ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!]( ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](  *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com]()**)  *****  &gt; **(TO BE POSTED LATER THIS MORNING.)** ‚Äî (TO BE POSTED LATER THIS MORNING.).  &gt; #**STOCK SYMBOL:** SPY  &gt; * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](  &gt; ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](  *****  #**FULL DISCLOSURE:**  &gt; /u/bigbear0083 has no positions in any stocks mentioned.

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 24th, 2023,;,; Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 24th, 2023.  # **Stocks end Friday‚Äôs session little changed, Dow snaps 4-week win streak: Live updates - [(Source)]( ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended little changed Friday and finished lower for the week as investors evaluated the latest earnings results and concerns of disappointing profits. ***** &gt; The 30-stock index added 22.34 points, or 0.07%, to end at 33,808.96, while the S&amp;P 500 eked out a 0.09% gain to settle at 4,133.52. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.11% to close at 12,072.46. ***** &gt; All major indices finished the week in the red, with the Dow falling 0.23% to snap a four-week win streak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq saw the biggest decline, falling 0.42%, while the S&amp;P slipped 0.1%. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the continued push-pull of the fact that the economy has been a lot more resilient than many people expected and corporate earnings have held up pretty well, all things considered,‚Äù said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. ***** &gt; Even so, he noted that the Federal Reserve has raised rates substantially over the last year. Zaccarelli said that even if the central bank hikes as anticipated in May, it will likely hold rates at a higher level than the market expects. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúYou can kind of see the the bull and bear case really right there in a nutshell as far as resilient economy with stronger-than-expected corporate earnings versus a very hot, very restrictive monetary policy coming from the Fed,‚Äù he said. ***** &gt; Earnings season continued Friday, with results from Procter &amp; Gamble. The consumer products company gained 3.5% after beating expectations and lifting it sales forecast. As of Friday morning, 76% of S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings so far have beaten analyst EPS estimates, according to FactSet. ***** &gt; Elsewhere, materials stocks were the worst performers, with Freeport-McMoRan falling 4.1%. Albemarle tumbled 10% as Chile said it would nationalize its lithium industry. ***** &gt; While companies broadly beat expectations this week, overall profit reports failed to boost stocks, with some investors fearing an earnings drop looms with a likely recession ahead. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúSo far, earnings season is off to an uneventful start, with many companies meeting already reduced earnings expectations and that helps to explain the lack of movement in the major stock indices over the past few days,‚Äù said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, adding that she expects stocks to trade in a tight range for some time. ***** &gt; Earnings continue next week with results on deck from Big Tech companies Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft.  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](   *****  &gt; # Lithium: The Cycle Continues  &gt; If you haven't checked the price of lithium lately, you might be in for a surprise. Spot prices for lithium carbonate in China have collapsed by two-thirds since hitting record highs in November of last year. Prices have gone from $84k per ton to $25k per ton. That unwinds the vast majority of a spectacular surge that played out from 2020 to 2022. Lithium initially surged 1,279% from July 2020 to March 2022 as part of the broader explosion of commodity prices and booming demand for electric vehicles, eventually peaking up 1,387% from the post-COVID lows. It's easy to forget that this critical battery input had already gone through one such cycle. A 224% rally in 6 months during late 2015 and early 2016 before a long, slow bear market that saw prices down 78% over several years.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; In the equity market, the price cycle hasn't been as dramatic in percentage terms, but there has still nonetheless been a double cycle of surging stock prices in 2016 followed by a grinding bear market, and then an even more dramatic surge through late 2022 that is now sliding into reverse. On Thursday, Chile's government announced reforms to its lithium extraction policy. While existing contracts with firms that operate in the rich lithium brine deposits of the Chilean Atacama desert will be honored, the market is looking at weaker lithium prices and the fact that existing contracts will be replaced by less favorable ones 10+ years down the line and hitting lithium players. SQM is off 21% today while ALB is 10% lower.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # April 2nd Half Strength After Tax Deadline  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; 1st half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has not been the case. Traders are more focused on Q1 earnings and guidance during April than the Tax Deadline nowadays.  &gt; Expectations are low for earnings season and next week is a big week with 35% of S&amp;P 500 stocks reporting next week including AMZN, GOOGL, META &amp; MSFT, compared to less than 12% this week and 2% last week (Hat tip @ScottSchnipper @CNBC @CNBCPro). Better than expected results and upbeat guidance could rally stocks into month-end.  &gt; These 2 charts show how April is tracking usual performance over the last 21 years as well as during pre-election years. April is clearly weaker than normal, yet the market is still tracking the directional trends.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](    *****  &gt; # Jobless Claims Nearing New Highs  &gt; Jobless claims have continued to weaken with this week's release, rising by 5K to 245K versus expectations of no change from last week's upwardly revised 240K print. At current levels, claims sit at the high end of the range since the start of 2022 and only a couple thousand below last month's high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Prior to seasonal adjustment, claims have essentially come in right inline with the reading for the same week last year and the few years prior to the pandemic. As shown in the second chart below, claims tend to experience a little bit of a bounce around this point of the year before resuming a move lower through the late spring.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Continuing claims were equally disappointing this week rising to 1.865 million, 40K above expectations. Although the increase to initial claims has not resulted in a new high, the 61K increase for continuing claims leaves the indicator at the highest level since late November 2021.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Homebuilders Breaking Out Like It's...  &gt; It's hard to get over how well the homebuilder stocks have been performing lately. As shown in the charts below of stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 Homebuilder group, these names are nearly universally in steep six-month uptrends and breaking out as we type.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Below is another way to see just how crazy the run has been for the S&amp;P 1500 Homebuilder stocks lately. Most names are now up 30-40% year-to-date after rallying 5-10% over the last week. This has pushed them ~10% above their 50-DMAs, and many are trading more than two (or even three for some) standard deviations above their 50-DMAs in extreme overbought territory.  &gt; "Mr. Market" has either lost its mind or it's predicting that all the current worries about housing in the months and quarters ahead are misguided.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Sell in May and go away ‚Äì Maybe, it depends  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; In the above table the ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù performance of DJIA, S&amp;P 500, and NASDAQ have been separated by year of the four-year-presidential-election cycle going back to 1951 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 and 1971 for NASDAQ. NASDAQ‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù are July through October compared to May to October for DJIA and S&amp;P 500. Even though pre-election years have historically been the best performing year of the four-year cycle, performance during the ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù has not been the least bit impressive. In 18 pre-election year ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù periods, DJIA has averaged a meager 1.14%. S&amp;P 500 is only slightly better +1.81% while NASDAQ‚Äôs average is under 1%. Frequency of gains or percentage of time higher in pre-election years ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù is only slightly better than 50-50.  &gt; Because of the elevated level of risk that has been historically observed during the ‚ÄúWorst Six Months‚Äù of the year and its historically tepid returns, reducing long exposure and developing a defensive strategy is the approach taken in the Almanac Investor Stock and ETF Portfolios. We do not merely ‚Äúsell in May and go away.‚Äù Instead, we take some profits, trim or outright sell underperforming stock and ETF positions, tighten stop losses and limit adding new long exposure to positions from sectors that have a demonstrated a record of outperforming during the ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù period.  &gt; For those with a lower risk tolerance or a desire to take a break from trading, the ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù are a great opportunity to unwind some longs and move into the relative safety of cash, Treasury bonds, gold and/or some combination of traditional defensive assets. For the first time in over a decade, cash can currently earn something other than zero. Preservation of capital may be more important than growth and with historical averages and frequency of gains reduced; the ‚ÄúWorst Six Months‚Äù are a good time to simply step aside if you prefer. August, September and/or October have provided some excellent buying opportunities over the years and could do the same again this year.  *****  &gt; # Sector Breadth All Over the Place  &gt; In terms of price, the Industrials sector remains 5.75% below its high from January of last year and has yet to even take out the highs from earlier this year, but breadth has been more constructive recently. Just yesterday, the cumulative advance/decline line hit a new all time high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Although that measure of breadth is making promising moves, other breadth measures have not exactly echoed that strength. In spite of the record high in the cumulative A/D line Monday, only 37% of the sector's stocks finished above their 50-DMAs. As shown below, of all other instances of a record high in the cumulative AD line, there has never been such a low reading in the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs. In fact, no other readings have even crossed into the 30% range! For the vast majority of previous highs, the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs has sat at 70% or more.   &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; All that is to say that most Industrials sector stocks are moving higher, but have not yet moved above potential resistance at their 50-DMAs. And even though the reading on the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs is low at the moment, that is not to say it is not improving rapidly. As shown below, it has risen sharply from the low of 19.18% on April 6th. Furthermore, whereas Monday's close only saw 37% of the sector finish above their 50-DMAs, as of mid-morning Tuesday the reading is already up another 8.2 percentage points to 45.2% as the average stock in the sector trades just 7 bps below its 50-DMA.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Volatility Is The Toll We Pay  &gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a proprietary strategy. I can‚Äôt go into it in great detail.‚Äù ‚Äì Bernie Madoff  &gt; Although Bernie Madoff was quite vague when asked how he had a strategy that printed money month after month when no one else could match it, as investors we know one thing and that is markets don‚Äôt always go straight up.  &gt; Burt White, our Managing Director and Chief Strategy Officer, likes to say that volatility is the toll we pay to invest. No one wants to pay a toll, but sometimes you just have to do it to get where you are going. When I lived in Charlotte and would drive back up to Ohio for holidays, I‚Äôd have to pay the great state of West Virginia $4.25 three different times on I-77. I didn‚Äôt like it, but Santa brought the kids presents up there and I had to do it.  &gt; Getting back to the stock market, volatility is that toll that we pay for enjoying longer-term returns. Below is a great chart that sums it up and thanks to our friends at Ned Davis Research for helping us with the data.  &gt; Here‚Äôs what you need to know regarding the S&amp;P 500:  &gt; Each year sees more than seven different 3% percent dips. More than three times a year do stocks correct 5%. About once a year on average sees a 10% correction. A 15% major correction happens every year-and-a-half. A 20% bear markets happens about every three years.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Another quote I like is from Regis Philbin when he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm involved in the stock market, which is fun, but sometimes very painful.‚Äù Well, this year has been fun for investors, but last year was quite painful.  &gt; After more than a 120% rally off the March 2020 lows, maybe the bear market we saw last year shouldn‚Äôt have caught as many investors off guard like it did? We didn‚Äôt quite see a 25% bear market happening last year, but we expected as much as a 15% correction at some point. With the historically aggressive Fed, inflation soaring, China lockdowns, the war, and supply chains in disarray, it was a perfect cocktail for a bear market.  &gt; The truth though is we get spoiled by the good times and when the rough times hit, we are almost surprised that bad times ever happen. Well, they do happen and it is all part of investing, or the toll we pay to invest. Just know this, volatility and bear markets have happened before and will happen again. The good new though is after this bad times, likely better times will be coming!  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 21st, 2023**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4/23/23**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; (*$AMZN $MSFT $META $FRC $KO $BA $VZ $GOOGL $UPS $ENPH $CLF $HAL $MCD $GM $GE $MMM $PEP $XOM $SPOT $INTC $AAL $V $ROKU $RTX $NEE $PHG $CAT $CVX $SNAP $LLY $VLO $LUV $BOH $MA $CROX $SIFY $JBLU $CMG $DOW $MO $ABBV $NOW $DHR $DX $NET $HUM $HLT $MRK $BMRC $PACW*)  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  &gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).  &gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  # DISCUSS!

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, March the 16th, 2023-  *****  # [Dow futures slip, regional bank shares drop: Live updates](  ***** &gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Thursday as regional banks slid once again on growing fears of a crisis in banking within the U.S. and Europe. ***** &gt; Futures tied to the 30-stock index were down 94 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures were down 0.2%, while Nasdaq-100 futures traded up 0.3%. ***** &gt; Credit Suisse announced overnight it will borrow up to nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank to assure short-term liquidity. That offered some relief to the embattled bank in extended hours after it fell to a record low Wednesday following reports that the Saudi National Bank, Credit Suisse‚Äôs largest investor, said it would not provide additional assistance. U.S.-listed shares gained 5% in extended trading after falling just under 14% in the prior session. ***** &gt; But the news was not enough to quell fears on Wall Street of an impending crisis, leading regional banks to take another leg down in Thursday‚Äôs premarket. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) slid 2.6% in extended trading, led down by a more than 26% drop in First Republic Bank. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs also similar to ‚Äô08 is the hunting in the market for who‚Äôs the most weak next,‚Äù said Greg Fleming, CEO of Rockefeller Capital Management and former president of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd the proxy‚Äôs been uninsured deposits.‚Äù ***** &gt; Growing concern over Credit Suisse sent other European banking stocks lower and reverberated in U.S. markets beginning Wednesday. The Dow at one point Wednesday fell 725 points before ending the day down by 280.83 points, or 0.87% lower. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.7%. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no doubt changing the landscape of how we as investors look at the investability of financial institutions that fit in the banking sector,‚Äù said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. ‚ÄúIt also makes us ponder just how the sector would navigate with, in the future, more forms of regulatory pressure on these corporations.‚Äù ***** &gt; Traders will keep an eye out for key economic data, including the latest jobless claims report. Housing starts data from the U.S. Census Bureau is also out at 8:30 a.m. ET.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](  *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!]( ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](  *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!]()**) (N/A.)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](  *****  &gt; **Credit Suisse** ‚Äî U.S.-listed shares of Credit Suisse gained nearly 6% after the Swiss bank said it will borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss National Bank.

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 18th, 2023,;,; Good Friday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 18th, 2023.  # **Dow, Nasdaq close higher Friday, extending rally to a seventh winning week: Live updates- [(Source)]( ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher Friday after a whipsaw session, where it marked a fresh intraday record, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 closed at a record high, as Wall Street pushed both major indexes to their seventh-straight winning week. ***** &gt; The Dow closed up 56 points, or 0.2%, at 37,305.16. The S&amp;P 500 slipped 36 points, or 0.01%, to 4,719.19 while the Nasdaq Composite closed up 52 points, or 0.4% at 14,813.92. The Nasdaq-100 broke above 16,573.34, a record closing high reached in November 2021. ***** &gt; Shares of Costco ended the day up 4.5% after hitting an all-time high during the session. The retailer surpassed Wall Street‚Äôs estimates for quarterly results and issued a dividend of $15 per share. ***** &gt; Both the 30-stock Dow and the tech-heavy Nasdaq notched their seventh straight positive week. As of Friday, the Dow is higher on the month by 3.7%. The S&amp;P 500 is up by 3.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite has climbed 4.2% so far in December. The S&amp;P 500‚Ä≤s close brought the index just shy of its seventh straight weekly gain, which would have marked its longest winning streak since 2017. The S&amp;P 500 could still soon join the Dow with its own all-time high, however, as the broad market index is less than 2% away from a record close set in January 2022. ***** &gt; Wall Street rallied this week after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday admitted that its efforts to tamp down inflation are taking hold, and indicated three interest rate cuts are coming in 2024, buoying investor sentiment. The November retail sales data that came in stronger than expected on Thursday, following this week‚Äôs cooler inflation readings, added to hopes the Federal Reserve could navigate a soft landing. ***** &gt; That said, New York Fed President John Williams pushed back on the euphoria around the central bank easing rates next year. ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt really talking about rate cuts right now,‚Äù Williams told CNBC‚Äôs Steve Liesman in an interview on Friday. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúStocks got a major sentiment boost from Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting, but that immediate effect was bound to wear off,‚Äù said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E-Trade. ‚ÄúThe market doesn‚Äôt go up every day, no matter how strong a trend is. Pullbacks and pauses are inevitable, regardless of how big they are or how long they last.‚Äù  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #1!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #2!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #3!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #4!](  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](  *****  &gt; # Magnificent Seven Market Cap Round Trip  &gt; At the start of 2022, the seven largest S&amp;P 500 stocks by market cap (which have begun to colloquially be called the Magnificent Seven) possessed a combined market cap of $11.78 trillion. However, severe losses throughout 2022 meant that by the end of the year these stocks were down 47.7% on average. In terms of the combined market cap, that dropped the total down to just $6.9 trillion. In 2023, those same seven stocks have averaged a gain of 106.6%. While not all of these stocks have fully recovered‚Äîfor example, Telsa (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Meta (META) all have lower market caps than at the start of 2022‚Äîthe strong performance this year on the whole has meant the combined market cap has made a round trip. Now back to square one, what‚Äôs next?  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # All About Dow New Highs  &gt; In the face of many worries, stocks have put together a historic year in ‚Äô23. To top things off, the Dow just hit a fresh new all-time high, its first new high since January 4, 2022.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; **New Highs Happen More Than You Think** Interestingly, this marked the 11th consecutive year that the Dow made a new high, the second longest streak ever! Of course, the previous two calendar years have had a total of only four new highs, but it still counts.  &gt; Since 1900 there have been nearly 1,400 new highs, which actually comes out to 4.5% of all days since 1900 closing at a new all-time high. That is probably much more than most people expect.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; **Stocks Lead the Economy** &gt; Since markets are forward looking, stocks tend to lead the economy. This can work on the way up and way down, so for us new highs right now is suggesting the economy is on firm footing heading into ‚Äô24 and a stronger economy (with no recession) could be the play next year.  &gt; Sure, there are always some examples of that ‚Äòfinal new high‚Äô right before trouble (1929, 2000, and 2007), but looking back at history, new highs rarely suggest impending doom right around the corner.  &gt; Since World War II, there were 227 months that saw at least one new high for the Dow. A recession started within a year of one of those months only 26 times, or 11.5% of the time. Compare this with the economy being in a recession 13.9% of the time since WWII and new highs could be a subtle positive sign for the economy next year.  &gt; The last new high for the Dow was nearly two years ago, so what happens after the Dow goes a long time without new high? I found 12 times since WWII it went at least a full year without a new high and then made one, and only twice did the economy fall into a recession within a year of that new high.  &gt; What stood out about those two times was both saw Middle East turmoil and a spike in crude oil, likely contributing to the recession. Given the US now produces more oil than anyone, does it makes sense to bet against history and treat this new high as an exception? Here‚Äôs a tweet I sent on this idea.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; **Now What?** &gt; Plain and simple, new highs aren‚Äôt bearish events. In fact, you tend to see new highs take place during bull markets, with more advances potentially ahead. We‚Äôve been calling this a new bull market for over a year now. As far back as last November we said the lows were in and there would be no recession in 2023 (with many arguing with us the whole way up).  &gt; In fact, here‚Äôs an interview I did six months ago with Scott Wapner on CNBC‚Äôs Closing Bell. When he asked me what my biggest worry was, I said it was that too many people were bearish and weren‚Äôt embracing this bull market.  &gt; So what do new highs mean by the numbers? By itself, a new high doesn‚Äôt appear to signal any warnings. In fact, things look about average after new highs. There are the nearly 1,400 new highs since 1900 and a year later the Dow was up 7.8% on average and higher 70.2% of the time. Compare this with the average year since 1900, which was up 7.4% on average and higher 65% of the time.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; But the Dow‚Äôs long break without a new high until now improves the outlook historically. Looking at those 12 times (since WWII) the Dow went at least one year without a new high and then finally made one, ol‚Äô Papa Dow was higher a year later 10 times and up an average of 14.1% with a very solid median return of 16.4%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Wealth Effect Picks Up Into Christmas  &gt; With just two weekends left to shop before Christmas, US consumers have to be feeling a little more flush than they were just a couple months ago. Back in October, the stock market was in a 10%+ drawdown and interest rates looked like they might never stop going up. Less than two months later, though, the S&amp;P 500 Total Return index is suddenly trading at all-time highs as Treasury yields have plummeted.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Maybe just as important for that "wealth effect" feeling is the huge drop in gas prices that we've seen since late September. Back on September 17th, AAA's national average gas price reading (the cost of a gallon of regular unleaded) hit a 52-week high of $3.88. In the three months since then, there has hardly been a day when gas prices haven't gone down, and just yesterday the price/gallon ticked down to $3.087. That drop took gas prices below the low of $3.096 seen last December 22nd to their lowest levels in more than two and a half years dating back to 6/24/21.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; With the stock market at new highs again and gas prices suddenly approaching a "2-handle," Santa may have a little more room in his gift sack this year!  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](  *****  &gt; # FAANG+ Leaving Newcomers in the Dust  &gt; Both the NYSE FAANG+ Index and Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) have put in place fresh 52-week highs in the past couple of days, however, zooming out, those fresh highs are on different planets. The NYSE FAANG+ index‚Äîcomprised of many mega cap Tech stocks‚Äîis not only at a 52-week high, but it's trading at record highs. Since the pre-COVID market high in February 2020, the FANG+ group is now up 120.1%. As for the IPO ETF, this week's 52-week high only leaves the group at the highest levels since April 2022. Contrary to the all-time high for FAANG+, IPO is still down 51.7% from its February 2021 high and is up a meager 4.7% since pre-COVID. As you can see below, these two traded closely inline with each other in the early days of the post-COVID rally, but FANG+ has left IPO in the dust since the start of 2022.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Bulls Take the Majority  &gt; More and more equity indices are hitting fresh record highs with the S&amp;P 500 within 1.5% of doing the same. Understandably on these moves, investor sentiment has gotten a further boost. Per the latest AAII Investor Sentiment Survey, 51.3% of investors reported as bullish this week. And keep in mind, due to the timing of the survey, that would not have fully captured any investor response to yesterday's FOMC. That is the highest and first reading above 50% since July 20th of this year when bulls were only 0.1 percentage points higher. Outside of that week, it would be the highest bullish sentiment reading since April 2022.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Given the new high in bulls, bears have been nowhere to be found. A meager 19.3% of respondents reported as bearish this week. That surpasses the recent low of 19.6% from just two weeks ago for the lowest amount since the first week of January 2018 when only 15.56% of responses were bearish.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The overwhelmingly bullish sentiment can also be observed through the bull-bear spread. Currently, the share of bulls outnumber bears by 32 percentage points. That is the widest margin in favor of bulls since April 2021. Looked at another way, that is 2.1 standard deviations above the historical average of the spread meaning sentiment is extremely extended..  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The cheery sentiment on the part of investors certainly means there is a warm and fuzzy feeling during this holiday season, but we would note that sentiment is historically a contrarian indicator. In other words, opposite to what investors are feeling, extremely bullish sentiment readings have historically been followed by more lackluster returns.  *****  &gt; # Claims Cooling Down  &gt; Economic data this morning broadly came in healthier than expected, including weekly jobless claims. Initial claims were expected to go unchanged at 220K. While that previous week's reading was revised up to 221K, this week's print fell all the way down to 202K. That is the lowest reading on jobless claims since the week of October 14th and September 16th before that. In all, that makes for one of the lowest readings on claims since January of last year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Before seasonal adjustment, claims are largely following the usual seasonal pattern having been trending higher since the early fall. Currently at 248.3K, unadjusted claims are running at the lowest level for the comparable week of the year since 1969.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Continuing claims have gotten much more elevated than initial claims over the past few months. Currently totaling 1.876 million, continuing claims have risen meaningfully from the low of 1.658 million put in place just three months ago. However, the consistent pace of increases over that span (every week from September 16th through the first week of November saw a week over week increase) has slowed, having been more choppy in the past month. In fact, at 1.876 million, the current reading is still almost 50K below the recent high of 1.925 million set in mid-November.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Moderating Inflation &amp; Final Fed Meeting Clear Path for late-December Surge  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; This week‚Äôs CPI and PPI releases showed the moderating trend of inflation continues. Prices are still rising just at a slower pace and the rate of change could finally fall back before the Fed‚Äôs target of 2% next year. In response to and in anticipation of lower interest rates, the market has enjoyed above average gains in December.  &gt; As of the close on December 12, DJIA was up 1.74%, S&amp;P 500 +1.66%, NASDAQ +2.16% and Russell 2000 up an impressive 3.99% (right side vertical axis of chart above). The market did experience some typical early December weakness this year after bucking the trend of weakness on the first trading day. Even though the market has already enjoyed above average gains this month, we still anticipate more to come with the potential for a new all-time closing high from DJIA before year end.  *****  &gt; # Inflation Still Moving in the Right Direction  &gt; This morning‚Äôs Consumer Price Index for November was mostly in line with expectations (although the headline reading was slightly higher than expected), and the lack of any meaningful surprises has allowed the market to continue with what has lately been the path of least resistance, which has been higher. The report also showed that the most rapid leg of disinflation is most likely behind us, and while that could lead some to believe that the road ahead will be a slog, that isn‚Äôt necessarily the case.  &gt; For starters, the focus of monthly inflation reports lately has been in Core CPI (ex-food and energy). After peaking at 6.6% in June 2022, the November year/year reading came in at 4.0% for the second month in a row.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The chart below shows the historical 12-month rate of change in the y/y core CPI. Over the last 12 months, that rate of increase has declined by two full percentage points, and outside of the prior two months, that is one of the sharpest declines since the early 1980s. In other words, the 12-month rate of change is still declining, but the pace of decline is slowing.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; November‚Äôs streak also ended what has been a monumental streak of monthly declines in the y/y core CPI reading. At seven months in October, it was the second longest streak on record, trailing only the ten-month streak of declines ending in December 1975.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Understandably, the end of the streak of declines along with the slowing rate of decline in the y/y core CPI reading could lead one to think that inflation levels are plateauing at a higher level. However, a look at the trend of monthly prints in core CPI shows a potential tailwind in the months ahead. The chart below shows the monthly change in core CPI over the last 24 months. While it hasn‚Äôt exactly been linear, the trend is lower. In the twelve months from December 2021 through November 2022, eight out of twelve monthly prints were 0.5% or above, but in the last twelve months, only one print has been 0.5%.  &gt; Just looking at the last year (shaded area in chart) it‚Äôs a similar trend. From December 2022 through May 2022, every monthly print was 0.4% or above, but in the most recent six months, every print has been 0.3% or below. If just the trend of the last six months remains in place, for the next six months the y/y reading will be replacing monthly prints of 0.4% or more with prints of 0.3% or less which should help to keep the trend of disinflation going.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Small Business Sentiment Mixed Under the Hood  &gt; The NFIB unveiled its latest look at small business sentiment early this morning. The headline number remains in the bottom decile of its historical range, falling 0.1 points to 90.6 in November. That is compared to expectations which called for the number to be unchanged last month.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Across the categories factoring into the index, breadth was mixed in November with four categories falling, four rising, and one unchanged. Like the headline number, many categories are also in the bottom few percentiles of their respective historical ranges, albeit with some exceptions like robust readings in plans to increase employment, current inventories, and job openings hard to fill.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; As we discussed in our Morning Lineup, combining the report's readings on employment shows some rebounding conditions for labor markets over the past few months. Looking more closely, though, it is hard to say labor market conditions are materially accelerating. As shown, hiring plans have risen, but on net more companies are reporting negative employment changes. In a similar vein, compensation plans have risen sharply including a six point jump month over month in November (the largest one month increase since last October and the third largest on record), even though actual changes to compensation have been flat. Meanwhile, fewer businesses are reporting job openings are hard to fill. Small businesses are showing labor conditions have cooled over the past couple of years but are far from weak as any more recent improvements have been from plans rather than observed changes.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Similarly, sales expectations rebounded in November, contrary to a flat reading on actual sales and earnings changes. Perhaps most importantly, the share of businesses reporting higher prices has fallen down to 25, matching the July low. In combination with the higher reading on sales expectations, that likely helped the number of firms reporting now as a good time to expand.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Looking at the reverse, of those reporting now as not a good time to expand, the single biggest reason given for such sentiment was economic conditions. That is typically the most widely cited reason historically followed by political climate (the NFIB has a tendency to be sensitive to politics, namely which party holds the presidency), but for the first time in at least a decade, financial conditions and interest rates earned the number two spot.

As for the reasons given for lower earnings, increased costs remain a key reason, but November also saw a significant jump in those reporting sales volumes as a problem.

[(4/24) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,;,; # Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, April 24th, 2023-  *****  # [Stock futures fall as Wall Street awaits tech earnings: Live updates]( ***** &gt; Stock futures fell on Monday as investors awaited a slew of corporate earnings from big tech companies, as well as fresh economic data releases. ***** &gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 89 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures dipped 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. ***** &gt; The major indexes all fell last week as the earnings season began to ramp up, with several prominent banking names posting their quarterly results for the first time since the bank failures in March. The Dow dropped 0.23% and ended a four-week winning streak. The Nasdaq declined 0.42%, while the S&amp;P edged down 0.1%. ***** &gt; Roughly 76% of S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported earnings through Friday beat analyst earnings estimates, according to FactSet data. However, first-quarter earnings for S&amp;P 500 companies are estimated to decline an overall 5.2%, per Refinitiv. ***** &gt; Wall Street is looking ahead toward mega-cap tech earnings results this week in what will mark the halfway point of earnings season. Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta are among the high-interest names scheduled to announce their results for the first quarter. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúA lot of these companies took 2022 as an opportunity to dump all the bad stuff into their earnings,‚Äù said Aswath Damodaran, professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell‚Äù on Friday, regarding upcoming tech earnings. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we see a lot of positive surprises coming out of their earnings reports,‚Äù Damodaran added. ***** &gt; Investors are also keeping a close eye out on new economic data that will provide insight into whether inflation is cooling, or if the Federal Reserve will announce another rate hike at its next meeting in early May. GDP numbers for the first quarter, as well as April‚Äôs consumer sentiment data will be released among a flurry of other economic indicators. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúPart of the reason why we‚Äôre so focused on the economic data is we think the investor narrative is still around the Fed and interest rates. And we think the economic reports over the next seven to 10 days are going to be the really big driver of ultimately what the Fed is going to do,‚Äù said Greg Bassuk, CEO of AXS Investments. ***** &gt; Bassuk continued, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre expecting the data, frankly, to be mixed. And we think that‚Äôs going to continue to cause uncertainty and continued volatility. I think, to some extent, the Fed rate hike slowed down the economy. But there‚Äôs still elements where things are still looking pretty robust. Because of that, we‚Äôre thinking that the Fed is likely to do one more rate cut.‚Äù ***** &gt; Coca-Cola and Credit Suisse are set to report earnings Monday before the bell. Whirlpool and First Republic Bank will be announcing their results after Monday‚Äôs trading session. Traders will also watch out for the Dallas Fed‚Äôs Manufacturing survey results to gauge the state of the state‚Äôs factory activity.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](  *****  #LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](  *****  #LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  #THIS AFTERNOON'S AFTER-HOURS EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**) (N/A.)  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  #FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!]( ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!]( ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!]( ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](  *****  #FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](  *****  &gt; **Coca-Cola** ‚Äî Shares of the beverage maker added about 1.4% in early morning trading after the company posted better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter, fueled by price hikes and higher demand.

[Federal Officials Trade Stock in Companies Their Agencies Oversee,;,;   Hidden records show thousands of senior executive branch employees owned shares of companies whose fates were directly affected by their employers‚Äô actions, a Wall Street Journal investigation found  Thousands of officials across the government‚Äôs executive branch reported owning or trading stocks that stood to rise or fall with decisions their agencies made, a Wall Street Journal investigation has found.  More than 2,600 officials at agencies from the Commerce Department to the Treasury Department, during both Republican and Democratic administrations, disclosed stock investments in companies while those same companies were lobbying their agencies for favorable policies. That amounts to more than one in five senior federal employees across 50 federal agencies reviewed by the Journal.  A top official at the Environmental Protection Agency reported purchases of oil and gas stocks. The Food and Drug Administration improperly let an official own dozens of food and drug stocks on its no-buy list. A Defense Department official bought stock in a defense company five times before it won new business from the Pentagon.  The Journal obtained and analyzed more than 31,000 financial-disclosure forms for about 12,000 senior career employees, political staff and presidential appointees. The review spans 2016 through 2021 and includes data on about 850,000 financial assets and more than 315,000 trades reported in stocks, bonds and funds by the officials, their spouses or dependent children.  The vast majority of the disclosure forms aren‚Äôt available online or readily accessible. The review amounts to the most comprehensive analysis of investments held by executive-branch officials, who have wide but largely unseen influence over public policy.   Among the Journal‚Äôs findings:  ‚Ä¢ While the government was ramping up scrutiny of big technology companies, more than 1,800 federal officials reported owning or trading at least one of four major tech stocks: Meta Platforms Inc.‚Äôs Facebook, Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.  ‚Ä¢ More than five dozen officials at five agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, reported trading stock in companies shortly before their departments announced enforcement actions, such as charges and settlements, against those companies.  ‚Ä¢ More than 200 senior EPA officials, nearly one in three, reported investments in companies that were lobbying the agency. EPA employees and their family members collectively owned between $400,000 and nearly $2 million in shares of oil and gas companies on average each year between 2016 and 2021.  ‚Ä¢ At the Defense Department, officials in the office of the secretary reported collectively owning between $1.2 million and $3.4 million of stock in aerospace and defense companies on average each year examined by the Journal. Some held stock in Chinese companies while the U.S. was considering blacklisting the companies.  ‚Ä¢ About 70 federal officials reported using riskier financial techniques such as short selling and options trading, with some individual trades valued at between $5 million and $25 million. In all, the forms revealed more than 90,000 trades of stocks during the six-year period reviewed.  ‚Ä¢ When financial holdings caused a conflict, the agencies sometimes simply waived the rules. In most instances identified by the Journal, ethics officials certified that the employees had complied with the rules, which have several exemptions that allow officials to hold stock that conflicts with their agency‚Äôs work. Number of federal officials who reported owning specific tech stocks, 2016-21  Federal agency officials, many of them unknown to the public, wield ‚Äúimmense power and influence over things that impact the day-to-day lives of everyday Americans, such as public health and food safety, diplomatic relations and regulating trade,‚Äù said Don Fox, an ethics lawyer and former general counsel at the U.S. agency that oversees conflict-of-interest rules.  He said many of the examples in the Journal analysis ‚Äúclearly violate the spirit behind the law, which is to maintain the public‚Äôs confidence in the integrity of the government.‚Äù  Some federal officials use investment advisers who direct their stock trading, but such trades still can create conflicts under the law. ‚ÄúThe buck stops with the official,‚Äù said Kathleen Clark, a law professor and former ethics lawyer for the Washington, D.C., government. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the official who could benefit or be harmed‚Ä¶. That can occur regardless of who made the trade.‚Äù  Investing by federal agency officials has drawn far less public attention than that of lawmakers. Congress has long faced criticism for not prohibiting lawmakers from working on matters in which they have a financial interest. The rules were tightened in 2012 by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, passed following a series of Journal articles on congressional trading abuses.  Journal reporting last year on federal judges, revealing that more than 130 jurists heard cases in which they had a financial interest, led to a law passed this May requiring judges to promptly post online any stock trades they make.  This article launches a Journal series on the financial holdings of senior executive-branch employees and, in some instances, conflicts of interest hidden in their disclosure forms.  U.S. law prohibits federal officials from working on any matters that could affect their personal finances. Additional regulations adopted in 1992 direct federal employees to avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest.  The 1978 Ethics in Government Act requires senior federal employees above a certain pay level to file annual financial disclosures listing their income, assets and loans. The financial figures are reported in broad dollar ranges. image A view of Washington, D.C.  Most officials‚Äô financial disclosures are public only upon request. The Journal obtained disclosure forms by filing written requests with each federal agency.  Some made it difficult to obtain the forms, and several agencies haven‚Äôt turned over all of them. The Department of Homeland Security hasn‚Äôt provided any financial records. (See an accompanying article on methodology.)  Under federal regulations, investments of $15,000 or less in individual stocks aren‚Äôt considered potential conflicts, nor are holdings of $50,000 or less in mutual funds that focus on a specific industry. The law doesn‚Äôt restrict investing in diversified funds.  Some federal officials, especially those at the most senior levels, sell all their individual stocks when they enter the government to avoid the appearance of a conflict.  The Office of Government Ethics, which oversees the conflict-of-interest rules across the executive branch, is ‚Äúcommitted to transparency and citizen oversight of government,‚Äù said a spokeswoman. She said the agency publishes financial disclosures of the most senior officials on its website, along with instructions for getting disclosures from other agencies.  At the EPA, an official named Michael Molina and his husband owned oil and gas stocks while Mr. Molina was serving as senior adviser to the deputy EPA administrator, according to agency records. Such companies stood to benefit from former President Donald Trump‚Äôs pledge to promote energy production by rolling back environmental regulations and speeding up projects.  Mr. Molina‚Äôs job gave him a front-row seat to deliberations about environmental regulations relating to energy. He ‚Äúreviews and coordinates sensitive reports, documents and other materials,‚Äù said his job description, provided by the EPA in response to a public-records request. He served as a ‚Äúpersonal and confidential representative‚Äù of the EPA deputy administrator in communications with the White House and Congress, according to the job description.  In the month he started the job, May 2018, Mr. Molina reported purchases totaling between $16,002 and $65,000 of stock in Cheniere Energy Inc., a leading producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. He reported adding Cheniere stock five additional times over the next year. At the time, senior EPA officials were encouraging the production of natural gas in the U.S.  Reported trades in energy and mining firms;  made by spouse through a financial adviser  The trades were made through a financial adviser in his husband‚Äôs account, according to emails and disclosure forms reviewed by the Journal. Mr. Molina was required to enter the trades into the EPA‚Äôs electronic-disclosure system within 30 days of receiving notice of the transactions, under the 2012 STOCK Act.  Officials are responsible for ensuring that their holdings don‚Äôt conflict with their work, regardless of whether they use a financial adviser. The Journal‚Äôs review of disclosures shows that many federal officials tell their financial advisers to avoid investing in certain industries or to shed specific stocks.  In an interview on Sept. 28, Mr. Molina indicated that he didn‚Äôt know much about the energy trades. ‚ÄúI can say this on the record: I didn‚Äôt even know what Cheniere was until 36 hours ago,‚Äù he said.  In February 2019, Mr. Molina was promoted to EPA deputy chief of staff. He attended scores of meetings on environmental issues, reviewed matters for the then-head of the agency, Andrew Wheeler, and was sometimes asked his opinions in meetings, according to records reviewed by the Journal and people familiar with the matter.  In about 2¬Ω years at the EPA, Mr. Molina reported more than 100 trades in energy and mining companies including Duke Energy Corp., NextEra Energy Inc. and BP PLC. About 20 of the transactions were for between $15,001 and $50,000 each, according to Mr. Molina‚Äôs disclosures. Those trades also were made for his husband by his financial adviser.  In the month he was promoted, February 2019, his husband made several stock purchases through the adviser in Cheniere and Williams Cos., which builds and operates natural-gas pipelines.  Two months later, Mr. Trump said the EPA would propose new rules to help the gas industry.  After publication of this article, Mr. Molina said in a written statement: ‚ÄúNeither I nor my husband knew about or directed any of these trades. Our financial advisor had complete discretion to trade in the account, and these same trades were made on behalf of a ‚Äòpool‚Äô of several dozen clients‚Äînot for us individually.‚Äù  Mr. Molina left the EPA in January 2021. An EPA spokeswoman said the agency‚Äôs ethics office ‚Äúcounseled Mr. Molina on his ethics and financial disclosure obligations.‚Äù EPA officials signed Mr. Molina‚Äôs financial-disclosure statement in each year he worked at the agency, an indication they believed he was in compliance with the conflict-of-interest rules.  U.S. law leaves it to individual agencies to decide whether they need rules to beef up the federal conflict-of-interest law. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission explicitly bars its officials from investing in natural gas, interstate oil pipeline, utility and other energy firms.  The EPA doesn‚Äôt have additional agencywide rules. A spokeswoman for the EPA said its officials may invest in energy companies so long as they aren‚Äôt working on policies that could affect their investments. Mr. Molina‚Äôs boss told ethics officials that he had no influence over public policy matters.  Greg Zacharias was the chief scientist for the Defense Department‚Äôs director of operational test and evaluation until last fall. He repeatedly bought stock in a defense contractor in the weeks before the Pentagon announced it would pay the company $1 billion to deliver more F-35 combat jets, while his division was overseeing testing of those planes.  Mr. Zacharias made five purchases of Lockheed Martin Corp. stock, collectively worth $20,700, in August and September 2021, according to figures he provided. On Sept. 24, 2021, the Defense Department said it was buying 16 F-35 jets from Lockheed for the Air Force and Marine Corps. Lockheed shares closed up 1.1% the next trading day. The stock made up a small part of Mr. Zacharias‚Äôs portfolio.  Mr. Zacharias‚Äôs office had been involved for years in overseeing testing of combat jets, and testing officials regularly met with the Pentagon‚Äôs F-35 Joint Program Office and with Lockheed directly, according to former defense officials. Mr. Zacharias, who provided scientific and technical expertise on how to assess the effectiveness of weapons systems, didn‚Äôt attend those meetings.  In an interview, Mr. Zacharias said he wasn‚Äôt involved in decisions on contracting and had no inside knowledge ahead of the contract, beyond the public information that the Pentagon remained committed to the F-35 program. He acknowledged that his role could have allowed him to access information about specific weapons systems. ‚ÄúI could always walk downstairs and ask them how it‚Äôs going. But that really wasn‚Äôt an interest of mine,‚Äù he said, adding that his focus was emerging technologies.  Mr. Zacharias said he wanted to buy stock in defense contractors, including Lockheed, because of their dominance of the defense market. He said he didn‚Äôt pay much attention to the timing of trades, adding: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just the pipe-smoking science guy.‚Äù  The Lockheed investments were among more than 50 trades Mr. Zacharias reported in about a half-dozen defense contractors in 2020 and 2021, according to the Journal‚Äôs analysis.  ‚ÄúI apologize that things don‚Äôt look good on the buy side,‚Äù Mr. Zacharias added. Of the trades in defense contractors, he said: ‚ÄúI just decided that would be a good investment at the time.‚Äù  He said ethics officials didn‚Äôt raise concerns about his trades in Lockheed or any of the other defense contractors he reported investments in, beyond periodically sending a letter reminding him not to take part in contract negotiations involving the companies. He said ethics rules could be ‚Äúa little tighter.‚Äù  A Pentagon spokeswoman said Mr. Zacharias ‚Äúworked with his supervisor and ethics officials to implement appropriate disqualifications.‚Äù She said the department requires supervisors to screen their employees‚Äô disclosures for conflicts in addition to the review conducted by ethics officials. Ethics officials certified that he complied with the law.  Some conflicts of interest stemmed from agencies‚Äô misunderstanding of their own rules.  The FDA prohibits employees, their spouses and their minor children from investing in companies that are ‚Äúsignificantly regulated‚Äù by the agency. The FDA maintains an online list of the prohibited companies for officials to check.  An FDA official named Malcolm Bertoni disclosed that he and his wife owned stock in about 70 pharmaceutical, diagnostics, medical device and food companies regulated by the agency in 2018 and 2019, including drug giants Pfizer Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. All were on the prohibited list.  Mr. Bertoni, a career executive, ran the FDA‚Äôs planning office from 2008 to 2019, researching and analyzing agency programs. Most of the investments he reported were in the range of $1,001 to $15,000, but his 2019 disclosure showed he and his wife owned between $15,001 and $50,000 in each of Allergan PLC, Sanofi SA, Takeda and Zoetis Inc.  Mr. Bertoni‚Äôs lawyer, Charles Borden, said Mr. Bertoni and his wife held these stocks despite the bans because they got bad advice from the FDA ethics office.  The stocks were in accounts managed by professionals who had discretion to trade without the knowledge of Mr. Bertoni or his wife, the attorney said. He said that years ago, Mr. Bertoni asked the ethics office how he should treat the accounts and was told they fell into an exception to the rules for mutual funds.  They did not. The ethics office discovered its error in a routine review of Mr. Bertoni‚Äôs forms in early 2019, Mr. Borden said. ‚ÄúThe FDA‚Äôs Office of Ethics and Integrity took full responsibility for the inaccurate guidance given to Mr. Bertoni,‚Äù the attorney said in an email.  After considering the tax and retirement-planning consequences of having to sell the stocks, and other personal factors, Mr. Bertoni chose to retire instead, his lawyer said.  An FDA spokesman said Mr. Bertoni was recused from matters involving the companies once he reported his family‚Äôs holdings in them. The spokesman declined to comment on the events leading up to his departure.  ‚ÄúThe FDA takes seriously its obligation to help ensure that decisions made, and actions taken, by the agency and its employees, are not, nor appear to be, tainted by any question of conflict of interest,‚Äù said the spokesman.  When federal officials are found to have violated conflicts rules and are referred to criminal authorities, they often receive light punishment if any, according to records reviewed by the Journal.  Valerie Hardy-Mahoney, a lawyer who runs the National Labor Relations Board‚Äôs Oakland, Calif.-based regional office, held Tesla Inc. shares as her office pursued complaints against the auto maker and Chief Executive Elon Musk and considered whether to file more.  Members of the labor relations board, appointed by the president, review decisions made by agency administrative courts. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney acts as a prosecutor in those courts. She is a career employee who joined the NLRB in the 1980s.  Ms. Hardy-Mahoney‚Äôs office filed complaints against Tesla in 2017 and 2018. She reported holding Tesla shares worth $1,001 to $15,000 in 2019 while those cases were ongoing. The next year, her disclosure form shows, she owned Tesla shares valued at between $30,002 and $100,000 in E*Trade accounts. She purchased two chunks of Tesla stock in August 2020, each valued at between $1,001 and $15,000, according to her disclosure form.  The NLRB ruled in March 2021 that Tesla had illegally fired an employee involved in union organizing and that Mr. Musk, in a tweet, had coerced employees by threatening them with the loss of stock options if they unionized. It ordered Tesla to reinstate the employee and Mr. Musk to delete the tweet. Tesla has disputed the findings and has appealed the decision to a federal appeals court.  Ms. Hardy-Mahoney‚Äôs office has in other cases rejected charges against Tesla filed by employees, including allegations her office received in 2020, after she bought more Tesla stock, according to an NLRB case docket. An employee who worked at the Tesla Gigafactory alleged that the company interfered with workers‚Äô rights. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney‚Äôs office dismissed the charge in January 2021.  Last November, an NLRB ethics official declined to certify that Ms. Hardy-Mahoney was in compliance with ethics laws and regulations, according to her disclosure form.  The NLRB‚Äôs inspector general said in a report that his office had substantiated an allegation of violating federal law by participating in a matter in which an employee had a financial interest. An agency spokeswoman confirmed that the report involved Ms. Hardy-Mahoney.  The report said that the matter was referred to the local U.S. attorney‚Äôs office, but that federal prosecutors declined to take it. The report said the subject of the report‚ÄîMs. Hardy-Mahoney‚Äîreceived additional training regarding financial conflicts of interest and the case was closed.  Ms. Hardy-Mahoney declined to comment. She recused herself from Tesla cases last year and now is in compliance with conflict-of-interest rules, the NLRB spokeswoman said.  At the Federal Reserve, an economist named Min Wei reported trades in stock of a marijuana company after the Fed sought clarity about whether banks could serve cannabis businesses. A Fed spokeswoman said the trades were made by Ms. Wei‚Äôs husband.  In June 2018, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said publicly that the issue put the central bank ‚Äúin a very, very difficult position.‚Äù Even though its mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, Mr. Powell said, he ‚Äújust would love to see‚Äù a clear policy on the matter.  Because Mr. Powell didn‚Äôt dismiss the idea, investors saw the comment as bullish for cannabis companies such as Tilray Brands Inc., a leading producer. Tilray went public the following month, and its stock skyrocketed.  In early September 2018, Ms. Wei‚Äôs husband bought between $480,005 and $1.1 million of Tilray shares, according to her disclosure form and the Fed. The stock continued to surge.  It then became clear that neither the Fed nor the Treasury would take action; it would be up to Congress, with no quick fix in sight. In October, shares of cannabis companies began to fall.  Ms. Wei‚Äôs husband sold his Tilray stake in five sales in early October. By then, the shares had nearly doubled, worth between $800,005 and $1.75 million, according to Ms. Wei‚Äôs disclosure.  The Fed imposed new restrictions this year on investing by bank presidents, Fed board governors and senior staff after the Journal reported questionable trading by presidents of two Fed banks, who subsequently resigned. The new rules prohibit trading individual stocks and bonds and require that trades, even in mutual funds, be preapproved and prescheduled.  The new Fed rules for top people don‚Äôt apply to Ms. Wei because she isn‚Äôt senior enough. The trades were ‚Äúpermissible then and are permissible now,‚Äù said the Fed spokeswoman.  Ms. Wei referred questions to the Fed. The spokeswoman said Ms. Wei had ‚Äúno responsibility or involvement with policy decisions related to bank supervision or the provision of banking services.‚Äù She said the Fed ‚Äúdid not assert any interest at the time in the Federal Reserve resolving the conflict between federal and state law in the area of cannabis companies and their access to banking services, but rather pointed out that the appropriate resolution of those issues should come from the Congress.‚Äù  Ethics lawyers said trading such large amounts of an individual stock while the Fed is publicly addressing an issue creates an appearance problem, even if Ms. Wei‚Äôs trades didn‚Äôt violate conflicts rules. image The Federal Reserve building in Washington.  Roughly seven dozen federal officials reported more than 500 financial transactions apiece over the six-year period analyzed by the Journal. Some traded a single stock frequently, while others reported hundreds or even thousands of trades across a broad array of stocks, bonds and funds.  In one instance, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission permitted short sales contrary to one of the CFTC‚Äôs own rules.  The financial disclosure of Lihong McPhail, an economist at the CFTC, showed the most trading reported by any federal official in the Journal‚Äôs review. Her husband made more than 9,500 trades in 2020‚Äîan average of about 38 each trading day, according to her disclosure form and the CFTC.  About one-third of those reported 2020 trades‚Äî2,994‚Äîinvolved shorting stocks, or betting on a fall in their price. They ranged from Amazon to Ford Motor Co. to Zoom Video Communications Inc. The CFTC said all the short sales were made by her husband.  Over the years, to safeguard the CFTC‚Äôs integrity, Congress imposed tighter restrictions than at other agencies on employees‚Äô investing. In amending the Commodity Exchange Act, Congress also declared that any breach by a CFTC employee of an investment rule set by the commission could be punishable by up to a $500,000 fine and five years in prison. The CFTC‚Äôs role doesn‚Äôt include regulating stocks, but in 2002, the agency adopted a rule banning short selling by its employees and their families.  Nonetheless, a CFTC ethics official approved short selling by Ms. McPhail‚Äôs husband, Joseph McPhail, a CFTC spokesman said, fearing that the commission ‚Äúcould possibly be sued by the employee if we said no.‚Äù The spokesman said the ethics office believed the regulatory provision exceeded the commission‚Äôs statutory authority.  Mr. McPhail referred questions to the CFTC. The CFTC spokesman said he didn‚Äôt speak for the McPhails. Ms. McPhail didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment.  At the CFTC, ‚Äúemployees are required by statute and by regulations to adhere to strict ethical standards and to disclose personal investments to ensure that the work of the CFTC to oversee markets is free from any conflict of interest,‚Äù said the agency spokesman. ‚ÄúIn this instance, several years ago the employee sought advice regarding their spouse‚Äôs investments and received approval from career ethics counsel.‚Äù  Mr. McPhail was a senior policy analyst at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. until September 2021. In a written statement, that agency said: ‚ÄúThe FDIC expects our employees, as public servants, to devote their time and efforts to our mission to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation‚Äôs banking system.‚Äù  The Defense Department was among the federal agencies with the most officials who invested in Chinese stocks, even as the Pentagon in recent years has shifted its focus to countering China.  Across the federal government, more than 400 officials owned or traded Chinese company stocks, including officials at the State Department and White House, the Journal found. Their investments amounted to between $1.9 million and $6.6 million on average a year.  Reed Werner, while serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense for south and southeast Asia, in December 2020 reported a purchase of between $15,001 and $50,000 of stock in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  At the time, discussions were under way at the Pentagon over whether to add the Chinese e-commerce giant to a list of companies in which Americans were barred from investing because of their alleged ties to the Chinese government.  Defense and State officials pushed to add the company to the blacklist, while the Treasury feared this would have wide capital-markets ramifications. Mr. Werner had been involved over a period of months in some discussions about what companies to add to the blacklist, former defense officials said.  Nearly two weeks after the Alibaba purchase, the Treasury updated its list and didn‚Äôt include Alibaba. The company‚Äôs stock rose 4% that day.  Three days later, Mr. Werner‚Äôs financial-disclosure form shows a sale of between $15,001 and $50,000 of Alibaba stock.  The sale came a day before a meeting where defense officials planned to press their case for adding Alibaba and two other companies to the blacklist. Then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ultimately blocked the effort.  In an interview, Mr. Werner acknowledged he was involved in discussions about adding Alibaba to the list, saying he attended a meeting in late 2020 and was on an email chain about the matter. He said that he wasn‚Äôt involved in blacklist discussions during the period the Alibaba trades were made, and that the trades resulted in a $1,556.51 gain. He declined to answer further questions.  The Pentagon spokeswoman said that the officials who formally compiled and approved the blacklist didn‚Äôt own stock in affected companies, and that supervisors and ethics officials review reports for holdings that could conflict with an employee‚Äôs duties. Ethics officials certified that Mr. Werner complied with the law.  At least 15 other defense officials in the office of the secretary reported that they or family members owned or traded Alibaba between 2016 and 2021, including Jack Wilmer, who served as senior cybersecurity adviser at the White House and then as the Pentagon‚Äôs top cybersecurity official.  Between 2018 and 2020, Mr. Wilmer reported at least six trades, which he said totaled around $10,000, in the Chinese companies Alibaba, search-engine giant Baidu Inc. and China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp.  Mr. Wilmer said that a money manager handles his trades and that he didn‚Äôt direct any of those transactions. He said he wasn‚Äôt involved in policy-making decisions that would have affected those stocks and said he didn‚Äôt see a conflict between his job and investments. He left the government in July 2020, before Mr. Trump signed the executive order barring Americans from investing in certain Chinese companies.  Within federal agencies, ethics officials generally don‚Äôt consider it their job to investigate whether employees are making stock trades based on information they glean from their government jobs. Ethics officials‚Äô ability to spot potential conflicts is limited because they usually don‚Äôt know what employees are working on.  When ethics officials do see a potential violation, they can refer it to their agencies‚Äô inspectors general, who refer cases on to the Justice Department if they find evidence of wrongdoing.  A Journal review of inspector general reports showed that the offices rarely investigated financial conflicts. As more federal officials invest in the stock market, ethics officials say they have less time to look into possible wrongdoing. When findings have been referred to the Justice Department, prosecutors in most cases have declined to open an investigation.  One matter at the Securities and Exchange Commission involved an official who failed to report or clear his and his spouse‚Äôs financial holdings and trades for at least seven years. The trades included stocks that SEC employees and their families weren‚Äôt allowed to own, some of which the SEC inspector general determined posed a conflict with the official‚Äôs work, according to a report the inspector general provided to Congress.  When a U.S. attorney declined to prosecute, the SEC‚Äôs inspector general reported the findings to SEC management. The unnamed official ultimately was suspended for seven days and gave up 16 hours of leave time.  The SEC declined to comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on individual investigations but said: ‚ÄúWe take all inspector general referrals seriously and bring charges when the facts and law support them, consistent with the principles of federal prosecution.‚Äù Share Your Thoughts  Are stock trading rules for federal officials OK or should they be further restricted? Join the conversation below.  Most federal agencies don‚Äôt have protocols to verify that officials‚Äô financial disclosures are complete. One Agriculture Department official disclosed wheat, corn and soybean futures and options trades. The Journal discovered that he had made additional large trades in corn and soybean futures in 2018 and 2019 and omitted them from his reports.  The official, Clare Carlson, who is no longer at the USDA, said that he tried to be scrupulous in his disclosures, and that the omissions were honest mistakes. The Agriculture Department declined to comment.  At the EPA, Mr. Molina‚Äôs financial-disclosure reporting caught the attention of ethics officials.  The conflict-of-interest rules say executive-branch employees may not ‚Äúparticipate personally and substantially‚Äù in matters that have a ‚Äúdirect and predictable effect‚Äù on their investments and those of family members.  When the ethics officials contacted Mr. Molina about energy stocks he reported on his forms, they were told he didn‚Äôt have any influence over environmental policy.  His ‚Äúduties are administrative in nature,‚Äù his boss, the EPA‚Äôs chief of staff at the time, told the ethics officials. ‚ÄúHe provides logistical support to the principal but does not participate personally and substantially in making any decisions, recommendations or advice that will have any direct or substantial effect‚Äù on his financial interests, the chief of staff said, according to Mr. Molina‚Äôs financial disclosure.  In his time at the EPA, Mr. Molina clashed with ethics officials. Many of his financial disclosure reports were inaccurate and tardy, according to EPA emails reviewed by the Journal. At one point, he didn‚Äôt file accurate monthly trading disclosures for 12 months, according to the EPA emails. Mr. Molina reported the stock trades on his annual financial reports, as required.  Ethics officials said they contacted Mr. Molina ‚Äúscores‚Äù of times to press him to file timely reports, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.  In one email, a senior ethics official said his office had ‚Äúprovided you with at least 3-5 times more personal assistance than for any other agency employee, yet the required ethics reports were still late.‚Äù  Mr. Molina told EPA officials that he initially didn‚Äôt know he was supposed to complete regular stock-trading reports. He later struggled to keep up with the EPA‚Äôs electronic-disclosure system, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.  In September 2020, the EPA fined Mr. Molina $3,200 for numerous failures to disclose stock trades to the agency on time. Mr. Molina refused to pay.  ‚ÄúWe have never before had an employee refuse to pay the late fee,‚Äù wrote one ethics officer in an email to Mr. Molina on Oct. 21, 2020, ‚Äúso I will have to inquire about how to commence garnishment proceedings.‚Äù  The next month, Mr. Molina accused ethics officials of discriminating against him. ‚ÄúI feel that I am being targeted and have been asked to report more than anyone else,‚Äù he wrote in a Nov. 3, 2020, email.  ‚ÄúIf the intent of these filings is to curb any corruption or misbehavior,‚Äù Mr. Molina wrote, the EPA should open an investigation. ‚ÄúI believe that paying such an outrageous fine would be an admission that I have done something wrong in this regard.‚Äù  Ethics officials didn‚Äôt investigate Mr. Molina‚Äôs trades or refer the matter to internal investigators.  On the evening of Jan. 19, 2021, Mr. Molina‚Äôs final day working for the government, EPA ethics officials offered to end the matter if he paid a discounted fine of $1,067.  Mr. Molina wrote out a personal check to ‚ÄúU.S. Treasury‚Äù and sent it to officials in the EPA‚Äôs ethics office, including to Justina Fugh, an official with whom he had clashed.,;,; 2023-05-09 11:47:25]
[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 1st, 2023,;,; Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this month, and are ready for the new trading month of May. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 1st, 2023.  # **Dow gains more than 250 points Friday as index finishes best month since January: Live updates - [(Source)]( ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on Friday, notching its best month since January. ***** &gt; The blue-chip index closed 272 points, or 0.8%, higher at 34,098.16. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.83% to finish at 4,169.48. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.69% to end at 12,226.58 as investors parsed the latest crop of technology earnings. ***** &gt; The Dow finished April 2.5% higher, its best monthly showing since January, when the average ended up 2.8%. The S&amp;P 500 logged a 1.5% monthly gain ‚Äî its second positive month in a row ‚Äî while the Nasdaq ended the month only slightly higher. ***** &gt; On a weekly basis, the Nasdaq saw the largest gain, at 1.3%, in what was considered Big Tech‚Äôs marquee earnings week. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 each finished the week about 0.9% higher. ***** &gt; Just over half of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported earnings thus far. Of those companies, 80% have beaten expectations, according to data from FactSet. That beat rate is roughly in line with a three-year average, according to data from The Earnings Scout. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe market should follow earnings,‚Äù said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management. ‚ÄúThat is the mother‚Äôs milk of the market.‚Äù ***** &gt; Amazon shares closed down nearly 4%. When reporting first-quarter results, the online retailer said its cloud business decelerated, though it did beat Wall Street‚Äôs expectations for revenue in the quarter. ***** &gt; Snap tumbled 17% following a revenue miss. Pinterest shares dropped 15.7% after issuing disappointing second-quarter revenue growth expectations. First Solar slid more than 9% after missing Wall Street expectations for the first quarter. ***** &gt; Not every tech stock was down following their respective releases. Intel shares climbed 4% after the semiconductor firm beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. ***** &gt; Data released Friday morning showed the personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.3% in March, which was in line with economist expectations. The index is a key gauge of inflation for the Federal Reserve, which has a policy meeting scheduled for next week. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúToday is reflective of sort of a three-legged stool,‚Äù said Greg Bassuk, CEO of AXS Investments. ‚ÄúEarnings, economic data and the Fed continue to be the investor narrative.‚Äù ***** &gt; Also of note, shares of troubled First Republic Bank plunged more than 43% after CNBC‚Äôs David Faber reported that the most likely outcome for the regional bank is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation taking receivership. The stock has lost more than 97% of its value since the start of the year.  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](   *****  &gt; # Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Sell In May  &gt; Buckle up, as one of the most well-known investment axioms is nearly here, the ‚ÄòSell in May and Go Away‚Äô period, otherwise known as Sell in May. This gets a ton of play in the media, as these six months are indeed the worst six-month combo out of all scenarios, while stocks also did quite poorly last year during this timeframe as well, only adding to the likely hype.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The thinking is you are better off to simply ignore these six months and go away. Turns out, from May through October the S&amp;P 500 is historically quite weak, up only 1.7% on average and higher less than 65% of the time, making it indeed the worst combo.  &gt; Of course, 1.7% is still a positive return, so maybe we shouldn‚Äôt just blindly go away? That is our take and there are other reasons not to fear these worst six months in 2023. Sure, more volatility and scary headlines could happen, but with overall market sentiment extremely bearish and the economy on firmer footing than most think, we‚Äôd use any seasonal weakness as an opportunity to add to core positions.  &gt; Here‚Äôs something I bet most investors don‚Äôt know, May has been really strong lately for stocks, higher an incredible nine of the past 10 years. Maybe we should call it Sell in June?  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Let‚Äôs take a closer look at that one year over the past decade that stocks fell in May. Turns out, one potential hiccup is May is the second worst month of the year for stocks during a pre-election year, with only September worse. In fact, these are the only two months with a negative return during a pre-election year, with May down 0.1% and September down 0.7%. Even in the bullish 2019 (when stocks gained close to 30%), stocks still lost more than 6% in May of that year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Last year was a great time to sell and go away during these historically weak six months, but that wasn‚Äôt always the case. In fact, over the past decade, stocks only fell twice these six months, last year and 2015. Looking at the past decade shows that these six months have been up nearly 5% on average versus the 1.7% return going back to 1950.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; We‚Äôve noted many times the past several months how historically strong pre-election years were for stocks, well, what about Sell in May in a pre-election year? As you can see below, the returns are right about average, up 1.8% during these six months in a pre-election year. What stands out more to me is how poorly these six months are during a midterm year, playing out well last year for sure.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Now here‚Äôs where things get quite interesting. It turns out how things are going heading into these six months can often give a clue what might happen. When stocks are down year-to-date heading into these six months the return drops to 2.3% and is higher less than a coinflip of the time. Given this was the scenario last year, along with a midterm year, maybe a rough time wasn‚Äôt such a surprise? Now the good news is when stocks are up for the year (like 2023), these worst six months actually gained more than 4% on average and were higher more than 75% of the time. This could bode well for potentially better returns these six months in 2023.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # May‚Äôs First Trading Day: S&amp;P 500 Higher 72% of the Time  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Next Monday, the first trading day of May, has a bullish history over the past 25 years. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have all averaged around 0.4% on the day. S&amp;P 500 has the best track record, up 18 times or 72% of the time since 1998. With an average gain of 0.22%, Russell 2000 is slightly weaker. May‚Äôs first trading day‚Äôs worst loss was in 2020. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 shed over 2.5% while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 dropped over 3%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](    *****  &gt; # "Big" Winners  &gt; Whenever you see a list of best-performing stocks, it‚Äôs inevitably loaded with many small stocks that most investors have never heard of. This year, though, it‚Äôs practically been the opposite trend as the two top performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 on a YTD basis ‚Äì Meta Platforms (+96%) and Nvidia (+88%)- are not only household names but they also have market caps of more than $500 billion. We‚Äôd also note that both stocks are also more than 30 percentage points ahead of the next closest stocks in terms of top YTD returns.  &gt; With such strong returns among the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500, the YTD performance spread between the market-cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 and its equal-weighted counterpart is among the widest ever seen on a YTD basis through the end of April. Through Friday afternoon, the market-cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 was up 8.26% while the equal-weighted index was up just 2.13%. At 6.14 percentage points, the YTD performance gap between the two indices is the second widest since 1990 trailing only the 6.8% percentage point gap in 2020. Besides 2020, the only other year where the gap was wider than two percentage points was in 1997. While it‚Äôs a small sample size and history doesn‚Äôt always repeat itself, we‚Äôd note that the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs rest-of-year performance was a gain of over 20% in both of those years. Just saying.  &gt; Besides the two other years where the performance gap was significantly wide like this year, what stands out about the chart below is how common it has historically been for the market cap-weighted index to underperform the equal weight index in the first four months of the year. Including this year, the cap-weighted index has only outperformed nine times in the last 34 years.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # 10 Weeks of Bearish Sentiment  &gt; As the S&amp;P 500 broke down to the lowest levels of April this week, bullish sentiment according to the weekly AAII survey came in at a new short-term low. After rising to 27.2% last week, only 24.1% of respondents reported as bullish this week, the lowest reading since the end of March.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; That resulted in rising bearish sentiment which rose 3.4 percentage points to 38.5%. Conversely, to bullish sentiment, that is the highest reading since the end of March.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; With inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment, the bull-bear spread has fallen deeper into negative territory meaning bears continue to outnumber bulls, and by a wider margin, although nowhere near the degree as levels seen in 2022.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; As we noted throughout 2022 and earlier this year, bears have consistently outnumbered bulls. In fact, this week marked the tenth in a row in which the bull-bear spread was negative. While that is one of only a handful of other streaks lasting for ten or more weeks going back through the history of the survey, it comes on the back of the record 44-week streak that ended this past February. That was only shortly after another 12-week streak ending in March of last year and the second longest streak on record (34 weeks long) that ended in the fall of 2020. In other words, the story remains in which sentiment has been unshakably bearish.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Some Improvement in Claims  &gt; The latest week's jobless claims data fell down to 230K from the previous week's upward revision to 246K. That 16K decline was the largest week over week drop since the first week of the month and brings claims back down to the low end of the past couple of months' range.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Before seasonal adjustment, claims were lower reaching 225.84K. That is roughly inline with the comparable weeks of last year and the few years prior to the pandemic. As shown in the second chart below, a drop in the current week of the year has very much been the norm historically. As for 2023 as a whole, unadjusted claims have remained relatively flat following the steep seasonal decline in the first weeks of the year. The potential for further seasonal strength will remain in place for the next few weeks as claims historically have reached a seasonal low in late May.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Like initial claims, seasonally adjusted continuing claims also surprised with a decline this week. Continuing claims totaled 1.858 million in the most recent week, down from 1.865 million and better than the expected increase to 1.87 million. Albeit the latest week's reading was surprisingly strong, the indicator's uptrend remains firmly in place which as we noted in last week's Bespoke Report, the overall rise in continuing claims has resembled other recessionary periods.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # S&amp;P 500 April Loss Historically Bearish for Rest of Year  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; April has been the second-best performing S&amp;P 500 month since 1950 based upon average percent gain. As of today‚Äôs close, S&amp;P 500 is down 1.3% this April. Should S&amp;P 500 close out April in the red, the outlook for the balance of the year diminishes notably. In the included table all S&amp;P 500 down Aprils since 1950 appear. Performance in May, during the ‚ÄúWorst Six Months‚Äù (May to October), the rest of the year, and the full year is also included.  &gt; When comparing S&amp;P 500 down Aprils to all Aprils and positive Aprils there historically has been a sizable reduction in average performance and frequency of gains following a down April. Average performance for the rest of the year after a down April was a loss of 0.49% compared to a gain of 7.30% after an up April and 5.06% after all Aprils. Full year S&amp;P 500 performance also dropped significantly following a down April, ‚Äì1.36% versus 13.31% in years with a positive April. But, with two trading days left, there is still a chance S&amp;P 500 avoids an April loss.  *****  &gt; # May Almanac: Second Worst S&amp;P 500 Month in Pre-Election Years  &gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 ‚Äúflash crash‚Äù. It used to be part of what we once called the ‚ÄúMay/June disaster area.‚Äù From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.  &gt; In the years since 1997, May‚Äôs performance has been erratic; DJIA up fourteen times in the past twenty-five years (four of the years had gains exceeding 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down ‚Äì11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains of 2.5% or better and seven losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010 followed by another substantial loss of 7.9% in 2019.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Since 1950, pre-election-year Mays rank poorly, #10 DJIA, #11 S&amp;P 500, #8 NASDAQ, #8 Russell 1000 and #7 Russell 2000. Historically bullish pre-election forces do not consistently lift May. Four of the nine S&amp;P 500 pre-election year May declines exceeded 4%, the worst was a 6.6% loss in 2019. Russell 2000 gained 10.6% in May 2003, notably boosting its average gain and ranking.  *****  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; (*T.B.A.*)  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  &gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).  &gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  # DISCUSS!

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning July 3rd, 2023,;,; Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week, month, quarter and H2 ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 3rd, 2023.  # **S&amp;P 500 rises on Friday to close out big first half, Nasdaq posts best start to a year in 4 decades: Live updates - [(Source)]( ***** &gt; The S&amp;P 500 rose slightly Friday, touching the 4,300 level for the first time since August 2022 as investors looked ahead to upcoming inflation data and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest policy announcement. ***** &gt; Stocks rose Friday and technology names continued their staggering run to cap off a strong start to the year, and the best first half for the Nasdaq Composite since 1983. ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 285.18 points, or 0.84%, to close at 34,407.60. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 1.23% to end at 4,450.38, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.45% to settle at 13,787.92. ***** &gt; Mega-cap technology stocks responsible for a sizeable chunk of 2023‚Ä≤s market gains rose Friday. Dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia jumped 3.6%, bringing its yearly gains to more than 189%. Netflix added about 2.9%, while Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Amazon rose 1.9%, 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively. Apple gained 2.3% to close above a $3 trillion market cap. ***** &gt; Elsewhere, Nike shares bucked the broad market uptrend. The apparel giant fell 2.7% after reporting a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit. ***** &gt; Friday marked a pivotal day for investors, bringing the conclusion of the month, second quarter and first half. The last six months saw 2022‚Ä≤s beaten-down growth names make a broad comeback as the promise of artificial intelligence and hope of an end to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate campaign lifted major tech players to astonishing heights. ***** &gt; Despite these strong gains, some on Wall Street expect volatility in the second half and likely profit taking from investors that benefited from the rally. This, coupled with changing technicals, could lead to sideways action, or a slight pullback in the S&amp;P, said Anna Han, equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe technicals are telling us that this ubercap-led rally has just been overextended,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been hitting those overbought levels, and we believe it‚Äôs time for that trade to kind of take a pause.‚Äù ***** &gt; This is where the major averages stand: ***** &gt; * For June: The S&amp;P 500 gained 6.5% for its best monthly performance since October. The Nasdaq advanced 6.6%. Both indexes notched a fourth consecutive positive month. The Dow climbed 4.6%, for its best month since November. &gt; * For the second quarter: The S&amp;P 500 rose 8.3%, on track for a third straight quarter of gains and its biggest quarterly advance since the fourth quarter of 2021. The Nasdaq jumped 12.8% for back-to-back positive quarters. The Dow added 3.4% for a third winning quarter. &gt; * For year to date and the first half: The S&amp;P 500 has popped 15.9% for its best first half since 2019. The Nasdaq surged 31.7%, for its best first half since 1983. The 30-stock Dow added a modest gain of 3.8%. The three major averages also notched winning weeks, gaining more than 2% each.  ***** &gt; Wall Street also got another hint of encouraging inflation news as the core personal consumption expenditures price index, a closely watched gauge by the Federal Reserve, rose less than expected in May. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThis is excellent news on the inflation fight,‚Äù said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt believe disinflation is happening, you aren‚Äôt paying attention. The Fed was right to pause and needs to hold firm at these levels to prevent overcorrecting and causing an unnecessary recession to fight a beast that is now under control.‚Äù  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # First Trading Day of July ‚Äì S&amp;P 500 Up 12 Straight  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Over the past 21 years from 2002-2022 July‚Äôs first trading has the second-best record up 85.7% of the time on the S&amp;P 500 with an average gain of 0.35%. Only August‚Äôs third to last trading day has a better record up 19 of 21 with an average gain of 0.57%.  &gt; DJIA‚Äôs first trading day of July has produced gains 76.2% of the time with an average gain of 0.31%. NASDAQ splits the middle up 81.0% (0.31% average gain) of the time. July‚Äôs first trading day is the third best performing first trading day of all twelve months based upon DJIA points gained with DJIA gaining a cumulative 1668.15 points since 1998.  &gt; Looking back even further to 1989, S&amp;P 500 has advanced 88.2% of the time (up 30 times in 34 years) with an average gain of 0.50%. DJIA has advanced 28 times in the same 34 years (82.4%) and NASDAQ has risen in 26 of those years (76.5%) with an average advance of 0.34% in all years. No other day of the year exhibits this amount of across-the-board strength, which makes a solid case for declaring the first trading day of July the most bullish day of the year over the past 34 years.  *****  &gt; # This is a Big Deal: Business Investment is Rising Again  &gt; We‚Äôve been getting a string of ‚Äúeconomic surprises‚Äù from the consumer side for several months now. Employment data is a prime example, with monthly payroll gains coming in above expectations for 14 straight months. For a change, we just got some good news from the business side, particularly business investment.  &gt; The Census Bureau collects data on manufacturers‚Äô shipments and new orders for durable goods ‚Äì big ticket items like transportation equipment (including vehicles and aircrafts), machinery, computers and electronic products, electrical equipment, and appliances, etc. New orders are particularly useful because it tells us how businesses are viewing current and future economic conditions and investing accordingly. It also tells us about future production commitments for manufacturers.  &gt; Well, new orders rose 1.7% in May, even as economists expected orders to decline almost 1%! New orders are now up 5.4% since last year, and this pace is higher than what we saw at any point in 2019.  &gt; A large part of this is because of nondefense aircraft orders, which surged 32% in May, and a whopping 61% over the past year. This is huge for America‚Äôs aircraft industry ‚Äì the recent uptrend stands in sharp contrast to what we saw in 2018-2019 when aircraft orders were declining amid Boeing‚Äôs 737-Max woes.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; However, as you can see above, aircraft orders are really volatile. It helps to strip them out, along with new orders from the defense industry (which can also be quite volatile).  &gt; What‚Äôs left is a key economic datapoint ‚Äì a category called nondefense capital goods ex aircraft, which is really a proxy for business investment, or capital expenditures (‚Äúcapex‚Äù). This rose 0.7% in May, yet another datapoint that beat forecasts (expectations were for a 0.1% increase). New orders for these ‚Äúcore capital goods‚Äù are now up 2.1% from last year and rising at a 3.2% annualized pace over the first 5 months of this year.  &gt; Now, this data is nominal, in that it‚Äôs not adjusted for prices. And we‚Äôve had a lot of inflation over the past year and a half. But even after you adjust for inflation, this proxy for business investment rose 0.3% in May, following a 0.5% increase in April. Investment in real terms has been falling since the beginning of 2022, and so the 0.8% uptick over the past two months is very welcome.  &gt; Here‚Äôs something a lot of people don‚Äôt talk about when they compare today‚Äôs economy to the pre-pandemic economy, which is widely recognized as strong: business investment collapsed in 2019, amid a lot of uncertainty around the trade war, and escalating tariffs. Hopefully, the recent uptick not only reverses the downtrend from last year, but also the pre-pandemic downtrend.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; We do recognize that two months do not make a trend. But other data also corroborate the fact that businesses are investing again.  &gt; **Something big is happening in America**  &gt; Nonresidential construction is booming, mostly thanks to manufacturing construction. I discussed what was happening a few months ago, but there has been no slowdown in the data since then. Even after adjusting for inflation, manufacturing construction is up 84% over the past year through April. Most of this is being driven by a 233% increase in construction in the computers, electronics, and electricals sector, i.e. semiconductor and electrical vehicle battery plants.  &gt; The chart below shows how manufacturing construction was stagnant across most of the past decade, but it seems to have broken out now. There was an inflection point last summer after Congress passed the CHIPS Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act (which had less to do with inflation and more to do with promoting investment via subsidies and tax credits). Also interesting, this is a phenomenon that is happening only in the US ‚Äì other developed countries like Germany, Japan, UK, and Australia are not seeing a similar surge.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Finally, if you look at just S&amp;P 500 companies, capital expenditure expectations over the next 12 months have been rising consistently this year. Forward-looking capex expectations are up almost 4% over the first six months of this year, and up 7% compared to a year ago.  &gt; This is not something that would be happening amid a slowdown, let alone a recession. The chart below shows how capex expectations were stagnant in 2019 amid higher uncertainty. That‚Äôs not the case today, even amid all the recession forecasts.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Business sentiment has been quite poor, perhaps because of all the headline-grabbing recession forecasts. However, the hard data suggests that businesses are investing and looking to expand capacity ‚Äì a sign that they view future economic conditions positively when it comes to putting money to work.  *****  &gt; # There's Something About June 29th  &gt; There must be something about June 29th. Besides being a significant day of the year from a seasonal perspective (as discussed in Wednesday's Chart of the Day), two crucial events related to some of the most significant business stories of the past two decades took place on this day, two years apart. The first involved Bernie Madoff, who infamously orchestrated the largest Ponzi scheme in history, although it is worth noting that Madoff once described the Federal Government as another Ponzi scheme, so by his logic, he would have only overseen the second largest Ponzi scheme ever. On this day in 2009, Madoff, once a highly respected and well-loved figure on Wall Street, stood alone in a Manhattan courtroom, devoid of any familial or friendly support, and received a sentence of 150 years in prison.  &gt; On a much brighter note, two years earlier in 2007, Apple fans lined up and, in some cases, camped outside of stores for days to be among the first to get their hands on the first-generation iPhone. The fact that people were willing to pay over $500 for a heretofore unproven smartphone should have been all we needed to see to know that this was going to usher in a revolution in the entire computing industry.  &gt; Given the success of the iPhone and the scandal of Madoff, you would think that the launch of the iPhone would have been a positive market event and the Madoff sentencing would be associated with a negative market environment. As the chart below illustrates, though, the exact opposite was the case. The first iPhones didn‚Äôt just go on sale within four months of any ordinary market peak; the formal launch preceded a 56%+ peak-to-trough drop in the S&amp;P 500 that was the largest drawdowns since the Great Depression. Conversely, Madoff‚Äôs sentencing came less than four months after that same largest drawdown since the Great Depression ended.  &gt; We‚Äôve said it before and we‚Äôll say it again, but investing based on the headlines can be one of the worst investment strategies known to man.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # July Historically Opens Strong, But Fades After Mid-Month  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; July is the third month of DJIA‚Äôs and S&amp;P 500‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorst Six Months‚Äù and the first month of NASDAQ‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorst Four Months.‚Äù Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital. But by around mid-month, inflows have faded and the market‚Äôs performance in July usually peaks. This tends to create a strong open and first half. In all the years examined the major indexes tend to reach a peak around mid-month and then drift sideways to slightly lower for the remainder of the month. In pre-election years since 1950, the mid-month peak and second half declines have more pronounced especially for NASDAQ and Russell 2000.  *****  &gt; # Tech Selloff Sets Up NASDAQ‚Äôs Midyear Rally  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The week after June Triple Witching delivered its expected weakness, but this sets up NASDAQ‚Äôs 12-day midyear rally to a T.  &gt; In the mid-1980s tech‚Äôs influence in the market began to grow and the market‚Äôs focus in early summer shifted to the outlook for second quarter earnings of technology companies. In anticipation of positive results, over the last three trading days of June and the first nine trading days in July, NASDAQ typically enjoys a rally. This 12-day run has been up 29 of the past 38 years with an average historical gain of 2.4%. Look for this rally to begin around June 28 and run until about July 14.  &gt; After the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000, NASDAQ‚Äôs mid-year rally had a spotty track record from 2002 until 2009 with three appearances and five no-shows in those years. However, it has been quite solid over the last thirteen years, up eleven times with two losses. Last year, NASDAQ faltered during the 12-day span, but eventually took off in the second half of July, up 12.3%.  &gt; Our strategy is to buy the close on Tuesday June 27 and sell July 14 or take profits on any sizable gain in between.  *****  &gt; # DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ historically cooler in pre-election year Julys  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter, however the mostly negative results in August and September tend to make the comparison easy. ‚ÄúHot‚Äù Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&amp;P 500 both gained greater than 6% combined with strong performances in 2013, 2018, and 2022 have boosted July‚Äôs average gains since 1950 to 1.3% and 1.3% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a ‚Äúsummer rally‚Äù, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac 2023).  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Pre-election-year July rankings are something of a mixed bag, ranking #7 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500, averaging gains of 1.0% and 0.9% respectively (since 1950); while NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979) pre-election Julys both rank #9. NASDAQ has advanced in seven of the last thirteen pre-election Julys. Russell 2000 has advanced in five of its last ten. Despite tech‚Äôs and small-cap‚Äôs meager pre-election July track record, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have averaged gains of 1.0% and 0.3% respectively.  *****  Here is the list of notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)  *****  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]( &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)  *****  Here is the full list of companies report earnings for this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 7.3.23 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) (NONE.)  &gt; # ***Monday 7.3.23 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) (NONE.)  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 7.4.23 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) (NONE.

Here‚Äôre some answers to some of the common questions.  &gt; # What is happening with regional banks? &gt; The crisis erupted with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in early March. SVB hit the end of the road with a classic run on the bank, i.e. depositors rushing out the door, even as the bank‚Äôs asset values had deteriorated due to long-term bond holdings that lost value as interest rates surged over the past year. The FDIC eventually took over the insolvent bank, along with Signature Bank and First Republic (in late April). So regional banks have been under pressure over the past 2 months, as investors extrapolated some of the problems that plagued the three troubled banks to others.  &gt; Then last week saw renewed selling pressure on regional bank stocks. On May 4th, PacWest Bancorp fell 51.6% and Western Alliance Bancorp fell 41%. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) fell 7.2% just on that day. Now, as you can see in the chart below, there‚Äôs been quite a recovery since then, but prices are still down significantly since the crisis started. The KRE ETF is down almost 34.6% since March 8th, when the crisis started.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; # Why are small bank stock prices still under pressure? It helps to understand how a bank works. They make money by borrowing money from depositors (yes, when you put money in a bank, you‚Äôre lending money to it) and lending money to consumers and businesses. The difference between the interest rate they charge borrowers and the rate they pay depositors is their ‚Äúnet interest margin‚Äù (NIM), or profit. Right now, the fear is that profitability has reduced as banks, especially smaller ones, have to increase the rates they pay depositors to keep them from fleeing. However, what‚Äôs important to know is that reduced profitability is different from insolvency, which is what happened to the 3 banks that went under.  &gt; # What‚Äôs different from SVB and some of these other regional banks? The main problem for SVB was that more than 90% of their deposits were uninsured. When news spread that their assets were impaired, and they were looking to raise capital, these depositors fled as they were worried that they wouldn‚Äôt get their money back. We wrote about it in depth at the time.  &gt; In contrast, banks like PacWest and Western Alliance have a much smaller percent of deposits that are uninsured (about 25%) ‚Äì making them potentially less prone to a run.  &gt; # So why did the stock prices for these banks crash on May 4th? As I wrote above, there doesn‚Äôt appear to be any fundamental solvency issues with these banks, other than perhaps reduced profitability. Instead, what happened last week was driven by stock market speculation. Case in point, short selling and put option activity on PacWest and Western Alliance surged recently. Put options allow investors to profit from lower stock prices. In this case, market makers and dealers who sold these positions were ‚Äúlong‚Äù stocks and had to hedge that by shorting. This pushed prices lower, and eventually led to dealers having to sell even more shares short, especially as investors bought even more puts.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; # Wait, is this something like the meme stock frenzy? &gt; In a sense, yes. If you remember, back in early 2021 stock prices for meme stocks surged on speculative activity, particularly call option buying. Dealers who sold these options were essentially ‚Äúshort‚Äù the stock. So, they had to hedge to be directionally neutral, which they did by buying stock, pushing prices higher. And as the social media frenzy picked up, prices surged as dealers had to buy even more stock.  &gt; I made the following schematic to illustrate what happened with regional banks last week. Now historically bank runs have been triggered by news events, and that can potentially happen a lot quicker these days because of social media. Speculators were betting that the bank in trouble will see deposits flee, and eventually be taken over by the FDIC, an event that would wipe out shareholders and result in profits for investors betting on these bank stock prices crashing. The good news is that the negative feedback loop was broken pretty quickly.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; # Could this be the canary in the coalmine, and can the crisis spread? &gt; Never say never in the investment business. But one big sign that trouble is not spreading is that banks are not accessing the Federal Reserve‚Äôs (Fed) liquidity facilities to the extent they were a few weeks ago. Loans to banks via the Fed‚Äôs facilities are at the lowest level in 7 weeks. There are three pieces here: &gt; * Lending to FDIC depository institutions (yellow bar in the chart below) ‚Äì These are loans extended to banks that were subsequently taken over by the FDIC, like SVB, Signature and First Republic. This increased in the latest data because First Republic was just taken over. &gt; * Discount window (dark blue bars) ‚Äì Banks can use this to access liquidity in exchange for collateral (like US treasuries). It‚Äôs fallen from $153 billion to $5 billion over the last month, which is close to where it was before the SVB crisis. &gt; * Bank term funding program (green bar) ‚Äì This is a new facility that the Fed set up in March after the SVB crisis. Banks can access liquidity here by exchanging securities at their full par value. This has dropped from a peak of $81 billion to $76 billion, which is a very positive sign.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Another positive sign: the latest data from the Fed shows that deposits at small commercial banks in the US have stabilized over the past month. Deposits at these banks cratered over the two weeks after the SVB crisis, and the worry was that this would continue.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; # Will there be a broader economic impact, due to a credit crunch? &gt; The latest Fed survey of loan officers from showed that banks tightened credit at the start of the second quarter. However, the net percent of survey respondents saying they tightened standards for commercial and industrial loans did not increase significantly, rising from 44.8% in January to 46% in April. But here‚Äôs the other side of that: 54% said that standards ‚Äúremained basically unchanged‚Äù.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Make no mistake, credit standards have tightened over the past year. But that was already the case before the SVB crisis, and it really hasn‚Äôt had much of an impact on the economy as we saw from the recent GDP growth data for Q1.  &gt; Note that banks are still making loans. In fact, bank lending is up 8.5% over the past year ‚Äì it was running at a pace of around 5% before the pandemic. Now a big part of that is due to inflation, as higher prices mean loans are larger. But bank lending doesn‚Äôt look to have completely collapsed.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Ultimately, what is important with respect to the current economic expansion (since 2020) is that this is NOT a credit driven cycle. This contrasts with the late 1980s, late 1990s and mid-2000s. During those periods, credit growth drove business and real estate investment, and consumer spending. Eventually, when losses on loans spread, credit was pulled back and the economy went into a recession.  &gt; Right now, economic growth is being driven by strong incomes, because of strong employment and wage growth. And so far, there‚Äôs no reason to believe that will not continue.  *****  &gt; # Stocks Love Day Before Mother‚Äôs Day Better  &gt; With just a few days until Mother‚Äôs Day, this is also a reminder. Always used to plant flowers with mom and pick the fresh blooming lilacs. Over the last 28 years on the Friday before Mother‚Äôs Day Dow has gained ground 19 times. On Monday after, DJIA has advanced 17 times. Average gain on Friday has been 0.26% and 0.23% on Monday. However, Monday following Mother‚Äôs Day has been down 8 of the last 11 years. In 2019, DJIA suffered its worst post Mother‚Äôs Day loss going back to 1995, off 2.38%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # 11 Things To Know About The Debt Ceiling  &gt; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt make jokes. I just watch the government and report the facts.‚Äù  &gt; ‚Äì Will Rogers  &gt; One of the top questions we‚Äôve received lately has to do with the impending debt ceiling drama and what it could all mean. Here are some common questions and answers regarding this excitement out of Washington.  &gt; * What is the debt ceiling? Simply put, it is how much money our country has to pay the bills, authorized by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and the Treasury. This is one of those weird ways in which government functions. Congress typically authorizes spending bills, which the President signs into law. Historically, this spending has exceeded government revenues, and Treasury issues debt to cover the deficit. However, there is a ‚Äúceiling‚Äù to how much total debt Treasury can incur. Congress typically has to pass a second bill authorizing the ceiling to move higher, so that Treasury can pay for spending that was already passed into law. Not raising the debt ceiling is akin to going to a restaurant, ordering and eating the food, and then walking out without paying the bill.  &gt; * What is paid from this? Medicare and Social Security are two of the big ones. But tax refunds, military salaries and interest on national debt are also part of the current $31.4 trillion debt ceiling.  &gt; * How common is a debt ceiling increase? Very common is the short answer. The first time it was used was in 1917 to help finance World War I and has happened more than 100 times since. In fact, every President back to Eisenhower has increased the debt ceiling, for a total of 89 times since 1959. President Biden has increased it twice already, which is the least number of times any President has increased it going back 11 Presidents.  &gt; * What happens if the current debt ceiling isn‚Äôt increased? In theory the U.S. would default on their debt, meaning they‚Äôve run out of money and can‚Äôt pay the bills. We do not expect this to happen, and it has only happened once in history, in 1979, but that was more of a clerical error and was fixed rather quickly. Janet Yellen recently said it needs to be increased or such a failure would lead to a ‚Äústeep economic downturn‚Äù in the U.S.  &gt; * Who else does it this way? The only two countries who have a debt ceiling and require the Government to vote on it and set the limits are the U.S. and Denmark. That‚Äôs it. Nearly all other countries set things as a percentage of their GDP. Why does this U.S. choose to do it this way? This one may be out of my paygrade, but I think it could have something to do with why we like our political theater here in the U.S.  &gt; * When will the U.S. run out of money? This is known as the ‚ÄòX date‚Äô, when the U.S. will run out of money. No one knows this exact day, but Janet Yellen recently said it could be as early as June 1, well before when some of the well-known investment banks were forecasting. Sometime in June seems to be the most widely expected timeframe.  &gt; * What options does Congress have? They could do nothing and potentially let the U.S. default, while they could also raise the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling. Another option is Congress can suspend the debt ceiling, something they did seven times since 2013, including as recently as August 2019 to July 2021. President Biden has invited the major members of Congress (Chuck Schumer, Mitch McConnell, Kevin McCarthy, and Hakeem Jefferies) to the White House today (May 9) to discuss and find a resolution.  &gt; * What about the makeup of Congress? Speaking of Congress, the debt ceiling has historically been increased whether we‚Äôve had a Democratic, Republican or split Congress. Majority of the time, debt ceilings have been raised when Democrats have full control, though that‚Äôs because they were in the power majority of the time since 1959. Specifically, when we have a split Congress (like right now, with a Democratic Senate and Republican House), the debt ceiling has been increased 24 times. So, history says that a split Congress shouldn‚Äôt be an impediment to raising the ceiling yet again.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; * How likely is a deal? Sonu put together this great SWOT analysis of President Biden and Speaker McCarthy, with some help from Punchbowl News. The Carson Investment Research team‚Äôs base case remains that there‚Äôs a big disconnect between the two sides right now, but the opportunity is there for some dealing with a final deal before the clock strikes midnight after the final posturing. Ultimately, it‚Äôs in neither President Biden‚Äôs or Speaker McCarthy‚Äôs interest to see a default, and potential economic catastrophe, under their watch.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; * What happens if they let the U.S. default? We‚Äôd like to stress this is not the base case and we fully expect cooler heads to prevail, but should the U.S. default on its debt (meaning they miss a bond payment to holders of Treasuries) the chances greatly increase of much higher interest rates, a likely recession, and extreme market volatility. Many investors remember back in the summer of 2011 when both sides had trouble agreeing on a new debt ceiling and S&amp;P downgraded the debt on the U.S., causing nearly a 19% decline in the S&amp;P 500 over the following week.  &gt; * What do most of the experts think? Most political experts we follow expect the debt ceiling to be increased before X date, making it 90 increases since 1959. This is Washington after all and everyone has an agenda, but we don‚Äôt expect the current members of Congress want to be blamed should the U.S. default on its debt, causing a major drop in the stock market and potential recession right ahead of an election year.  &gt; So there you have it, 11 things to know about the current debt ceiling drama. We are a long way from a resolution and this will likely be all over the news the coming weeks, but in the end, we think the football will be punted once again.  *****  &gt; # Megacaps Still Carrying Their Weight  &gt; Heading into earnings season, there was a considerable amount of angst on the part of investors regarding the mecacap stocks and how they would react to their earnings reports. Given their outperformance in Q1, the prevailing view was that the bar was too high, leaving the megacaps susceptible to disappointment when they reported. Within the S&amp;P 500, there are seven companies whose weighting exceeds 1.5% in the index, and in the chart below we list the performance of each company's stock (largest to smallest) on the earnings reaction day of their most recent report. Of the seven companies highlighted, only two (Alphabet and Amazon.com) declined in reaction to their reports. Two stocks (Nvidia and Meta) surged more than 10%, one (Microsoft) rallied more than 7%, and Apple, with its weighting of over 7%, managed to rise more than 4.5% following its report last week. There's still a ton of reports left to get through before earnings season winds down, but on a market cap basis, we're past the peak, and based on the reactions of the largest companies in the market, it's been a much better earnings season than most investors expected.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; (*T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.*)  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  &gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).  &gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  # DISCUSS!

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 8th, 2023,;,; Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 8th, 2023.  # **Dow jumps 500 points to break four-day losing streak as regional banks and Apple shares surge: Live updates - [(Source)]( ***** &gt; Stocks popped on Friday as regional bank shares climbed off their lows and market-darling Apple jumped after posting better-than-expected quarterly earnings. ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 546.64 points, or 1.65%, to close at 33,674.38. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 1.85%, ending the day at 4,136.25. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 2.25% and closed at 12,235.41. ***** &gt; Despite Friday‚Äôs rally, the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 logged their worst week since March. The 30-stock Dow lost 1.24%, while the S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.8%. The Nasdaq eked out a small weekly gain of 0.07%. ***** &gt; Stocks rose even as April‚Äôs jobs numbers came in hotter than expected. The U.S. economy added 253,000 jobs in April. Wall Street had expected 180,000 new jobs, according to Dow Jones. ***** &gt; Late Thursday, Apple posted beats on the top and bottom lines for the fiscal second quarter, propelled by iPhone sales. Apple shares gained about 4.7%. ***** &gt; The rebound for regional bank stocks was boosted by a note from JPMorgan, which upgraded Western Alliance, Zions Bancorp and Comerica to overweight. The firm said those three banks appear ‚Äúsubstantially mispriced‚Äù in part due to short-selling activity. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) advanced more than 6%. PacWest ‚Äî which is down sharply this week on news it‚Äôs considering strategic options that include a sale ‚Äî popped 81.7%. Western Alliance also jumped 49.2%. ***** &gt; Shares of regional banking companies have been under pressure this week, as traders fear other institutions could suffer the same fate as Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Both banks collapsed in March. ***** &gt; Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi, doesn‚Äôt believe the fallout in the regional banking sector is over despite Friday‚Äôs rebound. ‚ÄúWhen the whole news cycle started, it was sort-of explained away ‚Ä¶ as a unique circumstance for certain institutions. The reality is that liquidity is a universal challenge,‚Äù she said. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe issue originally was that deposit flight was occurring. ‚Ä¶ But now that the pressure is no longer necessarily deposit flight. It‚Äôs this mark to market of the securities on all their books,‚Äù Young continued. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúSo I don‚Äôt think that this news cycle isn‚Äôt necessarily over. ‚Ä¶ I also don‚Äôt think it dies of natural causes in the sense [that] it heats up and then just kind of cools down with no effect,‚Äù she added.  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](   *****  &gt; # Don‚Äôt Fear the Seasons ‚Äì Sell in May  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; But don‚Äôt go away. We actually sold some positions in April when we issued our MACD Best 6 Months Seasonal Sell Signal to Almanac Investor subscribers. Reposition in May is a better strategy. Best &amp; Worst Months stats plus a compounding onetime $10K investment tell the story. Can‚Äôt argue with success.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Worst Six Months May-October is not a binary selloff. Risk is elevated historically, stocks tend to be volatile, moving sideways with choppy trading ‚Äì illustrated in the chart. Anyone who tries to refute this by going back past WWII is making a moot point as the seasonal pattern was inverted when our economy was agrarian driven in yesteryear.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; We sold $DIA &amp; $SPY, plus other seasonal sector trades, underperforming stocks and rotated into some bond ETFs. This is the time of year we shift to a neutral stance ‚Äì between our Dow/S&amp;P Best Six Months MACD Sell Signal and our NASDAQ Best 8 Months MACD Seasonal Sell on or after June 1.  &gt; Everyone gets hyper focused on whether you should Sell in May or not. But forget as I like to say: ‚ÄúBuy in October and get yourself sober.‚Äù From my October 4 Buy Signal to my April 25 Sell DIA and SPY trades were up 10.8% and 8.2% respectively. QQQ is up 15.5% from the October 4 Buy as of midafternoon trading today.  &gt; If there is any year it‚Äôs time to get defensive in May, it‚Äôs this year. With the debt ceiling showdown, the banking crisis, inflation, interest rates and the slowing economy, it is a perfect time to move to the sidelines and enjoy the healthy yields in bonds.  *****  &gt; # Seasonal Mid Point  &gt; Today marks the midpoint of spring, so from here on, we can say that we're closer to summer than winter. Summer isn't typically thought of as a positive time for equities, but as highlighted in the "Seasonality" section of our Morning Lineup today, the next three months, which is the period straddling the back half of spring and the first half of summer, has been relatively strong in the last ten years. The table and charts below summarize the performance of the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) and each sector-tracking ETF from the close on May 5th through August 5th. The S&amp;P 500's median performance during this period over the last ten years has been a gain of 5% with positive returns 90% of the time. Leading the way higher, Health Care (XLV), Real Estate (XLRE), and Technology (XLK) have all experienced median gains of over 5% with positive returns 85% of the time or more. In addition to XLV and XLK, Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Consumer Staples (XLP) have also been up during this period in nine of the last ten years. On the downside, the only sector that has had a negative return on a median basis has been Energy (XLE). Ironically, even last year when the sector outperformed the broader market by a significant degree, it not only declined (-8.3%), but it also underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by a wide margin during this three-month stretch.  &gt; Looking at the last ten years, in every year since 2013, there have only been two years that the majority of sectors in the S&amp;P 500 declined during this period (XLRE price data doesn't begin until 2016 while XLC didn't start trading until June 2018). Last year, six of eleven sectors traded lower even as the S&amp;P 500 had a marginal gain, while in 2019, eight of eleven sectors declined as the S&amp;P 500 fell 3%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # May the Fed be With You  &gt; Happy Star Wars Day, or if you‚Äôre fan like I am (or have a birthday today like I do), May the 4th be with you!  &gt; Of course, the title is a play on all this, but I find it apt since the Federal Reserve (Fed) looms so large as far as investors are concerned.  &gt; The good news is that their aggressive rate hike campaign to fight inflation appears close to the end. It saw them raising rates by 5%, including the latest 0.25%-point increase they just implemented. The federal funds rate is now in the 5-5.25% range, which is the highest it got to during the mid-2000s economic expansion.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The rate hike in May was expected, but what was more welcome was the fact that the Fed didn‚Äôt think that ‚Äúadditional policy firming may be appropriate‚Äù. While this is not an explicit signal that they are pausing, it did signal that they will be more data dependent. Fed Chair Powell explicitly referenced this when he talked about the future direction of policy, saying it will be assessed based on incoming data, including employment and inflation. Plus, they‚Äôve done a lot ‚Äì and they believe the economy is yet to reflect the full impact of that.  &gt; However, as we wrote in our 2023 outlook, the big question for policy this year wasn‚Äôt how high they‚Äôll go. Instead, the question was how long they‚Äôll stick with high interest rates, which they view as ‚Äúsufficiently restrictive‚Äù to bring inflation down to their target of 2%.  &gt; Here we have a disconnect.  &gt; # Markets vs the Fed &gt; In his post-meeting press conference, Powell was fairly clear that they remain focused on getting inflation back down to target. Inflation has moderated but remains elevated. Their forecasts don‚Äôt suggest inflation will pull back in rapid fashion, which means rate cuts would NOT be appropriate.  &gt; On the other hand, markets are well ahead of the Fed. Investors estimate that there are no more rate hikes coming, and even beyond that, they expect the Fed to cut rates a few times before the end of the year. The chart below shows the difference between expected federal funds rate in December 2023 and June 2023. The difference right now is more than 80 basis points (0.80%), indicating at least 3 rate cuts of 0.25%-points each in the second half of 2023.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; We wrote about this disconnect after the Fed‚Äôs prior meeting in March, but it is surprising that it hasn‚Äôt resolved yet. In fact, rate cut expectations increased after Powell‚Äôs press conference.  &gt; You can also see how rate cut expectations surged after the SVB crisis hit, but we‚Äôve also seen a lot of volatility in these expectations since then ‚Äì as you can tell from how expectations moved after the SVB crisis hit.  &gt; # Recession expectations &gt; It appears that investors are expecting a recession in the second half of the year, which will force the Fed‚Äôs hand. However, it can be useful to look to history to put current expectations in context.  &gt; I looked at the last 3 rate cut cycles that came about amid recessions, and on average the Fed has cut rates by about 525 bps over 1.5-2 years. The table below shows the list. The 2020 recession was excluded because it was so short, both the recession and the rate cut cycle.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; One thing you can see above is that the timing of the first rate cut is 0-3 months ahead of the start of a recession.  &gt; Markets are currently pricing the first rate cut in September 2023. Based on history, that would point to expectations for a recession starting between September and December 2023.  &gt; Meanwhile, investors expect the federal funds rate to be about 2.9% by the end of 2024, i.e. 19 months from now. That is about 220 basis points lower than the highest rate expected this cycle, of 5.1% (where the fed funds rate is currently).  &gt; Using a very simple calculation, and the fact that historically the Fed has cut by an average of 525 basis points, this would imply that the probability of a recession is just over 40% (220 divided by 525). In short, that is akin to rolling a 6-sided die and the odds of seeing a 5 or a 6 come up.  &gt; That is high. However, 42% is less than 50% and that means the base case is not a recession. Obviously, this is subject to a lot of noise, and crucially, these odds can change. Just two weeks ago, the expectation was for about 170 bps of cuts by the end of 2024. That translates to a recession probability of 32%.  &gt; The increased odds of a recession after the Fed‚Äôs latest meeting and Powell‚Äôs post-meeting comments suggests that markets think the Fed is biased toward overly restrictive policy in their quest to tame inflation. Which in turn will lead to a crisis and/or recession, forcing them to reverse course and make cuts.  &gt; Fighting the Fed appears to be what investors are doing right now, even as the Fed tries to hold firm. So, expect bit of a bumpy ride as their views converge. And circling back to the title, may the Fed be with us all!  *****  &gt; # Initial and Continuing Claims in Opposite Directions  &gt; The latest reading on initial jobless claims disappointed coming in at 242K versus expectations of 240K. That is up from last week's downward revision to 229K. As shown in the inlaid chart below, claims have moved up to some of the highest levels in a over a year with the past several weeks marking relatively range bound readings. This week's increase to 240K marks a move to the high end of that recent range.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Before seasonal adjustment, claims came in at 219K. That is roughly in line with the readings of the comparable week off the year for the past few years excluding 2020 and 2021 when claims were more elevated due to the pandemic. Claims are also generally following seasonal trends with the current week having consistently seen declines week over week historically. With that said, claims have yet to make a new low on the year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Whereas initial claims were a slight disappointment, continuing claims surprised with an improvement this week. Rather than the increase to 1.865 million that was expected, they dropped all the way down to 1.805 million, the lowest reading in three weeks. Albeit improved in the near term, the uptrend in continuing claims remains in place as claims are around the highest levels since early 2022.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Sentiment Slouches  &gt; The S&amp;P 500 has firmly turned lower in the past few days and is nearing the lows from last Wednesday. In spite of that turn lower, bullish sentiment was unchanged at 24.1% per the latest AAII sentiment survey. Although less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish, that reading is only in the middle of the past year's range of readings as bullish sentiment has consistently been hard to come by.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; With no change to bullish sentiment, all of the moves occurred for neutral and bearish sentiment. Neutral sentiment has declined for three weeks in a row, coming in at a six week low of 31% this week.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; All of those declines to neutral sentiment were picked up by bears as that reading rose 6.4 percentage points to 44.9%. That is the highest reading since the end of March and right in line with the average reading of bearish sentiment since the beginning of 2022.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; With bearish sentiment moving higher, the bull-bear spread moved more firmly into negative territory. This week, bears outnumbered bulls by 20.8 percentage points; the widest spread in five weeks. That indicates the predominant share of respondents continue to expect the S&amp;P 500 to head lower over the next six months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; That negative outlook by individual investors is nothing new. Following the record streak of 44 straight weeks of a negative bull-bear spread that ended in February, the spread has resumed another lengthy streak of negative readings. This week marked the eleventh straight negative reading in the bull-bear spread. Even in the more recent context of the aforementioned record streak and another double-digit streak in the first quarter of last year, the AAII survey has seldom seen bears outnumber bulls on such a consistent basis.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Factoring in other sentiment surveys like those from Investors Intelligence and NAAIM reaffirms the bearish tones of sentiment. With all three surveys combined, our sentiment composite remains firmly negative meaning sentiment is more bearish than average. We would also note that due to the timing of the collection of these surveys, they would have mostly missed any reaction to the FOMC's rate decision and market response yesterday. As such, next week's surveys will be the first to fully reflect the latest 25 bps hike and subsequent market declines.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # The Last Hike?  &gt; By the time most of you read this, there‚Äôs a good chance the Fed hiked rates by 25 basis points to 5.25%, the 10th consecutive hike from a low of 0.5% during the depths of COVID. We have no clue if this is their last hike, but odds are we are getting quite close.  &gt; Let‚Äôs make this blog quick and easy. What if this is the last hike? Well, I went back and found the past 10 ‚Äòlast hikes‚Äô. Take note, it wasn‚Äôt until 1994 when the Fed actually announced their rate hikes for the whole world to know, so data before then isn‚Äôt always uniform. But for this, I‚Äôm using Bloomberg data.  &gt; Looking at those 10 cycles of higher rates showed that stocks were up one year later eight times and up more than 14% on average a year later after the last hike. Yes, May 2000 is in there and we all know how poorly stocks did after that hike, but for the most part, we find it hard to justify turning wildly bearish if this is indeed the final Fed hike. There are no doubt other reasons for worry, but this might not be one of them.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Here‚Äôs the same data, but shown a different way.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Midterm Best Six Months 19-0  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The Best Six Months November-April that begin in the Midterm is now 19-0, undefeated since 1950! These kinds of records are made to be broken, but not when it is based on such a sound and strong market seasonality.  &gt; Now that the S&amp;P logged a 7.7% return for the Best Six Months that just ended in April, it is time to reposition to a more neutral stance over the Worst Six Months May-October when market risk is elevated.  &gt; We don‚Äôt just Sell in May and go away, we reposition in May. Sell some things, cut losers, tighten up stops, limit new longs and move into bonds and sectors that do well in the Worst Six Months.  *****  &gt; # Recent 21-Year May Seasonal Pattern: Rough Start to Historically Choppy Month  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Historically, the first two or three trading days of May have logged gains. That has not been the case this time around. Recent market volatility suggests a day of gains could prove challenging, especially as the market awaits the Fed‚Äôs next move tomorrow. Additional bouts of weakness often appear in May around or on the third, sixth, and twelfth trading days of the month while the last four or five trading days have generally enjoyed respectable gains on average. In pre-election years it has generally been better to lighten up on long positions early in May as the entire month tends to be weak with DJIA and S&amp;P 500 finishing with average losses (pages 42 and 44 of Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac 2023).NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have performed best in pre-election year Mays.  *****  &gt; # Why This Stock Market is Like The Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls  &gt; ‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I‚Äôve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times, I‚Äôve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I‚Äôve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.‚Äù -Michael Jordan  &gt; One of the big knocks we keep hearing about this bull market is that it is being led by only a few names. I was on Fox Business with Charles Payne yesterday and the guest before me was spouting off the same stats we‚Äôve been hearing for months now. It has been widely reported that the largest two stocks in the S&amp;P 500 (Microsoft and Apple) represent close to 40% of the rally this year and the FAANG names (Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, Apple, Nvidia, and Alphabet (formerly Google) account for about 80% of the year-to-date gains.  &gt; Here‚Äôs what they don‚Äôt tell you, this is perfectly normal. You will always have the best stocks account for most of the gains. I compare this to the Chicago Bulls when they won six championships. Just because they had the best player of all-time, do those trophies not count the same? You want your best players to score most of the points. Steph Curry just dropped 50 in game 7 of a series and I‚Äôm pretty sure they advanced to the next round, even though he scored most of his team‚Äôs points.  &gt; Again, your leaders are your leaders and they will count for much of the gains, but the truth is many stocks are going higher. What‚Äôs the easiest way to show that it isn‚Äôt just a few stocks that are going higher? I like to use advance-decline (A/D) lines for this purpose. An A/D line is simply a cumulative total of how many stocks went up or down each day. Throughout history, we‚Äôve seen A/D lines break out to new highs before the indexes, while they also breakdown well ahead of actual price. This is one of the best ways to see what is really happening under the surface.  &gt; Well, the Dow A/D line recently broke out to new highs after consolidating for more than a year. With the Dow itself about 6% away from new highs, this is a clue that the nearly 125-year-old index will probably be following the A/D line to new highs sooner than later.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Turning to the S&amp;P 500 A/D line we see another potentially bullish scenario. This one hasn‚Äôt quite broken out to new highs, but it is extremely close. Take note how this has trended sideways for the duration of the recent bear market, implying the tailwind for a bull market wasn‚Äôt happening. Well, should this breakout (like we expect), it very well could suggest continued strength the rest of 2023 and potentially further.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  &gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).  &gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  # DISCUSS!

[Meta planning to release a text-based app that will compete with Twitter, as soon as June,;,; (Reuters) - Meta Platforms' Instagram is planning to release a text-based app that will compete with Twitter and may debut as soon as June, Bloomberg News reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.  The Facebook parent is testing the product with influencers and some creators, according to the report.  The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.  Meta has been contacting talent agencies and celebrities to gauge their interest in trying an early version of the app, which will be integrated with Instagram, said Alex Heath, reporter at the Verge, in a newsletter.  "The decentralized app is built on the back of Instagram but will be compatible with some other apps like Mastodon," according to a newsletter by Lia Haberman, who teaches social and influencer marketing at UCLA in California.

[Meta Is Said to Plan Thousands More Layoffs as Soon as This Week,;,; Meta Is Said to Plan Thousands More Layoffs as Soon as This Week  -Second round of cuts in four months driven by efficiency push  -Social networking giant may finalize plans in the next week  Meta Platforms Inc., the owner of Facebook and Instagram, is planning a fresh round of layoffs and will cut thousands of employees as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter.  The world‚Äôs largest social networking company is eliminating more jobs, on top of a 13% reduction in November, in a bid to become a more efficient organization. In its earlier round of cuts, Meta slashed 11,000 workers in what was its first-ever major layoff. The company has also been working to flatten its organization, giving buyout packages to managers and cutting whole teams it deems nonessential, Bloomberg News reported in February, a move that is still being finalized and could affect thousands of staffers.  The imminent round of cuts is being driven by financial targets and is separate from the ‚Äúflattening,‚Äù said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. Meta, which has seen a slowdown in advertising revenue and has shifted focus to a virtual-reality platform called the metaverse, has been asking directors and vice presidents to make lists of employees that can be let go, the people said. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment on the plans on Monday.  This phase of layoffs could be finalized in the next week, according to the people. **Those working on the plan are hoping to have it ready before Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg goes on parental leave for his third child, which may be imminent, one person said.**  The November cuts were a surprise, but another round of firings has been widely anticipated by the Meta workforce. Zuckerberg has dubbed 2023 Meta‚Äôs ‚Äúyear of efficiency,‚Äù and the company has been communicating that theme to employees during performance reviews, which were completed last week, the people said.  Workers at the Menlo Park, California-based company described heightened anxiety and low morale among colleagues lately. Some employees expressed worry about whether they‚Äôd receive their bonuses, which are set to be distributed this month, if they lose their jobs beforehand, the people said.   2023-03-07 02:42:03]

[Is $META going to benefit from Threads?,;,; One of the questions that many META shareholders have is, what is the impact of Threads on the company‚Äôs value?  The answer isn‚Äôt simple, and I‚Äôll try to break down the components and share my thoughts.  Mark Zuckerberg shared that monetization options would be explored once Threads hits one billion users (As am I writing this, there are over 83 million users. For comparison, Twitter has close to 400 million).        From Meta‚Äôs point of view, the so-called family of Apps includes two social media platforms - Facebook and Instagram. Both of these platforms are in mature monetization stages, where both the revenue per user and the margins are incredibly high.        If we take a look at the big picture, all social media companies make money by selling advertisements. The formula behind that is simple:  **Number of users** X **Time spent on the platform** X **Advertisement revenue**  The time that is being spent is limited, every one of us has 24 hours in a day and decides how to use (or waste) it.        Part of the Facebook/Instagram users will use part of their time using Threads and the impact is obvious. If we take a look at the formula above, it is quite clear that the time spent on Facebook/Instagram will be lower, hence, the revenue generated there is expected to decrease. In addition, as Threads is not monetized, it will only bring additional expenses for keeping the platform up and running. In the short run, there shouldn‚Äôt be high expectations for Meta when it comes to the financials.  Whether Threads will generate value, in the long run, depends on a few factors:  \- The # of users that join Threads, from Twitter.  \- The monetization per user of Threads, and how far it will be compared to Facebook/Instagram (So far, Twitter didn‚Äôt use its potential)  \- The outcome of the cease-and-desist letter sent to Meta by Spiro (Elon‚Äôs lawyer) for creating a ‚Äúcopycat‚Äù app.  &amp;#x200B;  Meta's value will increase, only if:        \- The total number of users (Facebook/Instagram/Threads) increases at the expense of Twitter, and;  \- The revenue generated is higher and can cover the additional expenses for running Threads.        I personally, do not think the new platform is creating a lot of value for Meta.,;,; 2023-07-08 17:26:32]
[Facebook-parent Meta planning more layoffs, to impact thousands: Report,;,; Facebook-parent Meta Platforms is planning a fresh round of job cuts in a reorganization and downsizing effort that could affect thousands of workers, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday.  Meta plans to push some leaders into lower-level roles without direct reports, flattening the layers of management between top boss Mark Zuckerberg and the company's interns, the Washington Post reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.  In November last year, Meta said it had laid off 11,000 employees, a little over a tenth of its global workforce, days after Twitter let go of nearly half its workforce.  The company is also considering more traditional cuts, including slashing some projects and jobs. These efforts, targeted at divisions across the company and worldwide, may not happen on a single day, but will likely roll out in the coming months.  Zuckerberg proclaimed 2023 the ‚Äúyear of efficiency,‚Äù promising investors he would trim middle management and speed up the company‚Äôs decision-making, hinting at the possibility of more cuts.

[Stocks for shorting in 2024 -Would you?,;,; The last quarter of 2023 (October-December) saw a strong rally in the US stock market, particularly in November and December. While various stocks saw impressive gains, the top performers varied depending on the specific timeframe and metric used (e.g., absolute gain, percentage gain, market cap). Here are some options to consider:        Overall Top Performers:        AppLovin (APP): +255.9% year-to-date (based on 2023 performance), driven by strong AI-powered advertising performance and positive financials.    Symbotic Inc. (SYM): +154.5% in the last quarter, boosted by rapid revenue growth in supply chain automation and AI adoption by major retailers.    Nvidia (NVDA): +122.5% in the last quarter, fueled by booming data center business and optimism about AI applications.    Meta Platforms (META): +85.4% in the last quarter, rebounding from a 2022 downturn thanks to recovering online advertising demand.    Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL): +68.7% in the last quarter, as travel and leisure stocks benefited from easing pandemic concerns.    Other notable gainers:        Palo Alto Networks (PANW): +48.5% in the last quarter, driven by cybersecurity demand amid increasing cyber threats.    Tesla (TSLA): +44.2% in the last quarter, propelled by positive electric vehicle deliveries and production ramp-up.    PulteGroup (PHM): +43.2% in the last quarter, buoyed by strong housing market trends and favorable mortgage rates.    Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): +42.1% in the last quarter, benefiting from chip shortages and robust demand for its processors.    Carnival Corporation (CCL): +41.3% in the last quarter, mirroring RCL's recovery in the cruise line industry.,;,; 2023-12-30 15:08:48]
[Meta Up 9% Premarket After Strong Earnings Reported with ‚ÄúMonster‚Äù Guidance,;,; [  Meta Platforms impressively exceeded expectations in Q2 2023, reporting strong earnings and revenue driven by the success of its AI-powered ad campaign. The company's stock surged 9% in premarket trading, reaching $325.53 ahead of Thursday's market opening. A robust rebound in the digital ad market and advertisers' growing confidence in Meta's AI capabilities contributed to its remarkable quarterly performance.  Looking ahead, Meta issued an optimistic revenue forecast for Q3 2023, anticipating revenues between $32 billion and $34.5 billion. Bernstein analysts described this guidance as a "monster guidance," implying a potential year-over-year growth of at least 15%. Additionally, Meta's short-form video offering, Reels, achieved an impressive annual revenue run rate of over $10 billion in the latest quarter, demonstrating the platform's continued expansion and monetization.  Despite facing losses in its virtual world business division, Meta remains committed to its metaverse vision. CEO Mark Zuckerberg reiterated the company's dedication to investing in AI and advancing the metaverse concept, considering the two areas as overlapping and complementary. With the recent launch of Threads, a direct competitor to Twitter, which attracted over 10 million users within hours, Meta continues to showcase its adaptability and drive for innovation in the tech industry.,;,; 2023-07-27 11:58:11]
[Meta sued by 33 state AGs for addictive features targeting kids,;,;   * A bipartisan group of attorneys general is suing Meta over its addictive features aimed at kids and teens. * The lawsuit represents the broad bipartisan interest in protecting kids and teens from online harm. * Meta designed its Facebook and Instagram products to keep young users on them for longer and repeatedly coming back, the AGs allege.  A bipartisan group of 33 attorneys general is suing Meta  over addictive features aimed at kids and teens, according to a complaint filed Tuesday in a federal court in California. The support from so many state AGs of different political backgrounds indicates a significant legal challenge to Meta‚Äôs business.  The lawsuit represents the latest legal challenge for the company and is another demonstration of the bipartisan priority that state law enforcers have placed on protecting kids and teens from online harm.  It‚Äôs also not the first time a broad coalition of state AGs have teamed up to go after Meta. In 2020, 48 states and territories sued the company on antitrust grounds, alongside a separate complaint from the Federal Trade Commission.  Meta designed its Facebook and Instagram products to keep young users on them for longer and repeatedly coming back, the AGs allege. According to the federal complaint, Meta did this via the design of its algorithms, copious alerts, notifications and so-called infinite scroll through platform feeds. The company also includes features that the AGs allege negatively impact teens‚Äô mental health through social comparison or promoting body dysmorphia, such as ‚Äúlikes‚Äù or photo filters.  The federal suit also accuses Meta of violating the Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting personal data on users under 13 without parental consent.  The states are seeking an end to what they see as Meta‚Äôs harmful practices, as well as penalties and restitution.  Meta was well aware of the negative effects its design could have on its young users, the AGs allege.  Former Facebook employee Frances Haugen caused an uproar among lawmakers and parents in 2021 after leaking internal documents from the company that revealed internal research on its products. One set of documents about Instagram‚Äôs impact on teens found that ‚Äúthirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse,‚Äù The Wall Street Journal reported before Haugen made her identity known. Following the report, Instagram said it was working on ways to pull users away from dwelling on negative topics.  Several of the practices the AGs focus on for Meta are similar to those exercised by other social media businesses, such as designing algorithms to keep users engaged.  Among the states that filed the suit are California, Colorado, Louisiana, Nebraska, New York, South Carolina, Washington and Wisconsin.,;,; 2023-10-24 15:47:38]
[Are stocks telling us a pullback is ahead?,;,; During Thanksgiving week, typically marked by reduced stock trading volume, key stocks like **Microsoft (MSFT)**, **Amazon**, **Adobe Systems**, and **Meta Platforms** hit 52-week highs.    **The S&amp;P 500** had risen 11% from its October low, with its relative strength index (RSI) reaching 71.3, suggesting potential overbought conditions. The Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq-100 also had elevated RSIs, indicating traders' uncertainty amid the battle for control of artificial intelligence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw an RSI of 71.2, influenced by Microsoft's new high.    While RSIs above 70 generally warn of a potential pullback, the current levels do not indicate extreme conditions.

[Mark Zuckerberg is worth $100 billion for first time since February 2022,;,; Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs fortune hit the $100 billion threshold Thursday for the first time since February 2022, making him the world‚Äôs 11th richest person, per Forbes‚Äô calculations. Shares of Meta Platforms, where Zuckerberg is CEO and co-founder, rose 3% for the day, lifting his fortune by $3 billion. Meta Platforms is the parent company of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as virtual reality arm Oculus.  Meta‚Äôs share price has been rising steadily since hitting a trough in November 2022, notching a nearly 220% gain. In November last year, Zuckerberg was worth $32.8 billion and ranked the world‚Äôs 29th richest. He fell out of the world‚Äôs top 10 richest in January 2022.        Meta‚Äôs stock is up largely due to analyst and investor optimism around the company‚Äôs cost cutting, which included 21,000 layoffs since November 2022. Zuckerberg has branded 2023 the ‚Äúyear of efficiency‚Äù for Meta.        Meta stock rebounded this week from a 2.8% drop last week, which market watchers tied to Apple‚Äôs launch of its new virtual reality headset, a competitor to Meta‚Äôs Quest. Meta has spent billions to gain market share in the virtual reality space.        The rise in Meta‚Äôs stock came amid a good day for stock indices: the S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average each closed up more than 1%, in part as a reaction to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs decision Wednesday to pause interest rate hikes. Meta‚Äôs stock is up 126% this year, far outpacing the tech-heavy Nasdaq‚Äôs 33% rise.        As of Thursday‚Äôs market close, Zuckerberg‚Äôs net worth is just $800 million shy of Google cofounder Sergey Brin, who is currently the world‚Äôs 10th richest.

[Nvidia hits $1 trillion market cap,;,;   Nvidia briefly hit a $1 trillion market cap at the open Tuesday, joining a small club of mostly technology companies. Nvidia‚Äôs shares have to hold above $404.86 to maintain that distinction throughout the day. The chipmaker‚Äôs stock rocketed last week after it posted quarterly earnings with top- and bottom-line numbers that significantly beat consensus estimates. Nvidia‚Äôs gain buoyed other chipmakers, with the notable exception of Intel, and was also fueled in part by estimates that were more optimistic than expected.  Significantly, Nvidia forecast $11 billion in sales for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 alone. Expected sales were 50% higher than consensus estimates of $7.15 billion. It‚Äôs been a banner year for chipmakers, parts of the tech industry and the Nasdaq, driven in part by the AI frenzy and the possibility of slowing Federal Reserve rate hikes. Alongside Nvidia, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft were also buoyed in last week‚Äôs trading.  Nvidia‚Äôs graphics processing units, or GPUs, are critical to generative AI platforms like OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT and Google‚Äôs Bard. The company has historically been a leader in the so-called ‚Äúdiscrete‚Äù or standalone GPU field, but until recently, many consumers thought of GPUs as primarily used for intensive gaming. The advent of crypto mining and AI has upended that belief, and GPU manufacturers and suppliers, including Nvidia, AMD and TSMC, have seen share prices rise significantly over the last few months. By contrast, Intel, which struggled with inventory issues and development challenges, has been historically focused on the chip market for central processing units, or CPUs.

[Exclusive: Nvidia pursues $30 billion custom chip opportunity with new unit -sources,;,;        SAN FRANCISCO, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Nvidia (NVDA.O), opens new tab is building a new business unit focused on designing bespoke chips for cloud computing firms and others, including advanced artificial intelligence (AI) processors, nine sources familiar with its plans told Reuters.  The dominant global designer and supplier of AI chips aims to capture a portion of an exploding market for custom AI chips and shield itself from the growing number of companies pursuing alternatives to its products.  The Santa Clara, California-based company controls about 80% of high-end AI chip market, a position that has sent its stock market value up 40% so far this year to $1.73 trillion after it more than tripled in 2023.  Nvidia's customers, which include ChatGPT creator OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT.O), opens new tab, Alphabet (GOOGL.O), opens new tab and Meta Platforms (META.O), opens new tab, have raced to snap up the dwindling supply of its chips to compete in the fast-emerging generative AI sector.  Its H100 and A100 chips serve as a generalized, all-purpose AI processor for many of those major customers. But the tech companies have started to develop their own internal chips for specific needs. Doing so helps reduce energy consumption, and potentially can shrink the cost and time to design.  Nvidia is now attempting to play a role in helping these companies develop custom AI chips that have flowed to rival firms such as Broadcom (AVGO.O), opens new tab and Marvell Technology (MRVL.O), opens new tab, said the sources, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.  "If you're really trying to optimize on things like power, or optimize on cost for your application, you can't afford to go drop an H100 or A100 in there," Greg Reichow, general partner at venture capital firm Eclipse Ventures said in an interview. "You want to have the exact right mixture of compute and just the kind of compute that you need."  Nvidia does not disclose H100 prices, which are higher than for the prior-generation A100, but each chip can sell for $16,000 to $100,000 depending on volume and other factors. Meta plans to bring its total stock to 350,000 H100s this year. Nvidia officials have met with representatives from Amazon.com (AMZN.O), opens new tab, Meta, Microsoft, Google and OpenAI to discuss making custom chips for them, two sources familiar with the meetings said. Beyond data center chips, Nvidia has pursued telecom, automotive and video game customers.  Nvidia shares rose 2.75% after the Reuters report, helping lift chip stocks overall. Marvell shares dropped 2.78%.  In 2022, Nvidia said it would let third-party customers integrate some of its proprietary networking technology with their own chips. It has said nothing about the program since, and Reuters is reporting its wider ambitions for the first time. A Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment beyond the company's 2022 announcement.  Dina McKinney, a former Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), opens new tab and Marvell executive, heads Nvidia's custom unit and her team's goal is to make its technology available for customers in cloud, 5G wireless, video games and automotives, a LinkedIn profile said. Those mentions were scrubbed and her title changed after Reuters sought comment from Nvidia.  Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI declined to comment.     **$30 BILLION MARKET**  According to estimates from research firm 650 Group‚Äôs Alan Weckel, the data center custom chip market will grow to as much as $10 billion this year, and double that in 2025.  The broader custom chip market was worth roughly $30 billion in 2023, which amounts to roughly 5% of annual global chip sales, according to Needham analyst Charles Shi.  Currently, custom silicon design for data centers is dominated by Broadcom and Marvell.  In a typical arrangement, a design partner such as Nvidia would offer intellectual property and technology, but leave the chip fabrication, packaging and additional steps to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (2330.TW), opens new tab or another contract chip manufacturer.  Nvidia moving into this territory has the potential to eat into Broadcom and Marvell sales.  "With Broadcom's custom silicon business touching $10 billion, and Marvell‚Äôs around $2 billion, this is a real threat," said Dylan Patel, founder of silicon research group SemiAnalysis. "It's a real big negative - there's more competition entering the fray."  **BEYOND AI**  Nvidia is in talks with telecom infrastructure builder Ericsson (ERICb.ST), opens new tab for a wireless chip that includes the chip designer's graphics processing unit (GPU) technology, two sources familiar with the discussions said. Ericsson declined to comment.  650 Group's Weckle expects the telecom custom chip market to remain flat at roughly $4 billion to $5 billion a year. Nvidia also plans to target the automotive and video game markets, according to sources and public social media postings.  Weckel expects the custom auto market to grow consistently from its current $6 billion to $8 billion range at 20% a year, and the $7 billion to $8 billion video game custom chip market could increase with the next-generation consoles from Xbox and Sony (6857.T), opens new tab.

[The world's wealthiest people have seen their fortunes grow by more than $150 billion thanks to the AI-fueled stock-market boom,;,; * AI-related stocks have seen a spectacular surge in 2023, following ChatGPT's smashing debut.     * Some of the world's wealthiest people have made a killing from the rally.     * Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and Oracle boss Larry Ellison have seen their personal fortunes swell by over $40 billion each.  Artificial intelligence has been one of the defining themes for stocks in 2023 ‚Äì and it's also helping the rich get richer.        The surge in interest in the intelligent language tool ChatGPT quickly spread across markets, with big-name investors rushing to snap up shares in companies they believe could power AI's rise to prominence.        Big Tech giants like Meta Platforms and Nvidia have already racked up triple-digit gains thanks to the AI boom, while Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, and Oracle have also all surged.        That's helped the companies' founders ‚Äì already among the world's richest people at the start of 2023 ‚Äì to become even wealthier.  Meta shares have rallied 134% year-to-date thanks to both the rise of AI and Zuckerberg's so-called "year of efficiency" cost cuts, and that's lifted the Facebook founder's wealth by over $57 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.        Meanwhile, Oracle founder Larry Ellison passed Bill Gates on the publication's rich list for the first time ever earlier this week, with his fortune up $47 billion in 2023 thanks to the tech stock's 55% gain.        Gates himself has gotten $24 billion richer this year thanks to his Microsoft shares, with the Redmond-based tech giant emerging as a preferred AI play for billionaire investors including Stanley Druckenmiller.        And the man at the helm of one of the stock market's biggest success story of 2023 ‚Äì Nvidia founder Jensen Huang ‚Äì has also seen his personal fortune balloon by $24 billion, according to Bloomberg's index.  Again, that's largely thanks to Huang's shares in the chipmaker, which have jumped 192% in value to lift the company to a $1 trillion market capitalization.        The members of the rich list have seen their combined wealth jump by over $150 billion in 2023, by Insider's calculations.,;,; 2023-06-20 06:06:37]
[Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..),;,; From     The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the "magnificent seven" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.  The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.  The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to "address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights."  The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.  The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.   How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted? The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.  The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.  The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.  Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.  Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.  Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.  Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.  Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.  How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut? Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.  Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.  The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.  Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023 The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.  This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.  There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.  Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices? The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.  However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&amp;P 500, which is why S&amp;P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.  The S&amp;P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.  Most of the "magnificent 7" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.  The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.  Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.,;,; 2023-07-10 20:25:37]
[Microsoft and Meta expand their AI partnership with Llama 2 on Azure and Windows,;,;   In recent months, the remarkable strides made in AI innovation have ignited a wave of transformative possibilities, captivating our collective imagination with the promise of reshaping industries and the way we work. Today, at Microsoft Inspire, Meta and Microsoft announced support for the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs) on Azure and Windows. Llama 2 is designed to enable developers and organizations to build generative AI-powered tools and experiences. Meta and Microsoft share a commitment to democratizing AI and its benefits and we are excited that Meta is taking an open approach with Llama 2. We offer developers choice in the types of models they build on, supporting open and frontier models and are thrilled to be Meta‚Äôs preferred partner as they release their new version of Llama 2 to commercial customers for the first time.  Now Azure customers can fine-tune and deploy the 7B, 13B, and 70B-parameter Llama 2 models easily and more safely on Azure, the platform for the most widely adopted frontier and open models. In addition, Llama will be optimized to run locally on Windows. Windows developers will be able to use Llama by targeting the DirectML execution provider through the ONNX Runtime, allowing a seamless workflow as they bring generative AI experiences to their applications.,;,; 2023-07-18 16:12:17]
[Powerhouse Picks: META, AMZN, or NFLX - Unveiling the most compelling FAANG stock,;,;    # Meta Platforms ($META)  Shares of social media giant Meta Platforms have rallied by a phenomenal 107% year-to-date. The company impressed investors by returning back to revenue growth in the first quarter (after three straight quarters of decline) despite subdued digital ad spending due to macro pressures.  Investors have also cheered the company‚Äôs aggressive cost-cutting and streamlining efforts, including thousands of layoffs. Despite the distraction caused by regulatory matters, most Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about Meta‚Äôs prospects.  Meta‚Äôs user base continues to expand, with daily active people (number of users who visited at least one of the family apps ‚ÄìFacebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp in a day) growing 5% year-over-year to 3.02 billion (on average) in March. The company expects capital expenditure of $30 billion to $33 billion this year toward the build-out of its artificial intelligence (AI) capacity to support ads, Feed, and Reels as well as increased investment in generative AI initiatives.  **Is Meta a Good Stock to Buy?**  On Tuesday, Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion reiterated a Buy rating on Meta Platforms stock with a price target of $270 after taking a deep look at the company‚Äôs AI capabilities.The analyst sees the company leveraging AI to boost user engagement, develop better and more automated advertiser tools, and create an open-source AI ecosystem. Champion is also optimistic about Meta‚Äôs positioning within the digital ads space.  ## Amazon ($AMZN)  Like Meta, Amazon is also reducing its costs to navigate a tough business backdrop. The company‚Äôs retail business has been under pressure due to the impact of macro challenges on consumer spending. Additionally, the slowdown in the growth rate of the higher-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) business has also been concerning. Enterprises are moderating their IT budgets, which is weighing on AWS‚Äôs growth.  Wall Street continues to be bullish on Amazon and sees solid potential in the retail and AWS divisions over the long term. Moreover, AMZN‚Äôs rapidly growing advertising business is also expected to boost revenue in the years ahead. Despite macro pressures, Amazon‚Äôs ad revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $9.5 billion in Q1.  **Is AMZN a Buy, Sell, or Hold?**  Earlier this week, Mizuho analyst James Lee increased his price target for Amazon to $160 from $145 and reiterated a Buy rating, calling the stock his top pick for the second half of 2023. The analyst expects multiple expansion as concerns about the company‚Äôs AI market position ‚Äúdiminish.‚Äù  Recent channel checks by Lee‚Äôs firm with a leading channel partner indicated that AWS‚Äôs generative AI demand has been accelerating due to the ease of transition and product differentiation.  ‚ÄúCase studies show that AWS wins over clients on intelligence privacy and data security,‚Äù said Lee. Further, he also highlighted that generative AI is priced meaningfully higher than conventional computing, so it is expected to be both revenue and margin accretive to AWS. Consequently, Lee believes AWS revenue growth will likely trough in Q2 before rebounding in the second half of the year.  ## Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)  Netflix‚Äôs crackdown on password sharing has improved investor sentiment about the streaming giant. Password sharing has been a key concern for Netflix, especially as competition has become intense in the streaming space. Netflix had previously estimated that over 100 million households share accounts, representing 43% of its global user base. This week, Netflix rolled out its password-sharing crackdown to its home market.  Aside from the password-sharing crackdown, Netflix‚Äôs business is expected to improve through its recent introduction of a cheaper, ad-supported tier.  **What is the Price Target for Netflix?**  On Thursday, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein increased the price target for Netflix stock to $450 from $415 and maintained a Buy rating in reaction to the launch of paid sharing offering at $7.99 per additional household stream.  Prior to the announcement, the analyst‚Äôs firm conducted a survey of 1,800 U.S. Netflix consumers. The survey indicated a healthy propensity to pay for ‚Äúremote‚Äù users, with certain abandoned users willing to pay for their own subscriptions.  While 45% of respondents indicated a willingness to pay for ‚Äúremote‚Äù users, 70% indicated an inclination for the $6.99 ad-tier plan. With pricing of the paid sharing option above the ad-tier, the survey suggests a significant portion of these users will be pushed toward the ad-based offer.  # Conclusion  Wall Street is more bullish on Meta Platforms and Amazon compared to Netflix. Given the massive rally in Meta stock, Wall Street sees higher upside potential in Amazon stock from current levels. Analysts mainly see solid potential in Amazon‚Äôs AWS cloud business, supported by solid demand for cloud computing and prospects for growth in the AI space.,;,; 2023-05-29 11:19:17]
[Snap plunges 25% on revenue miss and light guidance, as Middle East conflict creates ‚Äòheadwind‚Äô,;,; Snap reported revenue that trailed analysts‚Äô estimates on Tuesday and issued a forecast that came in a bit below Wall Street expectations. The stock plunged 20% in extended trading.  Here‚Äôs how the company did:  Earnings per share: 8 cents, adjusted, vs. 6 cents expected by analysts, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv.  Revenue: $1.36 billion vs. $1.38 billion expected, according to LSEG.  Global Daily Active Users: 414 million vs. 412 million expected, according to StreetAccount.  Average revenue per user: $3.29 vs. $3.33 expected, according to StreetAccount.   Snap has struggled to rebound from the downturn in the digital ad market, and has now reported six straight quarters of single-digit growth or sales declines. For the fourth quarter, revenue rose about 5% year-over-year to $1.36 billion from $1.3 billion a year earlier.  For the second consecutive period, Snap attributed some of the weakness to the war in the Middle East, which erupted in October beginning with Hamas‚Äôs attack on Israel.  ‚ÄúWhile we are encouraged by the progress we are making with our ad platform and the improved results we are delivering for many of our advertising partners, we estimate that the onset of the conflict in the Middle East was a headwind to year-over-year growth of approximately 2 percentage points in Q4,‚Äù Snap said in a letter to investors.  Growth is expected to accelerate in the first quarter, but not quite as fast as analysts were expecting. Snap forecast sales for the quarter of $1.095 billion to $1.135 billion, representing about 11% growth at the midpoint of the range, which was $1.115 billion. Analysts were looking for revenue of $1.117 billion.  Daily active users for the first quarter will be 420 million, Snap said, slightly topping analyst estimates of 419.3 million.  Earlier this week, Snap said it would cut 10% of its global workforce, which equates to about 500 employees. A company spokesperson told CNBC in a statement that the cuts were intended to reorganize staff and ‚Äúreduce hierarchy and promote in-person collaboration.‚Äù In mid-2022, Snap eliminated about 1,000 employees, or 20% of its fulltime workforce.  Snap‚Äôs net loss for the quarter narrowed to $248.2 million, or 15 cents a share, which represents a 14% year-over-year decrease from $288.5 million, or 18 cents a share.  Snap said it expects an adjusted EBITDA loss between $55 million to $95 million in the first quarter, higher than analyst projections of $21.9 million. Last quarter, Snap issued an ‚Äúinternal forecast‚Äù for the fourth quarter instead of providing official guidance because of ‚Äúthe unpredictable nature of war,‚Äù referring to the Israel-Hamas war.  Snap on Tuesday disclosed sales its its Snapchat+ subscription service for the first time and said it had an annualized revenue run rate of $249 million in 2023. The service now has 7 million subscribers, up from five million in the previous quarter. Snap introduced the product in 2022, pitching it as a way for users to access early features. It came debuted that summer for $3.99 a month.  Snap‚Äôs growth in the fourth quarter lagged larger digital ad rivals like Meta, Amazon and Alphabet, which all reported double-digit expansion in their advertising units.  Snap and Pinterest are ‚Äúmuch smaller companies that have struggled to build substantial ad businesses, Debra Aho Williamson, an industry analyst, told CNBC. ‚ÄúIn this environment, the big are getting bigger,‚Äù  Last week, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel attended a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on child safety and technology alongside Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,  X CEO Linda Yaccarino, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew and Discord CEO Jason Citron. Lawmakers grilled the executives, accusing them of failing to properly safeguard their respective platforms from child predators, among other concerns.  Source:  2024-02-06 21:16:53]

[Snap stock surges on report that Biden may ban TikTok,;,; KEY POINTS  &gt;Snap shares surged nearly 8% to $11.15 while Meta shares rose a little over 3% to $203.49 after The Wall Street Journal reported that TikTok faces a possible ban in the U.S. if ByteDance fails to comply with the Biden Administration's proposition.  &gt;Investors believe that if TikTok were to be banned in the U.S., social media companies like Snapchat and Meta would regain users lost to the short-form video platform.  &gt;ByteDance said in a statement that "If protecting national security is the objective, divestment doesn't solve the problem: a change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access."   2023-03-16 05:50:49]
[iPhone sales slow down: Apple to see sharpest fall in revenue since 2016 as analysts stress on AI to boost growth,;,; Apple is expected to witness a decline in iPhone sales during the April-June quarter, attributed to cautious consumer behaviour in a slow economy as the launch of a new model is anticipated. As the tech giant prepares to release its earnings report, analysts emphasise the significance of revealing its utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI) to boost growth.  Apple, the world's most valuable company, is projected to experience a 1.6% dip in total quarterly revenue, which would mark its sharpest decrease in third-quarter revenue since 2016, according to Refinitiv. Specifically, iPhone sales are anticipated to have declined by over 2% during this period, based on a survey of 24 analysts conducted by Visible Alpha. This contrasts with a nearly 3% increase in sales during the same quarter last year and a 1.5% rise in the preceding quarter (January-March).  The upcoming quarterly report may serve as a deviation from the positive earnings trend observed in other prominent tech companies such as Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Microsoft. These companies have demonstrated resilience in their cloud-based operations and have witnessed a surge in digital ad sales. "Apple is not immune to general macroeconomic trends and will continue to set the pace (for the smartphone industry) for quite some time," Reuters quoted Bob O'Donnell, founder of TECHnalysis Research, as saying. In September, analysts anticipate the unveiling of the much-anticipated iPhone 15, which could feature the widely accepted USB-C port on certain models. This development may provide a slight boost to iPhone sales during the July-September quarter, according to market experts, who have differing opinions on the overall performance during this period.  Notably, Apple has a tradition of not providing quarterly outlooks. However, industry analysts speculate that the tech giant might shed light on its utilisation of AI to enhance the upcoming product lineup, offering insights into the company's innovative approach.,;,; 2023-08-02 01:27:57]
[Microsoft stock hits a record high. Why its next move might be lower,;,; Microsoft stock reached a new all-time closing high‚Äîbut there could be some hiccups ahead in the short term.        Microsoft's stock rose 1.1% to $360.53 on Tuesday. That's a new closing high, topping the previous high of $359.49 set on July 18. Furthermore, Microsoft has won for eight days in a row, its longest winning streak since January 28, 2021.        The stock has been helped by the company‚Äôs strong earnings and sales, which got a boost from the Azure cloud business.        But it‚Äôs not just earnings. Microsoft was already outperforming its peers following tech weakness in August and September. Its stock has gained 15% since the end of September, outpacing Amazon.com (AMZN), which has risen 12%, Meta Platforms (META), which has risen 6.5%, Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), which is up 6%, Alphabet (GOOGL) which has ticked up 0.3%, and Tesla (TSLA), which has dropped 13%.        So, why be concerned? It all comes down to the 14-day relative strength index from Microsoft. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a measure of a stock's or index's momentum, or lack thereof. The closer it comes to 20 on the negative, the more oversold it is, while a score close to 80 indicates that the stock is extremely overbought. A value below 30 usually indicates that a stock is about to rally, while a score above 60 indicates a likely decline. Microsoft's RSI is at 72.75, indicating that it is becoming quite overbought and that a pullback is possible.        That doesn‚Äôt mean Microsoft isn‚Äôt worth buying for its long-term potential. The company has a lot to recommend, including a cloud business that should get a boost as ChatGPT, which held its developer conference yesterday, looks to expand. It just means that investors might get a better opportunity to pick up shares in the days ahead.        ,;,; 2023-11-08 11:35:51]

[Meta‚Äôs AR/VR roadmap for the next four years: three new Quest headsets, AR glasses in 2027, and a ‚Äòneural interface‚Äô smartwatch,;,; This is Meta‚Äôs AR/VR hardware roadmap for the next four years  During an internal presentation, Meta execs laid out plans for three new Quest headsets, AR glasses in 2027, and a ‚Äòneural interface‚Äô smartwatch.  Meta plans to release its first pair of smart glasses with a display in 2025 alongside a neural interface smartwatch designed to control them, The Verge has learned. Meanwhile, its first pair of full-fledged AR glasses, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg has predicted will eventually be as widely used as mobile phones, is planned for 2027.  The details were shared with thousands of employees in Meta‚Äôs Reality Labs division on Tuesday during a roadmap presentation of its AR and VR efforts that was shared with The Verge. Altogether, they show how Meta is planning to keep investing in consumer hardware after a series of setbacks and broader cost cutting across the company. A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment for this story.  With regards to the VR roadmap, employees were told that Meta‚Äôs flagship Quest 3 headset coming later this year will be two times thinner, at least twice as powerful, and cost slightly more than the $400 Quest 2. Like the recently announced Quest Pro, it will prominently feature mixed reality experiences that don‚Äôt fully immerse the wearer, thanks to front-facing cameras that pass through video of the real world. Meta has sold nearly 20 million Quest headsets to date, Mark Rabkin, the company‚Äôs vice president for VR, told employees during the presentation.  (I‚Äôll have more from this meeting and my thoughts about Meta‚Äôs roadmap in Thursday‚Äôs issue of my newsletter Command Line.)  Three new Quest models   Meta‚Äôs main challenge with the Quest 3, which is internally codenamed Stinson, will be convincing people to pay ‚Äúa bit more‚Äù money than the cost of the existing Quest 2, according to Rabkin. ‚ÄúWe have to get enthusiasts fired up about it,‚Äù he told employees Tuesday. ‚ÄúWe have to prove to people that all this power, all these new features are worth it.‚Äù  Meta has sold nearly 20 million Quest headsets to date  Mixed reality will be a huge selling point, and Rabkin said there will be a new ‚Äúsmart guardian‚Äù to help wearers navigate the real world while they are wearing the device. ‚ÄúThe main north star for the team was from the moment you put on this headset, the mixed reality has to make it feel better, easier, more natural,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou can walk effortlessly through your house knowing you can see perfectly well. You can put anchors and things on your desktop. You can take your coffee. You can stay in there much longer.‚Äù  There will be 41 new apps and games shipping for the Quest 3, including new mixed reality experiences to take advantage of the updated hardware, Rabkin said. In 2024, he said that Meta plans to ship a more ‚Äúaccessible‚Äù headset codenamed Ventura. ‚ÄúThe goal for this headset is very simple: pack the biggest punch we can at the most attractive price point in the VR consumer market.‚Äù  Rabkin didn‚Äôt say whether a second generation of the recent Meta Quest Pro, which received poor reviews from The Verge and others, is coming anytime soon. The closest to what sounds like a successor will be ‚Äúway out in the future‚Äù after Ventura in 2024, when Meta is planning its most advanced headset codenamed La Jolla featuring photorealistic, codec avatars.  ‚ÄúWe want to make it higher resolution for work use and really nail work, text and things like that,‚Äù Rabkin said about La Jolla. ‚ÄúWe want to take a lot of the comfort things from Quest Pro and how it sits on your head and the split architecture and bring that in for comfort.‚Äù  Meanwhile, he acknowledged that the current Quest is struggling to keep new users engaged. ‚ÄúRight now, we‚Äôre on our third year of Quest 2,‚Äù he told employees. ‚ÄúAnd sadly, the newer cohorts that are coming in, the people who bought it this last Christmas, they‚Äôre just not as into it‚Äù or engaged as ‚Äúthe ones who bought it early.‚Äù  Rabkin pushed employees to make the sharing of VR content on other platforms ‚Äútrivial,‚Äù redesign the Quest store to make it more ‚Äúdynamic,‚Äù and give developers the ability to do things like automated promotions.  The current Quest is struggling to keep new users engaged  ‚ÄúWe need to be better at growth and retention and resurrection,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need to be better at social and actually make those things more reliable, more intuitive so people can count on it.‚Äù   Even with these struggles, Meta has built an early lead in virtual reality hardware. But its big swings over the coming years speak to the serious competition that‚Äôs about to arrive. Apple is expected to announce a high-end virtual reality headset sometime this year, while Sony just released the well-received PSVR 2 for console gamers. Meanwhile, Apple, Google, Snap, and others are all racing toward something even bigger: augmented reality glasses ‚Äî and that‚Äôs where Meta is hoping its early efforts in the mixed reality space will really pay off.  AR glasses and neural interfaces   A demo from late 2021 illustrates how Meta imagines AR glasses could work to let someone play chess with a hologram. A demo from late 2021 illustrates how Meta imagines AR glasses could work to let someone play chess with a hologram. Image: Metanone  Aside from the Quest lineup, Meta also has thousands of employees building future AR glasses and wrist devices for controlling them. The key difference from VR is that the company intends for AR glasses to eventually be worn throughout the day as a replacement for smartphones. Zuckerberg has called them the ‚Äúholy grail‚Äù device that will ‚Äúredefine our relationship with technology‚Äù by the end of this decade.  During Tuesday‚Äôs roadmap presentation, Alex Himel, the company‚Äôs vice president for AR, laid out the plan for a bevy of devices through 2027. The first launch will come this fall with the second generation of Meta‚Äôs camera-equipped smart glasses it released in 2021 with Luxottica, the parent company of Ray-Ban.  In 2025, Himel said the third generation of the smart glasses will ship with a display that he called a ‚Äúviewfinder‚Äù for viewing incoming text messages, scanning QR codes, and translating text from another language in real time. The glasses will come with a ‚Äúneural interface‚Äù band that allows the wearer to control the glasses through hand movements, such as swiping fingers on an imaginary D-pad.  Eventually, he said the band will let the wearer use a virtual keyboard and type at the same words per minute as what mobile phones allow.  The smartwatch will integrate with Meta‚Äôs social media apps and offer health and fitness features  While Meta canned its plans for a smartwatch with a detachable display and cameras, it‚Äôs still working on another smartwatch to accompany its 2025 glasses, Himel confirmed.  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want people to have to choose between an input device on their wrist and smartwatch functionality that they‚Äôve come to love,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo we are building a neural interfaces watch. Number one, this device will do input: input to control your glasses, input to control the functionality on your wrist, and input to control the world around you.‚Äù  Himel showed employees a demo of the glasses in which, during a video call, the cameras on the glasses were showing the wearer‚Äôs front-facing perspective at the same time as a selfie view was being shown from the camera on the watch. He said the smartwatch will be an optional upgrade from a paired-down neural band that comes with the glasses, and that it will also integrate with Meta‚Äôs social media apps like WhatsApp and offer health and fitness features.

Photo by Amanda Lopez for The Vergenone  Meta‚Äôs first true pair of AR glasses, which the company has been internally developing for 8 years under the codename Orion, are more technically advanced, expensive, and designed to project high-quality holograms of avatars onto the real world. There will be an ‚Äúinternal launch‚Äù for employees to test the glasses in 2024, according to Himel. A version won‚Äôt be released to the public until 2027, when Meta will launch what Himel called its ‚ÄúInnovation‚Äù line of AR glasses for early adopters alongside a ‚ÄúScale‚Äù line of the less advanced smart glasses and the second generation of its neural smartwatch.  Himel framed the market opportunity around the almost two billion pairs of regular glasses and hundreds of millions of smartwatches that are sold each year. ‚ÄúIf we can put on shelves a great product at a great price with the right value, we believe we can get into these upgrade cycles and have a lot of growth of our devices,‚Äù he told the room. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs on us to deliver.‚Äù   ‚ÄúA business unlike anything we‚Äôve seen on mobile phones before‚Äù  Meta is planning to rely on its existing business model of advertising to help it make money off these future devices. Himel said the company thinks it can make a higher average revenue per user than what it makes currently in social media, thanks to a combination of selling virtual goods, optional add-ons like cloud backups, and AR ads.  ‚ÄúWe should be able to run a very good ads business,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs easy to imagine how ads would show up in space when you have AR glasses on. Our ability to track conversions, which is where there has been a lot of focus as a company, should also be close to 100 percent.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre hitting anything near projections, it will be a tremendous business,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA business unlike anything we‚Äôve seen on mobile phones before.‚Äù,;,; 2023-03-01 16:10:46]
[Google parent Alphabet‚Äôs stock hit with two downgrades this week,;,; In his research note, Shmulik said Alphabet‚Äôs ‚Äúnarrative has caught up with the fundamentals.‚Äù In other words, the stock is priced to match the company‚Äôs current performance and outlook. He also raised concerns about the way market sentiment went negative on the company after OpenAI announced ChatGPT in Nov. 2022 only to turn positive when the tech titan debuted its own generative AI software in May.        ‚ÄúWhat do we imagine would happen then, in any of the next 2-4 quarters, if Google Search numbers were to come in 'soft'? We imagine investors may once again ring the alarm bells around AI-related risks to Google's Search moat,‚Äù Shmulik wrote.  The analysts also pointed to Google‚Äôs Search Generative Experience (SGE) as a potential headwind for the company‚Äôs search advertising business. SGE is Google‚Äôs experimental generative AI-powered search platform. Like Microsoft‚Äôs Bing, it uses generative AI to provide users with answers to specific queries. The problem, the analysts say, is that the generative AI responses occupy screen space that is currently used to serve ads on the normal Google Search page.  ‚ÄúWe recognize that \[Google‚Äôs\] SGE roll-out is still in its very early stages (limited beta in the US only), with the integration of ads still being figured out,‚Äù Walmsley wrote in a research note. ‚ÄúBut our initial testing of SGE shows material changes to \[search engine results page\] vs. the ‚Äòold‚Äô Google‚Ä¶which we see as demonstrative of the potential disruption to Google's well-oiled Search monetization machine.‚Äù        Google is also increasingly facing challenges from the likes of Meta and Amazon in the digital advertising space. TikTok is also quickly playing a larger role in the industry. Increased spending on generative AI technologies could also cut into Alphabet‚Äôs margins.        The company is also staring down a slew of regulatory challenges including calls by the European Union‚Äôs European Commission to break up Google‚Äôs massive advertising business, which the commission says violates antitrust laws.,;,; 2023-06-28 10:09:27]
[Google commits to invest $2 billion in OpenAI competitor Anthropic,;,; Google agreed to invest up to $2 billion in Anthropic, the artificial intelligence startup founded by ex-OpenAI executives, CNBC has confirmed. The commitment involves a $500 million upfront cash infusion and an additional $1.5 billion to be invested over time, an Anthropic spokesperson told CNBC. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on the planned financing. A Google spokesperson didn‚Äôt immediately respond to request for comment.  Anthropic is the developer of Claude 2, a rival chatbot to OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT that‚Äôs used by companies including Slack, Notion and Quora. The company was founded in 2021 and, in addition to Google, has received funding from Salesforce and Zoom and was valued earlier this year at $4.1 billion. Claude 2 has the ability to summarize up to about 75,000 words, which could be the length of a book. Users can input large data sets and ask for summaries in the form of a memo, letter or story. ChatGPT, by contrast, can handle about 3,000 words.  Research by Arthur AI, a machine learning monitoring platform, found Claude 2 to be most reliable chatbot in terms of ‚Äúself-awareness,‚Äù meaning accurately gauging what it does and doesn‚Äôt know, and answering only questions it had training data to support. Arthur AI tested chatbots from Meta, Cohere and OpenAI.  In April, Google invested $300 million in the company, taking a 10% stake. That same month, Anthropic was one of four companies invited to a meeting at the White House to discuss responsible AI development with Vice President Kamala Harris. Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and OpenAI were the others.  Anthropic quickly turned around and raised a $450 million round in May. At the time, it marked the largest funding round for an AI company since Microsoft‚Äôs investment in OpenAI in January, according to PitchBook data.Anthropic was founded by Dario Amodei, OpenAI‚Äôs former vice president of research, and his sister, Daniela Amodei, who was OpenAI‚Äôs vice president of safety and policy. Several other OpenAI research alumni were also on Anthropic‚Äôs founding team.  Amodei told CNBC in July that Anthropic invested at least two months in developing its newest chatbot, with a team of 30 to 35 people working directly on the AI model and a total of 150 people supporting it. She said the market is growing so rapidly that there‚Äôs plenty of room for multiple players to succeed.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a really unusual time from a business perspective because there‚Äôs just so much demand for large language models and really more demand than the industry can currently provide,‚Äù Amodei said at the time. ‚ÄúThe landscape is just very wide, and there‚Äôs really quite a lot of room for many different users and types of users to make use of these systems.‚Äù   2023-10-28 08:01:16]
[(Bloomberg) Apple Vision Pro deliveries are delayed to March,;,; "*Apple Inc. began taking preorders for its long-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Friday, and early indications suggest that buyers are snapping up initial supplies of the $3,499 device.*         *The product went on sale at 8 a.m. Eastern time on Apple‚Äôs website and mobile app, ahead of its rollout on Feb. 2. Delivery dates for all three models quickly slipped to March 8-15 for online orders, and the device was sold out for in-store pickup on day one at many locations. The delay signals that either demand is strong or supplies are limited ‚Äî or something in between.*  *Apple shares gained as much as 1.8% to $191.95 Friday in New York, erasing most of its 2% decline for January.*         *With the launch, the company disclosed two additional configurations: a version with 512 gigabytes of storage for $3,699, and a top-end model with 1 terabyte of space for $3,899. The base model includes 256 gigabytes of storage. The company also said it would sell a carrying case for $199 and additional batteries for $199, while extra bands will cost $99 a piece.*         *The purchasing process for the Vision Pro is unique. Customers need to use a recent iPhone or iPad to scan their head and, if necessary, provide a vision prescription. Apple typically doesn‚Äôt comment on the sales performance of new products.*    *Wall Street analysts are predicting a slow start for the device. UBS Group AG analyst David Vogt expects Apple to ship 300,000 to 400,000 units this year, generating as much as $1.4 billion. For a company that had sales of $383 billion last year, that‚Äôs ‚Äúimmaterial.‚Äù*  *Still, the idea is to set the stage for something bigger. Apple is entering its first major new product category since the company began selling smartwatches in 2015, and the Vision Pro may take years to catch on. Apple will continue to refine the headset ‚Äî making it cheaper and more comfortable ‚Äî and find compelling applications for the device.*        *In the longer run, Apple could use a fresh moneymaker. The smartphone market has matured, and it‚Äôs under particular pressure in China. The company‚Äôs revenue has fallen for four straight quarters ‚Äî its longest streak of declines in more than two decades.*  *Initially, the Cupertino, California-based company only plans to sell the Vision Pro in the US, with launches in other markets coming in the months ahead. The company is eyeing the UK, Canada and China as some of the first other countries, Bloomberg News has reported.*        *It‚Äôs a complex product to manufacture, which could limit early supplies. The dual 4K resolution displays in the headset, which melds virtual and augmented reality, have suffered production snags. But the fact that Apple has been ramping up manufacturing for months suggests that it will be able to satisfy initial demand. The company is also offering a 25% discount on the device for employees, signaling that supplies aren‚Äôt too tight.*  *Inside Apple, executives are anticipating a strong opening weekend, with sales tapering off later. At $3,499, the Vision Pro is one of the priciest consumer headsets ever ‚Äî about seven times more expensive than the latest device from VR market leader Meta Platforms Inc.*        *The Vision Pro also will be a hard product to share with family and friends. It requires a precise fitting process to ensure a good experience. The face scan is designed to determine the best light seal and strap size for users. The company has prepared 25 different light seals ‚Äî a cushion that prevents light from seeping into the wearer‚Äôs field of view ‚Äî in addition to two straps. There also are prescription lens inserts, at an additional cost.*         *And the headset may be hard for some people to wear for extended periods. In early testing, some users have found it to be too heavy.*        *Another concern that‚Äôs cropped up in recent days is a lack of support from top streaming apps. Netflix Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Google‚Äôs YouTube are opting not to release software for the device, at least at launch.*        *But Apple has carefully refined its sales pitch for the headset. When consumers try it out at Apple retail stores, they‚Äôll get a 25-minute demo, letting them get comfortable with the 3D experience that the company calls ‚Äúspatial computing.‚Äù*        *To commemorate the launch, Apple executives Mike Rockwell and Alan Dye discussed the device in a Q&amp;A shared with employees this week.*        *A key focus, said Dye, was ensuring that the Vision Pro didn‚Äôt have a closed-in feel ‚Äî a complaint with VR headsets.*        *‚ÄúFrom the onset, we all had concerns about people sitting with their eyes covered and disconnected from the world,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt really became central to how we thought about the core principles of the product.‚Äù*        *That led to the EyeSight system, which can show a wearer‚Äôs eyes through a screen on the front of the Vision Pro. ‚ÄúIt was a huge technical challenge to do this in a way that looks and feels natural,‚Äù Rockwell said.*        *Apple also developed an interface that doesn‚Äôt require handheld accessories. Instead, it tracks eye movement and hand gestures. Users control the device by looking at an on-screen item and pinching their fingers together to select it.*        *One of the biggest selling points may be how easy it makes collaboration, Rockwell said. Users in far-flung locations can feel like they‚Äôre in the same place.*        *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the closest thing to being there in person that you can possibly have,‚Äù Rockwell said. ‚ÄúIt changes the way you collaborate and is very different from videoconferencing as we know it.‚Äù*  .................................  *  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2024-01-21 15:15:31]

In the week through Jan. 30, a ratio of bulls to bears identified in an Investors Intelligence survey of newsletter writers hit its highest since around mid-2021, months before stocks neared their prior peak, Yardeni Research analysis shows.*  *‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a ‚Äòrah-rah‚Äô mob mentality in the stock market, with some traders drunk on their own wine,‚Äù betting on Fed easing as soon as March and upwards of six cuts this year, said Nick Giacoumakis, president of NEIRG Wealth Management. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrealistic. If you keep buying Big Tech stocks at these levels, you‚Äôre asking for trouble.‚Äù*  *This month is off to a banner start, with the market wrapping up its 13th gain in 14 weeks. The S&amp;P 500 hasn‚Äôt seen a streak like that since 1986.*  *Solid earnings from Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. drove the strength at the end of last week, after Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. released results that fell sort of investor expectations on AI.*  *February has a tendency to start on a high note, although the strength typically fades around mid-month as investors book profits, according to Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac. That‚Äôs particularly the case if stocks get a boost in January ‚Äî like they often do ‚Äî following tax-loss harvesting in December.*  *For the skittish camp, the latest signals from the Fed are a source of angst.*  *Fed Chair Jerome Powell suggested last week that the central bank wasn‚Äôt about to lower rates anytime soon, and that was before Friday‚Äôs blockbuster jobs report. After that data, swaps traders chopped the probability of a March rate cut to around 20%, and no longer see a May reduction as a done deal.*  *For some would-be dip-buyers, that raises red flags, especially with the latest Deutsche Bank AG data showing that aggregate equity positioning among rules-based and discretionary funds is in the top quarter of observations going back to 2010. The bullish skew raises questions over who‚Äôs left to buy after fund managers piled into stocks at a furious pace in November, December and January.*  *‚ÄúI really hope we get a correction in the stock market soon,‚Äù said Nancy Tengler, chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. ‚ÄúA selloff may not feel good at first, but I have a lot of money that I want to put to work for my clients.‚Äù*  *She plans to use any pullback to add shares of Palo Alto Networks Inc., Microsoft and Amazon.*  *At NEIRG Wealth, Giacoumakis said he owns megacap tech stocks, which have driven the bulk of the market‚Äôs advance over the past year, but he isn‚Äôt adding to his position due to lofty valuations.*  *Members of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies, the biggest firms in the S&amp;P 500 ‚Äî Apple Inc., Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. ‚Äî carry a 33% premium to the index in terms of forward price-to-earnings, data compiled by Bloomberg show.*  *Of course, sentiment can stay frothy for weeks ‚Äî even months ‚Äî before stocks suffer a significant drop, notes Hirsch at the Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac, who correctly called the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs double-digit rise in 2023.*  *Take 2021, he said: Back then, the ratio of bulls to bears in the Investors Intelligence survey was hovering at current levels for most of that year, while equities continued to rip higher.*  *‚ÄúStocks are ripe for a pullback soon, but nothing sinister,‚Äù said Hirsch, who sees the S&amp;P 500 potentially topping 5,000 this month before retreating to its prior high near 4,800 ‚Äî or a 4% drop.*  *‚ÄúMarket breadth is already lacking right now, with fewer stocks participating in this rally.‚Äù*,;,; 2024-02-09 18:49:32]

[NVDA shares have tripled in 2023, while the Nasdaq-100 has climbed 38% and the S&amp;P 500 has gained 16%,;,; AI Mania Triggers Dot-Com Bubble Flashbacks  Nvidia shares have nearly tripled this year. Investors question whether the stock can live up to the hype.  The dot-com bubble taught investors to be wary of stock-market rallies powered by a technological boom‚Äîthat is, until generative artificial intelligence sent tech stocks soaring this year.  Shares of Nvidia NVDA -0.39%, the graphics-chip maker at the heart of the frenzy, have nearly tripled in 2023, while the Nasdaq-100 has climbed 38% and the S&amp;P 500 has gained 16%.  For some investors, the surge in Nvidia‚Äînow the fifth-largest U.S. company by market value‚Äîis difficult to chalk up to anything but speculative mania. Its weighting in the benchmark stock indexes means everyday investors are at the whims of its trajectory, whether they believe in AI‚Äôs potential or not.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge boom in AI‚Äîsome people are scrambling to get exposure at any cost, while others are sounding the alarm that this will end in tears,‚Äù said Kai Wu, founder and chief investment officer of Sparkline Capital. ‚ÄúInvestors can benefit from innovation-led growth, but must be wary of overpaying for it.‚Äù  Nvidia is the primary producer of semiconductors backing artificial-intelligence systems. The company forecast a record $11 billion in sales for the recently ended quarter when it reported results in May, catching analysts off guard with the projected surge in customer demand.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when the excitement around AI really ramped up,‚Äù said Ryan McCormack, an Invesco senior exchange-traded fund strategist.   The hype has driven companies such as Meta Platforms and Amazon.com that have been building out AI capabilities, he said. Shares of the tech giants are up 154% and 65% in 2023, respectively. Microsoft, which has climbed 35%, has poured billions of dollars into OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, a chatbot that can answer difficult questions in seconds.  The furious rally in those stocks, long the market‚Äôs biggest drivers, has fanned worries about market concentration. The 10 biggest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 now comprise more than a third of the market, according to Dow Jones Market Data. They represented 27% of the index at the start of the year and less than a quarter in 2000.  ‚ÄúThe market story that rhymes most with the internet bubble is the concentration of leadership,‚Äù said Mike Edwards, deputy chief investment officer of Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers.  Nvidia‚Äôs second-quarter earnings report, due Aug. 23, will provide insight into whether its inexorable rise is well-rooted in demand for chips, or a product of hype. The stock gained 24% in the trading session after its earnings reported in May, and 14% the day following February‚Äôs results.  Investors are paying up for the shares, betting on a windfall down the line. Nvidia is trading at 41 times its sales from the last 12 months, according to FactSet, compared with 2.4 times sales for the S&amp;P 500. On a forward basis, the stock trades at 20 times its expected sales for the year ahead‚Äîdouble its average over the last decade of 10 times, according to Dow Jones Market Data.   The nascency of AI programs such as ChatGPT means it is likely too early to determine whether Nvidia can raise revenue in line with the eye-watering valuation investors have slapped on its shares. If the company‚Äôs growth isn‚Äôt enough to reflect its price, the stock could crater.  A basket of 43 high-multiple internet stocks‚Äîthose worth at least $5 billion that traded at 25 times their revenue at the turn of the century‚Äîcrashed 80% over the next two years, according to Sparkline.   The companies weren‚Äôt duds, either. Their sales grew 10-fold in the ensuing two decades. But investors were badly bruised from the bust: The shares returned an average of 16% in that time span. The S&amp;P 500 returned 284%.  The basket included Amazon and Microsoft, both darlings of today‚Äôs market, along with Cisco Systems, then one of the largest companies in the Nasdaq-100. The networking- equipment maker traded as high as 38 times its sales in early 2000. Cisco has returned 43% since the start of the century‚Äîit is down 0.4% when excluding dividends.  ‚ÄúValuations matter,‚Äù said Wu. ‚ÄúInvesting in stocks exposed to rapidly growing technologies only works if the growth is not already priced in. Unfortunately, in periods of euphoria, the market has a tendency not only to price in potential growth, but to greatly overextrapolate it.‚Äù  One reason why this rally might lack the boom-and-bust nature of the dot-com bubble: The beneficiaries of artificial intelligence were the stocks already shining this year. Investors were flocking to big tech in the first quarter, seeking shelter in strong balance sheets and cash flows.  Tech companies are also benefiting from the expected end of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest-rate campaign and resilient consumer spending. Cyclical sectors of the broader market have begun to catch up now that recession fears are fading.   ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like 1999 when investors were racing to hot IPOs for companies that had no chance of making money,‚Äù said Edwards. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs winners are disciplined, enormous companies that have moats in place and data sets to exploit.‚Äù,;,; 2023-08-11 12:53:17]
["Seize the bull's momentum: Embrace the remarkable growth potential of this 64% discounted stock!",;,; This e-commerce stock could soar when the economy regains its momentum and consumer spending rebounds.  The S&amp;P 500 fell into a bear market early last year as economic uncertainty weighed on investor sentiment. The situation has improved very little since then. High inflation and rising interest rates contributed to a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter of this year, and many experts believe the situation will culminate in a recession. But there is a silver lining for patient investors.   Bad news tends to create buying opportunities. The S&amp;P 500 is still down 13%, but history says the next bull market is coming. The benchmark index has recovered from every past bear market and recession, and investors have no reason to expect a different outcome this time.   But right now, Shopify (SHOP -1.07%) stock is down 64%, and trading at a discount to its historical valuation. That is a buying opportunity.  **Shopify is the market leader in e-commerce software**      Shopify simplifies commerce. Its software allows merchants to manage their businesses across physical stores and digital sales channels from a single dashboard. That includes online marketplaces like Amazon and social media like Facebook by Meta Platforms, but it also includes custom mobile apps and websites. Shopify also provides ancillary solutions for payments, logistics, and financing, and the Shopify App Store includes thousands of third-party integrations.        That turnkey approach to commerce has made Shopify popular with sellers, especially small and medium-sized businesses. Case in point: Shopify is the market leader in e-commerce software in terms of market presence and user satisfaction. But the company is also growing upmarket. Shopify Plus, a more sophisticated platform built for larger brands, is the most popular omnichannel commerce software on the market. That puts the company in a good position.  Ameco Research expects retail e-commerce sales to grow by 14% annually through 2030, and Grand View Research expects wholesale e-commerce sales to grow by 20% annually over the same period. Shopify will benefit from both tailwinds, but it should grow more quickly than either metric suggests due to its strong market presence and broad portfolio of adjacent merchant solutions.  **Shopify returned to profitability in the first quarter**      Shopify struggled with economic headwinds last year. Sales growth slowed as high inflation hindered consumer spending, and profitability evaporated as ongoing investments put upward pressure on operating costs. But Shopify regained some of its former momentum in the first quarter of this year. Revenue increased 25% to $1.5 billion, an acceleration from 22% growth in the prior year. The company also returned to GAAP profitability with a net income of $0.05 per share, up from a loss of $1.17 per share in the prior year.        Investors should also consider two additional metrics. Plus merchants accounted for 34% of monthly recurring revenue, up from 30% in the prior year, indicating that Shopify Plus continues to gain traction with larger brands. Additionally, Shopify reported an attach rate of 3.04%, up from 2.79% in the prior year. Attach rate is defined as revenue divided by gross merchandise volume and an increasing attach rate means merchants are upgrading to higher subscription tiers and adopting more adjacent services. In other words, Shopify is deepening its relationships with merchants, which makes it more likely those merchants will stick around in the future.        **Shopify stock is trading at a reasonable price**      Shopify is a compelling commerce partner for businesses of all sizes. Its ability to unify physical and digital sales channels behind a single dashboard gives the company an edge over rivals like Amazon. Moreover, Shopify is effectively a one-stop shop for commerce infrastructure due to its extensive portfolio of adjacent solutions.        The company also has a very capable management team. Shopify has consistently developed new products, and it recently sold its logistics business to Flexport. That was likely a difficult decision given the time and money it invested in the project, but it was the right decision. Shopify can now return to its core competency of building software solutions that simplify commerce. That should give investors confidence.   Shares currently trade at 13 times sales, a bargain compared to the three-year average of 32.3 times sales and a reasonable price to pay given Shopify's strong position in a growing market. That's why this growth stock is worth buying.,;,; 2023-05-22 10:09:09]

[Washington prepares for war with Amazon on mergers, antitrust, privacy and more,;,; The Biden administration is planning to take action soon on at least three of its half-dozen investigations of Amazon ‚Äî moves that could lead to a blitz of litigation to rein in the iconic tech-industry giant.  The FTC has been investigating the internet titan on multiple fronts dating at least back to 2019, looking into its abuse of power within its online marketplace, as well as potential consumer-privacy violations connected to its Ring cameras and Alexa digital assistant.  The agency is also reviewing Amazon‚Äôs purchase of robot vacuum maker iRobot. Any suit against Amazon would be a high-profile move by the agency under chair Lina Khan, a Big Tech skeptic who rose to prominence with a 2017 academic paper specifically identifying Amazon as a modern monopolist needing to be reined in.  Although Amazon has already been hit by local antitrust suits in Washington, D.C. and California, the coming federal cases would be the most significant challenges to the global company yet. The exact timing of any cases or settlements is unknown.  POLITICO spoke to more than 10 people with direct knowledge of the investigations by the FTC‚Äôs competition and consumer protection teams to put together a comprehensive picture of how the agency is now pursuing Amazon, why it didn‚Äôt take action on the company‚Äôs most recent major acquisition of One Medical and what is likely to happen in the coming months. According to those people, who were granted anonymity to discuss confidential investigations:  The FTC is currently weighing whether to challenge Amazon‚Äôs $1.7 billion acquisition of robot vacuum maker iRobot, with the agency‚Äôs staff attorneys leaning toward suing to stop the deal according to three people with knowledge of that investigation. That case could come in the next few months. It has at least two open privacy investigations, one into Amazon‚Äôs Ring camera and security system business, and the other into its Alexa voice assistant over potential violations of the Children‚Äôs Online Privacy Protection Act, according to four people with knowledge of those cases. The result of at least one of the FTC‚Äôs privacy investigations could come in the next couple of months, one of the people said. FTC staff previously recommended filing a lawsuit over alleged privacy and data security violations at Ring before Khan started. Also potentially coming in the next few months is a wide-ranging antitrust case targeting Amazon‚Äôs retail operations, multiple people with knowledge of the probe said. Though the details of a complaint are not known, it could include the bundling of services through its Prime subscription business and its use of competitor data to out-muscle rival retailers on its platform, according to some of those people. The FTC has been investigating nearly every aspect of the company‚Äôs business since 2019, and a lawsuit has long been expected. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that an antitrust case could be filed against Amazon in the coming months. The FTC is pursuing a so-called ‚Äúdark pattern‚Äù probe into the difficulty customers have unsubscribing from Prime and other services. Dark patterns are deceptive tactics used by websites to trick users into doing things like subscribing to a more expensive service than they intended. It is also conducting a deceptive advertising probe into the ‚ÄúAmazon Choice‚Äù label the company gives certain products on its marketplace. The FTC is investigating how that label is used to promote products that appear in search results, including whether it is pay-to-play. Amazon maintains it is not.

BY JOHN HENDEL Representatives for the FTC and Amazon both declined to comment on the investigations.  The lack of action so far shows the difficulties facing the agency in taking on a company as multifaceted as Amazon ‚Äî and suggests the FTC is picking its cases with caution, according to some of the people, who are familiar with the agency‚Äôs strategy.  The FTC has sued Amazon before, accusing it of illegally withholding tips from some delivery drivers. The company settled the case and paid almost $60 million to reimburse drivers.  Top enforcement officials in the Biden administration have aggressively gone after corporate mergers and tech firms in the past year. The FTC last year sued to block Microsoft‚Äôs $69 billion purchase of Activision, and the Justice Department has two separate lawsuits against Google over its search and advertising businesses in addition to preparing an antitrust case against Apple.  The FTC is also coming off a loss in its case to block Meta‚Äôs acquisition of a popular virtual reality app. While the judge in the case validated the FTC‚Äôs novel theory that it could be illegal for companies to acquire, rather than build, a product, he also said the agency did not have the facts to support its claims.  In that environment, the FTC is under immense pressure to bring a successful antitrust case against Amazon ‚Äî particularly after letting two of the company‚Äôs largest deals through without opposition in the past year, according to agency insiders and observers.  Amazon closed its $8.5 billion purchase of MGM Studios in March 2022, with the agency‚Äôs hands tied as its four commissioners at the time deadlocked along partisan lines on whether to intervene. Then last month, the agency elected to pass on challenging the company‚Äôs $3.9 billion purchase of the primary care provider One Medical despite agency officials‚Äô belief that the deal was anticompetitive, according to three people with knowledge of the agency‚Äôs decision.  The rumble over Roombas  Most of the FTC‚Äôs Amazon investigations were launched during the Trump administration, when Republican chair Joe Simons began a broad oversight push on tech giants.  One exception is the $1.7 billion iRobot deal ‚Äî along with One Medical ‚Äî which was announced in August 2022.  The agency has not yet concluded its investigation of the deal, and is continuing to collect documents and testimony from third parties, five of the people with knowledge of the review said.  FTC staff do not believe that Amazon, the leading online retailer in the U.S., should be allowed to buy the largest maker of a popular product sold on its platform, the people said.  Among its issues, those people said, the agency is concerned that Amazon will favor iRobot‚Äôs Roombas over competing brands of automated vacuums such as Samsung. The FTC is also concerned about how the addition of iRobot will add to the control Amazon has in the broader market for connected home devices. Amazon also owns the home security company Ring, and makes the popular voice assistant Alexa and Echo smart speaker. And the FTC is asking whether Amazon would withhold Roombas from competing retailers altogether.  The FTC has also asked how the deal would increase Amazon‚Äôs control over consumer data, as well as potential privacy harms, but that is not the main focus, according to some of the people.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working cooperatively with the relevant regulators in their review of the merger. We have no plans to operate iRobot differently than how they operate today in regards to its availability through other retailers,‚Äù said Amazon spokesperson Curtis Eichelberger. ‚ÄúWe will continue to supply other retailers and vendors with iRobot products, and continue to sell other products on Amazon.com.‚Äù Amazon also plans to maintain iRobot‚Äôs interoperability with other voice assistants, Eichelberger said.  Amazon has been largely unresponsive to the FTC‚Äôs investigation so far, refusing to turn over information requested by the FTC, some of the people said.  For a targeted company, this can be a strategy to run out the clock: Merger reviews are governed by strict statutory time restrictions. In an in-depth review of a merger, the government has 30 days to decide whether to sue once a company meets all the investigative demands. Companies often agree to give the FTC or Justice Department more time, but Amazon has made no such concession, sources said.  In this case though, the FTC likely has time, given the companies also need approval in the EU and UK before they can close their deal. Those reviews are still in the early stages.

The FTC is currently weighing whether to challenge Amazon‚Äôs $1.7 billion acquisition of robot vacuum maker iRobot, with the agency‚Äôs staff attorneys leaning toward suing to stop the deal according to three people with knowledge of that investigation. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Why the FTC didn‚Äôt try to block the One Medical deal  One reason for FTC‚Äôs lack of action on Amazon so far, say experts, is that it‚Äôs technically very hard to bring cases against tech giants, either for enforcers or private plaintiffs ‚Äî in part because they control all the data that enforcers need to build a case.  ‚ÄúThe platforms have an enormous information advantage and unique access to the evidence that the government or plaintiffs need to meet their burden of proof,‚Äù said Amanda Lewis, in Senate testimony this month. Lewis is a partner with Cuneo, Gilbert and Laduca, and previously worked at the FTC and as a Hill staffer on tech and antitrust issues.  Another illustration of the difficulty is the most recent antitrust case the agency didn‚Äôt pursue against Amazon: Its $3.9 billion purchase of One Medical, a primary care company providing access to doctors through individual and corporate subscriptions.  The FTC extensively investigated the One Medical deal and found evidence of anticompetitive behavior that many at the agency considered damning, but ultimately cleared the deal because they saw it as too hard of a case to win, according to multiple people with knowledge of the agency‚Äôs thinking.  That evidence includes Amazon‚Äôs decision to abruptly end lengthy negotiations to poach some of One Medical‚Äôs corporate customers with cheaper pricing in favor of killing off its competing Amazon Care service and acquiring the company, those people said.  In one instance, Amazon was trying to lure the ride-hailing company Lyft to sign a deal for its own health care service, according to three people with knowledge of Lyft‚Äôs testimony during the merger review. Amazon offered to substantially undercut One Medical on price and offered a national network of doctors ‚Äî but when Lyft was ready to sign with Amazon, the retail giant announced its takeover of One Medical, pulled out of negotiations with Lyft, and then said it was shutting down Amazon Care, the three people said.  A spokesperson for Lyft declined to comment.  Other companies had similar testimony, two of the people said. Though many FTC staffers saw that behavior as anti-competitive and illegal ‚Äî acquiring a competitor rather than competing on the merits ‚Äî the agency ultimately decided it would be too challenging to define exactly what market Amazon was monopolizing, some of the people said.  ‚ÄúWe decided independent of, and prior to, the One Medical acquisition, that the Amazon Care offering and business model wasn‚Äôt going to work long-term,‚Äù Eichelberger said.  For the FTC, time is not on their side. With just 19 months until the election and a potential change in administration, it‚Äôs in the agency‚Äôs interest to move on these cases as quickly as possible, lest priorities change in a new regime.,;,; 2023-03-21 12:50:49]

I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 24th, 2023.  # **Stocks end Friday‚Äôs session little changed, Dow snaps 4-week win streak: Live updates - [(Source)]( ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended little changed Friday and finished lower for the week as investors evaluated the latest earnings results and concerns of disappointing profits. ***** &gt; The 30-stock index added 22.34 points, or 0.07%, to end at 33,808.96, while the S&amp;P 500 eked out a 0.09% gain to settle at 4,133.52. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.11% to close at 12,072.46. ***** &gt; All major indices finished the week in the red, with the Dow falling 0.23% to snap a four-week win streak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq saw the biggest decline, falling 0.42%, while the S&amp;P slipped 0.1%. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the continued push-pull of the fact that the economy has been a lot more resilient than many people expected and corporate earnings have held up pretty well, all things considered,‚Äù said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. ***** &gt; Even so, he noted that the Federal Reserve has raised rates substantially over the last year. Zaccarelli said that even if the central bank hikes as anticipated in May, it will likely hold rates at a higher level than the market expects. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúYou can kind of see the the bull and bear case really right there in a nutshell as far as resilient economy with stronger-than-expected corporate earnings versus a very hot, very restrictive monetary policy coming from the Fed,‚Äù he said. ***** &gt; Earnings season continued Friday, with results from Procter &amp; Gamble. The consumer products company gained 3.5% after beating expectations and lifting it sales forecast. As of Friday morning, 76% of S&amp;P 500 companies reporting earnings so far have beaten analyst EPS estimates, according to FactSet. ***** &gt; Elsewhere, materials stocks were the worst performers, with Freeport-McMoRan falling 4.1%. Albemarle tumbled 10% as Chile said it would nationalize its lithium industry. ***** &gt; While companies broadly beat expectations this week, overall profit reports failed to boost stocks, with some investors fearing an earnings drop looms with a likely recession ahead. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúSo far, earnings season is off to an uneventful start, with many companies meeting already reduced earnings expectations and that helps to explain the lack of movement in the major stock indices over the past few days,‚Äù said Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, adding that she expects stocks to trade in a tight range for some time. ***** &gt; Earnings continue next week with results on deck from Big Tech companies Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and Microsoft.  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](   *****  &gt; # Lithium: The Cycle Continues  &gt; If you haven't checked the price of lithium lately, you might be in for a surprise. Spot prices for lithium carbonate in China have collapsed by two-thirds since hitting record highs in November of last year. Prices have gone from $84k per ton to $25k per ton. That unwinds the vast majority of a spectacular surge that played out from 2020 to 2022. Lithium initially surged 1,279% from July 2020 to March 2022 as part of the broader explosion of commodity prices and booming demand for electric vehicles, eventually peaking up 1,387% from the post-COVID lows. It's easy to forget that this critical battery input had already gone through one such cycle. A 224% rally in 6 months during late 2015 and early 2016 before a long, slow bear market that saw prices down 78% over several years.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; In the equity market, the price cycle hasn't been as dramatic in percentage terms, but there has still nonetheless been a double cycle of surging stock prices in 2016 followed by a grinding bear market, and then an even more dramatic surge through late 2022 that is now sliding into reverse. On Thursday, Chile's government announced reforms to its lithium extraction policy. While existing contracts with firms that operate in the rich lithium brine deposits of the Chilean Atacama desert will be honored, the market is looking at weaker lithium prices and the fact that existing contracts will be replaced by less favorable ones 10+ years down the line and hitting lithium players. SQM is off 21% today while ALB is 10% lower.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # April 2nd Half Strength After Tax Deadline  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; 1st half of April used to outperform the second half, but since 1994 that has not been the case. Traders are more focused on Q1 earnings and guidance during April than the Tax Deadline nowadays.  &gt; Expectations are low for earnings season and next week is a big week with 35% of S&amp;P 500 stocks reporting next week including AMZN, GOOGL, META &amp; MSFT, compared to less than 12% this week and 2% last week (Hat tip @ScottSchnipper @CNBC @CNBCPro). Better than expected results and upbeat guidance could rally stocks into month-end.  &gt; These 2 charts show how April is tracking usual performance over the last 21 years as well as during pre-election years. April is clearly weaker than normal, yet the market is still tracking the directional trends.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](    *****  &gt; # Jobless Claims Nearing New Highs  &gt; Jobless claims have continued to weaken with this week's release, rising by 5K to 245K versus expectations of no change from last week's upwardly revised 240K print. At current levels, claims sit at the high end of the range since the start of 2022 and only a couple thousand below last month's high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Prior to seasonal adjustment, claims have essentially come in right inline with the reading for the same week last year and the few years prior to the pandemic. As shown in the second chart below, claims tend to experience a little bit of a bounce around this point of the year before resuming a move lower through the late spring.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Continuing claims were equally disappointing this week rising to 1.865 million, 40K above expectations. Although the increase to initial claims has not resulted in a new high, the 61K increase for continuing claims leaves the indicator at the highest level since late November 2021.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Homebuilders Breaking Out Like It's...  &gt; It's hard to get over how well the homebuilder stocks have been performing lately. As shown in the charts below of stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 Homebuilder group, these names are nearly universally in steep six-month uptrends and breaking out as we type.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]( &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Below is another way to see just how crazy the run has been for the S&amp;P 1500 Homebuilder stocks lately. Most names are now up 30-40% year-to-date after rallying 5-10% over the last week. This has pushed them ~10% above their 50-DMAs, and many are trading more than two (or even three for some) standard deviations above their 50-DMAs in extreme overbought territory.  &gt; "Mr. Market" has either lost its mind or it's predicting that all the current worries about housing in the months and quarters ahead are misguided.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Sell in May and go away ‚Äì Maybe, it depends  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; In the above table the ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù performance of DJIA, S&amp;P 500, and NASDAQ have been separated by year of the four-year-presidential-election cycle going back to 1951 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 and 1971 for NASDAQ. NASDAQ‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù are July through October compared to May to October for DJIA and S&amp;P 500. Even though pre-election years have historically been the best performing year of the four-year cycle, performance during the ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù has not been the least bit impressive. In 18 pre-election year ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù periods, DJIA has averaged a meager 1.14%. S&amp;P 500 is only slightly better +1.81% while NASDAQ‚Äôs average is under 1%. Frequency of gains or percentage of time higher in pre-election years ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù is only slightly better than 50-50.  &gt; Because of the elevated level of risk that has been historically observed during the ‚ÄúWorst Six Months‚Äù of the year and its historically tepid returns, reducing long exposure and developing a defensive strategy is the approach taken in the Almanac Investor Stock and ETF Portfolios. We do not merely ‚Äúsell in May and go away.‚Äù Instead, we take some profits, trim or outright sell underperforming stock and ETF positions, tighten stop losses and limit adding new long exposure to positions from sectors that have a demonstrated a record of outperforming during the ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù period.  &gt; For those with a lower risk tolerance or a desire to take a break from trading, the ‚ÄúWorst Months‚Äù are a great opportunity to unwind some longs and move into the relative safety of cash, Treasury bonds, gold and/or some combination of traditional defensive assets. For the first time in over a decade, cash can currently earn something other than zero. Preservation of capital may be more important than growth and with historical averages and frequency of gains reduced; the ‚ÄúWorst Six Months‚Äù are a good time to simply step aside if you prefer. August, September and/or October have provided some excellent buying opportunities over the years and could do the same again this year.  *****  &gt; # Sector Breadth All Over the Place  &gt; In terms of price, the Industrials sector remains 5.75% below its high from January of last year and has yet to even take out the highs from earlier this year, but breadth has been more constructive recently. Just yesterday, the cumulative advance/decline line hit a new all time high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Although that measure of breadth is making promising moves, other breadth measures have not exactly echoed that strength. In spite of the record high in the cumulative A/D line Monday, only 37% of the sector's stocks finished above their 50-DMAs. As shown below, of all other instances of a record high in the cumulative AD line, there has never been such a low reading in the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs. In fact, no other readings have even crossed into the 30% range! For the vast majority of previous highs, the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs has sat at 70% or more.   &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; All that is to say that most Industrials sector stocks are moving higher, but have not yet moved above potential resistance at their 50-DMAs. And even though the reading on the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs is low at the moment, that is not to say it is not improving rapidly. As shown below, it has risen sharply from the low of 19.18% on April 6th. Furthermore, whereas Monday's close only saw 37% of the sector finish above their 50-DMAs, as of mid-morning Tuesday the reading is already up another 8.2 percentage points to 45.2% as the average stock in the sector trades just 7 bps below its 50-DMA.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Volatility Is The Toll We Pay  &gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a proprietary strategy. I can‚Äôt go into it in great detail.‚Äù ‚Äì Bernie Madoff  &gt; Although Bernie Madoff was quite vague when asked how he had a strategy that printed money month after month when no one else could match it, as investors we know one thing and that is markets don‚Äôt always go straight up.  &gt; Burt White, our Managing Director and Chief Strategy Officer, likes to say that volatility is the toll we pay to invest. No one wants to pay a toll, but sometimes you just have to do it to get where you are going. When I lived in Charlotte and would drive back up to Ohio for holidays, I‚Äôd have to pay the great state of West Virginia $4.25 three different times on I-77. I didn‚Äôt like it, but Santa brought the kids presents up there and I had to do it.  &gt; Getting back to the stock market, volatility is that toll that we pay for enjoying longer-term returns. Below is a great chart that sums it up and thanks to our friends at Ned Davis Research for helping us with the data.  &gt; Here‚Äôs what you need to know regarding the S&amp;P 500:  &gt; Each year sees more than seven different 3% percent dips. More than three times a year do stocks correct 5%. About once a year on average sees a 10% correction. A 15% major correction happens every year-and-a-half. A 20% bear markets happens about every three years.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Another quote I like is from Regis Philbin when he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm involved in the stock market, which is fun, but sometimes very painful.‚Äù Well, this year has been fun for investors, but last year was quite painful.  &gt; After more than a 120% rally off the March 2020 lows, maybe the bear market we saw last year shouldn‚Äôt have caught as many investors off guard like it did? We didn‚Äôt quite see a 25% bear market happening last year, but we expected as much as a 15% correction at some point. With the historically aggressive Fed, inflation soaring, China lockdowns, the war, and supply chains in disarray, it was a perfect cocktail for a bear market.  &gt; The truth though is we get spoiled by the good times and when the rough times hit, we are almost surprised that bad times ever happen. Well, they do happen and it is all part of investing, or the toll we pay to invest. Just know this, volatility and bear markets have happened before and will happen again. The good new though is after this bad times, likely better times will be coming!  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending April 21st, 2023**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 4/23/23**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; (*$AMZN $MSFT $META $FRC $KO $BA $VZ $GOOGL $UPS $ENPH $CLF $HAL $MCD $GM $GE $MMM $PEP $XOM $SPOT $INTC $AAL $V $ROKU $RTX $NEE $PHG $CAT $CVX $SNAP $LLY $VLO $LUV $BOH $MA $CROX $SIFY $JBLU $CMG $DOW $MO $ABBV $NOW $DHR $DX $NET $HUM $HLT $MRK $BMRC $PACW*)  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  &gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).  &gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  # DISCUSS!

S&amp;P 500 futures were down 0.2%, while Nasdaq-100 futures traded up 0.3%. ***** &gt; Credit Suisse announced overnight it will borrow up to nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank to assure short-term liquidity.

U.S.-listed shares gained 5% in extended trading after falling just under 14% in the prior session. ***** &gt; But the news was not enough to quell fears on Wall Street of an impending crisis, leading regional banks to take another leg down in Thursday‚Äôs premarket. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) slid 2.6% in extended trading, led down by a more than 26% drop in First Republic Bank. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs also similar to ‚Äô08 is the hunting in the market for who‚Äôs the most weak next,‚Äù said Greg Fleming, CEO of Rockefeller Capital Management and former president of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd the proxy‚Äôs been uninsured deposits.‚Äù ***** &gt; Growing concern over Credit Suisse sent other European banking stocks lower and reverberated in U.S. markets beginning Wednesday. The Dow at one point Wednesday fell 725 points before ending the day down by 280.83 points, or 0.87% lower. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.7%. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no doubt changing the landscape of how we as investors look at the investability of financial institutions that fit in the banking sector,‚Äù said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. ‚ÄúIt also makes us ponder just how the sector would navigate with, in the future, more forms of regulatory pressure on these corporations.‚Äù ***** &gt; Traders will keep an eye out for key economic data, including the latest jobless claims report.

[Federal Officials Trade Stock in Companies Their Agencies Oversee,;,;   Hidden records show thousands of senior executive branch employees owned shares of companies whose fates were directly affected by their employers‚Äô actions, a Wall Street Journal investigation found  Thousands of officials across the government‚Äôs executive branch reported owning or trading stocks that stood to rise or fall with decisions their agencies made, a Wall Street Journal investigation has found.  More than 2,600 officials at agencies from the Commerce Department to the Treasury Department, during both Republican and Democratic administrations, disclosed stock investments in companies while those same companies were lobbying their agencies for favorable policies. That amounts to more than one in five senior federal employees across 50 federal agencies reviewed by the Journal.  A top official at the Environmental Protection Agency reported purchases of oil and gas stocks. The Food and Drug Administration improperly let an official own dozens of food and drug stocks on its no-buy list. A Defense Department official bought stock in a defense company five times before it won new business from the Pentagon.  The Journal obtained and analyzed more than 31,000 financial-disclosure forms for about 12,000 senior career employees, political staff and presidential appointees. The review spans 2016 through 2021 and includes data on about 850,000 financial assets and more than 315,000 trades reported in stocks, bonds and funds by the officials, their spouses or dependent children.  The vast majority of the disclosure forms aren‚Äôt available online or readily accessible. The review amounts to the most comprehensive analysis of investments held by executive-branch officials, who have wide but largely unseen influence over public policy.   Among the Journal‚Äôs findings:  ‚Ä¢ While the government was ramping up scrutiny of big technology companies, more than 1,800 federal officials reported owning or trading at least one of four major tech stocks: Meta Platforms Inc.‚Äôs Facebook, Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.  ‚Ä¢ More than five dozen officials at five agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, reported trading stock in companies shortly before their departments announced enforcement actions, such as charges and settlements, against those companies.  ‚Ä¢ More than 200 senior EPA officials, nearly one in three, reported investments in companies that were lobbying the agency. EPA employees and their family members collectively owned between $400,000 and nearly $2 million in shares of oil and gas companies on average each year between 2016 and 2021.  ‚Ä¢ At the Defense Department, officials in the office of the secretary reported collectively owning between $1.2 million and $3.4 million of stock in aerospace and defense companies on average each year examined by the Journal. Some held stock in Chinese companies while the U.S. was considering blacklisting the companies.  ‚Ä¢ About 70 federal officials reported using riskier financial techniques such as short selling and options trading, with some individual trades valued at between $5 million and $25 million. In all, the forms revealed more than 90,000 trades of stocks during the six-year period reviewed.  ‚Ä¢ When financial holdings caused a conflict, the agencies sometimes simply waived the rules. In most instances identified by the Journal, ethics officials certified that the employees had complied with the rules, which have several exemptions that allow officials to hold stock that conflicts with their agency‚Äôs work. Number of federal officials who reported owning specific tech stocks, 2016-21  Federal agency officials, many of them unknown to the public, wield ‚Äúimmense power and influence over things that impact the day-to-day lives of everyday Americans, such as public health and food safety, diplomatic relations and regulating trade,‚Äù said Don Fox, an ethics lawyer and former general counsel at the U.S. agency that oversees conflict-of-interest rules.  He said many of the examples in the Journal analysis ‚Äúclearly violate the spirit behind the law, which is to maintain the public‚Äôs confidence in the integrity of the government.‚Äù  Some federal officials use investment advisers who direct their stock trading, but such trades still can create conflicts under the law. ‚ÄúThe buck stops with the official,‚Äù said Kathleen Clark, a law professor and former ethics lawyer for the Washington, D.C., government. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the official who could benefit or be harmed‚Ä¶. That can occur regardless of who made the trade.‚Äù  Investing by federal agency officials has drawn far less public attention than that of lawmakers. Congress has long faced criticism for not prohibiting lawmakers from working on matters in which they have a financial interest. The rules were tightened in 2012 by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, passed following a series of Journal articles on congressional trading abuses.  Journal reporting last year on federal judges, revealing that more than 130 jurists heard cases in which they had a financial interest, led to a law passed this May requiring judges to promptly post online any stock trades they make.  This article launches a Journal series on the financial holdings of senior executive-branch employees and, in some instances, conflicts of interest hidden in their disclosure forms.  U.S. law prohibits federal officials from working on any matters that could affect their personal finances. Additional regulations adopted in 1992 direct federal employees to avoid even an appearance of a conflict of interest.  The 1978 Ethics in Government Act requires senior federal employees above a certain pay level to file annual financial disclosures listing their income, assets and loans. The financial figures are reported in broad dollar ranges. image A view of Washington, D.C.  Most officials‚Äô financial disclosures are public only upon request. The Journal obtained disclosure forms by filing written requests with each federal agency.  Some made it difficult to obtain the forms, and several agencies haven‚Äôt turned over all of them. The Department of Homeland Security hasn‚Äôt provided any financial records. (See an accompanying article on methodology.)  Under federal regulations, investments of $15,000 or less in individual stocks aren‚Äôt considered potential conflicts, nor are holdings of $50,000 or less in mutual funds that focus on a specific industry. The law doesn‚Äôt restrict investing in diversified funds.  Some federal officials, especially those at the most senior levels, sell all their individual stocks when they enter the government to avoid the appearance of a conflict.  The Office of Government Ethics, which oversees the conflict-of-interest rules across the executive branch, is ‚Äúcommitted to transparency and citizen oversight of government,‚Äù said a spokeswoman. She said the agency publishes financial disclosures of the most senior officials on its website, along with instructions for getting disclosures from other agencies.  At the EPA, an official named Michael Molina and his husband owned oil and gas stocks while Mr. Molina was serving as senior adviser to the deputy EPA administrator, according to agency records. Such companies stood to benefit from former President Donald Trump‚Äôs pledge to promote energy production by rolling back environmental regulations and speeding up projects.  Mr. Molina‚Äôs job gave him a front-row seat to deliberations about environmental regulations relating to energy. He ‚Äúreviews and coordinates sensitive reports, documents and other materials,‚Äù said his job description, provided by the EPA in response to a public-records request. He served as a ‚Äúpersonal and confidential representative‚Äù of the EPA deputy administrator in communications with the White House and Congress, according to the job description.  In the month he started the job, May 2018, Mr. Molina reported purchases totaling between $16,002 and $65,000 of stock in Cheniere Energy Inc., a leading producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas. He reported adding Cheniere stock five additional times over the next year. At the time, senior EPA officials were encouraging the production of natural gas in the U.S.  Reported trades in energy and mining firms;  made by spouse through a financial adviser  The trades were made through a financial adviser in his husband‚Äôs account, according to emails and disclosure forms reviewed by the Journal. Mr. Molina was required to enter the trades into the EPA‚Äôs electronic-disclosure system within 30 days of receiving notice of the transactions, under the 2012 STOCK Act.  Officials are responsible for ensuring that their holdings don‚Äôt conflict with their work, regardless of whether they use a financial adviser. The Journal‚Äôs review of disclosures shows that many federal officials tell their financial advisers to avoid investing in certain industries or to shed specific stocks.  In an interview on Sept. 28, Mr. Molina indicated that he didn‚Äôt know much about the energy trades. ‚ÄúI can say this on the record: I didn‚Äôt even know what Cheniere was until 36 hours ago,‚Äù he said.  In February 2019, Mr. Molina was promoted to EPA deputy chief of staff. He attended scores of meetings on environmental issues, reviewed matters for the then-head of the agency, Andrew Wheeler, and was sometimes asked his opinions in meetings, according to records reviewed by the Journal and people familiar with the matter.  In about 2¬Ω years at the EPA, Mr. Molina reported more than 100 trades in energy and mining companies including Duke Energy Corp., NextEra Energy Inc. and BP PLC. About 20 of the transactions were for between $15,001 and $50,000 each, according to Mr. Molina‚Äôs disclosures. Those trades also were made for his husband by his financial adviser.  In the month he was promoted, February 2019, his husband made several stock purchases through the adviser in Cheniere and Williams Cos., which builds and operates natural-gas pipelines.  Two months later, Mr. Trump said the EPA would propose new rules to help the gas industry.  After publication of this article, Mr. Molina said in a written statement: ‚ÄúNeither I nor my husband knew about or directed any of these trades. Our financial advisor had complete discretion to trade in the account, and these same trades were made on behalf of a ‚Äòpool‚Äô of several dozen clients‚Äînot for us individually.‚Äù  Mr. Molina left the EPA in January 2021. An EPA spokeswoman said the agency‚Äôs ethics office ‚Äúcounseled Mr. Molina on his ethics and financial disclosure obligations.‚Äù EPA officials signed Mr. Molina‚Äôs financial-disclosure statement in each year he worked at the agency, an indication they believed he was in compliance with the conflict-of-interest rules.  U.S. law leaves it to individual agencies to decide whether they need rules to beef up the federal conflict-of-interest law. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission explicitly bars its officials from investing in natural gas, interstate oil pipeline, utility and other energy firms.  The EPA doesn‚Äôt have additional agencywide rules. A spokeswoman for the EPA said its officials may invest in energy companies so long as they aren‚Äôt working on policies that could affect their investments. Mr. Molina‚Äôs boss told ethics officials that he had no influence over public policy matters.  Greg Zacharias was the chief scientist for the Defense Department‚Äôs director of operational test and evaluation until last fall. He repeatedly bought stock in a defense contractor in the weeks before the Pentagon announced it would pay the company $1 billion to deliver more F-35 combat jets, while his division was overseeing testing of those planes.  Mr. Zacharias made five purchases of Lockheed Martin Corp. stock, collectively worth $20,700, in August and September 2021, according to figures he provided. On Sept. 24, 2021, the Defense Department said it was buying 16 F-35 jets from Lockheed for the Air Force and Marine Corps. Lockheed shares closed up 1.1% the next trading day. The stock made up a small part of Mr. Zacharias‚Äôs portfolio.  Mr. Zacharias‚Äôs office had been involved for years in overseeing testing of combat jets, and testing officials regularly met with the Pentagon‚Äôs F-35 Joint Program Office and with Lockheed directly, according to former defense officials. Mr. Zacharias, who provided scientific and technical expertise on how to assess the effectiveness of weapons systems, didn‚Äôt attend those meetings.  In an interview, Mr. Zacharias said he wasn‚Äôt involved in decisions on contracting and had no inside knowledge ahead of the contract, beyond the public information that the Pentagon remained committed to the F-35 program. He acknowledged that his role could have allowed him to access information about specific weapons systems. ‚ÄúI could always walk downstairs and ask them how it‚Äôs going. But that really wasn‚Äôt an interest of mine,‚Äù he said, adding that his focus was emerging technologies.  Mr. Zacharias said he wanted to buy stock in defense contractors, including Lockheed, because of their dominance of the defense market. He said he didn‚Äôt pay much attention to the timing of trades, adding: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just the pipe-smoking science guy.‚Äù  The Lockheed investments were among more than 50 trades Mr. Zacharias reported in about a half-dozen defense contractors in 2020 and 2021, according to the Journal‚Äôs analysis.  ‚ÄúI apologize that things don‚Äôt look good on the buy side,‚Äù Mr. Zacharias added. Of the trades in defense contractors, he said: ‚ÄúI just decided that would be a good investment at the time.‚Äù  He said ethics officials didn‚Äôt raise concerns about his trades in Lockheed or any of the other defense contractors he reported investments in, beyond periodically sending a letter reminding him not to take part in contract negotiations involving the companies. He said ethics rules could be ‚Äúa little tighter.‚Äù  A Pentagon spokeswoman said Mr. Zacharias ‚Äúworked with his supervisor and ethics officials to implement appropriate disqualifications.‚Äù She said the department requires supervisors to screen their employees‚Äô disclosures for conflicts in addition to the review conducted by ethics officials. Ethics officials certified that he complied with the law.  Some conflicts of interest stemmed from agencies‚Äô misunderstanding of their own rules.  The FDA prohibits employees, their spouses and their minor children from investing in companies that are ‚Äúsignificantly regulated‚Äù by the agency. The FDA maintains an online list of the prohibited companies for officials to check.  An FDA official named Malcolm Bertoni disclosed that he and his wife owned stock in about 70 pharmaceutical, diagnostics, medical device and food companies regulated by the agency in 2018 and 2019, including drug giants Pfizer Inc. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. All were on the prohibited list.  Mr. Bertoni, a career executive, ran the FDA‚Äôs planning office from 2008 to 2019, researching and analyzing agency programs. Most of the investments he reported were in the range of $1,001 to $15,000, but his 2019 disclosure showed he and his wife owned between $15,001 and $50,000 in each of Allergan PLC, Sanofi SA, Takeda and Zoetis Inc.  Mr. Bertoni‚Äôs lawyer, Charles Borden, said Mr. Bertoni and his wife held these stocks despite the bans because they got bad advice from the FDA ethics office.  The stocks were in accounts managed by professionals who had discretion to trade without the knowledge of Mr. Bertoni or his wife, the attorney said. He said that years ago, Mr. Bertoni asked the ethics office how he should treat the accounts and was told they fell into an exception to the rules for mutual funds.  They did not. The ethics office discovered its error in a routine review of Mr. Bertoni‚Äôs forms in early 2019, Mr. Borden said. ‚ÄúThe FDA‚Äôs Office of Ethics and Integrity took full responsibility for the inaccurate guidance given to Mr. Bertoni,‚Äù the attorney said in an email.  After considering the tax and retirement-planning consequences of having to sell the stocks, and other personal factors, Mr. Bertoni chose to retire instead, his lawyer said.  An FDA spokesman said Mr. Bertoni was recused from matters involving the companies once he reported his family‚Äôs holdings in them. The spokesman declined to comment on the events leading up to his departure.  ‚ÄúThe FDA takes seriously its obligation to help ensure that decisions made, and actions taken, by the agency and its employees, are not, nor appear to be, tainted by any question of conflict of interest,‚Äù said the spokesman.  When federal officials are found to have violated conflicts rules and are referred to criminal authorities, they often receive light punishment if any, according to records reviewed by the Journal.  Valerie Hardy-Mahoney, a lawyer who runs the National Labor Relations Board‚Äôs Oakland, Calif.-based regional office, held Tesla Inc. shares as her office pursued complaints against the auto maker and Chief Executive Elon Musk and considered whether to file more.  Members of the labor relations board, appointed by the president, review decisions made by agency administrative courts. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney acts as a prosecutor in those courts. She is a career employee who joined the NLRB in the 1980s.  Ms. Hardy-Mahoney‚Äôs office filed complaints against Tesla in 2017 and 2018. She reported holding Tesla shares worth $1,001 to $15,000 in 2019 while those cases were ongoing. The next year, her disclosure form shows, she owned Tesla shares valued at between $30,002 and $100,000 in E*Trade accounts. She purchased two chunks of Tesla stock in August 2020, each valued at between $1,001 and $15,000, according to her disclosure form.  The NLRB ruled in March 2021 that Tesla had illegally fired an employee involved in union organizing and that Mr. Musk, in a tweet, had coerced employees by threatening them with the loss of stock options if they unionized. It ordered Tesla to reinstate the employee and Mr. Musk to delete the tweet. Tesla has disputed the findings and has appealed the decision to a federal appeals court.  Ms. Hardy-Mahoney‚Äôs office has in other cases rejected charges against Tesla filed by employees, including allegations her office received in 2020, after she bought more Tesla stock, according to an NLRB case docket. An employee who worked at the Tesla Gigafactory alleged that the company interfered with workers‚Äô rights. Ms. Hardy-Mahoney‚Äôs office dismissed the charge in January 2021.  Last November, an NLRB ethics official declined to certify that Ms. Hardy-Mahoney was in compliance with ethics laws and regulations, according to her disclosure form.  The NLRB‚Äôs inspector general said in a report that his office had substantiated an allegation of violating federal law by participating in a matter in which an employee had a financial interest. An agency spokeswoman confirmed that the report involved Ms. Hardy-Mahoney.  The report said that the matter was referred to the local U.S. attorney‚Äôs office, but that federal prosecutors declined to take it. The report said the subject of the report‚ÄîMs. Hardy-Mahoney‚Äîreceived additional training regarding financial conflicts of interest and the case was closed.  Ms. Hardy-Mahoney declined to comment. She recused herself from Tesla cases last year and now is in compliance with conflict-of-interest rules, the NLRB spokeswoman said.  At the Federal Reserve, an economist named Min Wei reported trades in stock of a marijuana company after the Fed sought clarity about whether banks could serve cannabis businesses. A Fed spokeswoman said the trades were made by Ms. Wei‚Äôs husband.  In June 2018, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said publicly that the issue put the central bank ‚Äúin a very, very difficult position.‚Äù Even though its mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, Mr. Powell said, he ‚Äújust would love to see‚Äù a clear policy on the matter.  Because Mr. Powell didn‚Äôt dismiss the idea, investors saw the comment as bullish for cannabis companies such as Tilray Brands Inc., a leading producer. Tilray went public the following month, and its stock skyrocketed.  In early September 2018, Ms. Wei‚Äôs husband bought between $480,005 and $1.1 million of Tilray shares, according to her disclosure form and the Fed. The stock continued to surge.  It then became clear that neither the Fed nor the Treasury would take action; it would be up to Congress, with no quick fix in sight. In October, shares of cannabis companies began to fall.  Ms. Wei‚Äôs husband sold his Tilray stake in five sales in early October. By then, the shares had nearly doubled, worth between $800,005 and $1.75 million, according to Ms. Wei‚Äôs disclosure.  The Fed imposed new restrictions this year on investing by bank presidents, Fed board governors and senior staff after the Journal reported questionable trading by presidents of two Fed banks, who subsequently resigned. The new rules prohibit trading individual stocks and bonds and require that trades, even in mutual funds, be preapproved and prescheduled.  The new Fed rules for top people don‚Äôt apply to Ms. Wei because she isn‚Äôt senior enough. The trades were ‚Äúpermissible then and are permissible now,‚Äù said the Fed spokeswoman.  Ms. Wei referred questions to the Fed. The spokeswoman said Ms. Wei had ‚Äúno responsibility or involvement with policy decisions related to bank supervision or the provision of banking services.‚Äù She said the Fed ‚Äúdid not assert any interest at the time in the Federal Reserve resolving the conflict between federal and state law in the area of cannabis companies and their access to banking services, but rather pointed out that the appropriate resolution of those issues should come from the Congress.‚Äù  Ethics lawyers said trading such large amounts of an individual stock while the Fed is publicly addressing an issue creates an appearance problem, even if Ms. Wei‚Äôs trades didn‚Äôt violate conflicts rules. image The Federal Reserve building in Washington.  Roughly seven dozen federal officials reported more than 500 financial transactions apiece over the six-year period analyzed by the Journal. Some traded a single stock frequently, while others reported hundreds or even thousands of trades across a broad array of stocks, bonds and funds.  In one instance, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission permitted short sales contrary to one of the CFTC‚Äôs own rules.  The financial disclosure of Lihong McPhail, an economist at the CFTC, showed the most trading reported by any federal official in the Journal‚Äôs review. Her husband made more than 9,500 trades in 2020‚Äîan average of about 38 each trading day, according to her disclosure form and the CFTC.  About one-third of those reported 2020 trades‚Äî2,994‚Äîinvolved shorting stocks, or betting on a fall in their price. They ranged from Amazon to Ford Motor Co. to Zoom Video Communications Inc. The CFTC said all the short sales were made by her husband.  Over the years, to safeguard the CFTC‚Äôs integrity, Congress imposed tighter restrictions than at other agencies on employees‚Äô investing. In amending the Commodity Exchange Act, Congress also declared that any breach by a CFTC employee of an investment rule set by the commission could be punishable by up to a $500,000 fine and five years in prison. The CFTC‚Äôs role doesn‚Äôt include regulating stocks, but in 2002, the agency adopted a rule banning short selling by its employees and their families.  Nonetheless, a CFTC ethics official approved short selling by Ms. McPhail‚Äôs husband, Joseph McPhail, a CFTC spokesman said, fearing that the commission ‚Äúcould possibly be sued by the employee if we said no.‚Äù The spokesman said the ethics office believed the regulatory provision exceeded the commission‚Äôs statutory authority.  Mr. McPhail referred questions to the CFTC. The CFTC spokesman said he didn‚Äôt speak for the McPhails. Ms. McPhail didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment.  At the CFTC, ‚Äúemployees are required by statute and by regulations to adhere to strict ethical standards and to disclose personal investments to ensure that the work of the CFTC to oversee markets is free from any conflict of interest,‚Äù said the agency spokesman. ‚ÄúIn this instance, several years ago the employee sought advice regarding their spouse‚Äôs investments and received approval from career ethics counsel.‚Äù  Mr. McPhail was a senior policy analyst at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. until September 2021. In a written statement, that agency said: ‚ÄúThe FDIC expects our employees, as public servants, to devote their time and efforts to our mission to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation‚Äôs banking system.‚Äù  The Defense Department was among the federal agencies with the most officials who invested in Chinese stocks, even as the Pentagon in recent years has shifted its focus to countering China.  Across the federal government, more than 400 officials owned or traded Chinese company stocks, including officials at the State Department and White House, the Journal found. Their investments amounted to between $1.9 million and $6.6 million on average a year.  Reed Werner, while serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense for south and southeast Asia, in December 2020 reported a purchase of between $15,001 and $50,000 of stock in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  At the time, discussions were under way at the Pentagon over whether to add the Chinese e-commerce giant to a list of companies in which Americans were barred from investing because of their alleged ties to the Chinese government.  Defense and State officials pushed to add the company to the blacklist, while the Treasury feared this would have wide capital-markets ramifications. Mr. Werner had been involved over a period of months in some discussions about what companies to add to the blacklist, former defense officials said.  Nearly two weeks after the Alibaba purchase, the Treasury updated its list and didn‚Äôt include Alibaba. The company‚Äôs stock rose 4% that day.  Three days later, Mr. Werner‚Äôs financial-disclosure form shows a sale of between $15,001 and $50,000 of Alibaba stock.  The sale came a day before a meeting where defense officials planned to press their case for adding Alibaba and two other companies to the blacklist. Then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ultimately blocked the effort.  In an interview, Mr. Werner acknowledged he was involved in discussions about adding Alibaba to the list, saying he attended a meeting in late 2020 and was on an email chain about the matter. He said that he wasn‚Äôt involved in blacklist discussions during the period the Alibaba trades were made, and that the trades resulted in a $1,556.51 gain. He declined to answer further questions.  The Pentagon spokeswoman said that the officials who formally compiled and approved the blacklist didn‚Äôt own stock in affected companies, and that supervisors and ethics officials review reports for holdings that could conflict with an employee‚Äôs duties. Ethics officials certified that Mr. Werner complied with the law.  At least 15 other defense officials in the office of the secretary reported that they or family members owned or traded Alibaba between 2016 and 2021, including Jack Wilmer, who served as senior cybersecurity adviser at the White House and then as the Pentagon‚Äôs top cybersecurity official.  Between 2018 and 2020, Mr. Wilmer reported at least six trades, which he said totaled around $10,000, in the Chinese companies Alibaba, search-engine giant Baidu Inc. and China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp.  Mr. Wilmer said that a money manager handles his trades and that he didn‚Äôt direct any of those transactions. He said he wasn‚Äôt involved in policy-making decisions that would have affected those stocks and said he didn‚Äôt see a conflict between his job and investments. He left the government in July 2020, before Mr. Trump signed the executive order barring Americans from investing in certain Chinese companies.  Within federal agencies, ethics officials generally don‚Äôt consider it their job to investigate whether employees are making stock trades based on information they glean from their government jobs. Ethics officials‚Äô ability to spot potential conflicts is limited because they usually don‚Äôt know what employees are working on.  When ethics officials do see a potential violation, they can refer it to their agencies‚Äô inspectors general, who refer cases on to the Justice Department if they find evidence of wrongdoing.  A Journal review of inspector general reports showed that the offices rarely investigated financial conflicts. As more federal officials invest in the stock market, ethics officials say they have less time to look into possible wrongdoing. When findings have been referred to the Justice Department, prosecutors in most cases have declined to open an investigation.  One matter at the Securities and Exchange Commission involved an official who failed to report or clear his and his spouse‚Äôs financial holdings and trades for at least seven years. The trades included stocks that SEC employees and their families weren‚Äôt allowed to own, some of which the SEC inspector general determined posed a conflict with the official‚Äôs work, according to a report the inspector general provided to Congress.  When a U.S. attorney declined to prosecute, the SEC‚Äôs inspector general reported the findings to SEC management. The unnamed official ultimately was suspended for seven days and gave up 16 hours of leave time.  The SEC declined to comment. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on individual investigations but said: ‚ÄúWe take all inspector general referrals seriously and bring charges when the facts and law support them, consistent with the principles of federal prosecution.‚Äù Share Your Thoughts  Are stock trading rules for federal officials OK or should they be further restricted? Join the conversation below.  Most federal agencies don‚Äôt have protocols to verify that officials‚Äô financial disclosures are complete. One Agriculture Department official disclosed wheat, corn and soybean futures and options trades. The Journal discovered that he had made additional large trades in corn and soybean futures in 2018 and 2019 and omitted them from his reports.  The official, Clare Carlson, who is no longer at the USDA, said that he tried to be scrupulous in his disclosures, and that the omissions were honest mistakes. The Agriculture Department declined to comment.  At the EPA, Mr. Molina‚Äôs financial-disclosure reporting caught the attention of ethics officials.  The conflict-of-interest rules say executive-branch employees may not ‚Äúparticipate personally and substantially‚Äù in matters that have a ‚Äúdirect and predictable effect‚Äù on their investments and those of family members.  When the ethics officials contacted Mr. Molina about energy stocks he reported on his forms, they were told he didn‚Äôt have any influence over environmental policy.  His ‚Äúduties are administrative in nature,‚Äù his boss, the EPA‚Äôs chief of staff at the time, told the ethics officials. ‚ÄúHe provides logistical support to the principal but does not participate personally and substantially in making any decisions, recommendations or advice that will have any direct or substantial effect‚Äù on his financial interests, the chief of staff said, according to Mr. Molina‚Äôs financial disclosure.  In his time at the EPA, Mr. Molina clashed with ethics officials. Many of his financial disclosure reports were inaccurate and tardy, according to EPA emails reviewed by the Journal. At one point, he didn‚Äôt file accurate monthly trading disclosures for 12 months, according to the EPA emails. Mr. Molina reported the stock trades on his annual financial reports, as required.  Ethics officials said they contacted Mr. Molina ‚Äúscores‚Äù of times to press him to file timely reports, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.  In one email, a senior ethics official said his office had ‚Äúprovided you with at least 3-5 times more personal assistance than for any other agency employee, yet the required ethics reports were still late.‚Äù  Mr. Molina told EPA officials that he initially didn‚Äôt know he was supposed to complete regular stock-trading reports. He later struggled to keep up with the EPA‚Äôs electronic-disclosure system, according to the emails reviewed by the Journal.  In September 2020, the EPA fined Mr. Molina $3,200 for numerous failures to disclose stock trades to the agency on time. Mr. Molina refused to pay.  ‚ÄúWe have never before had an employee refuse to pay the late fee,‚Äù wrote one ethics officer in an email to Mr. Molina on Oct. 21, 2020, ‚Äúso I will have to inquire about how to commence garnishment proceedings.‚Äù  The next month, Mr. Molina accused ethics officials of discriminating against him. ‚ÄúI feel that I am being targeted and have been asked to report more than anyone else,‚Äù he wrote in a Nov. 3, 2020, email.  ‚ÄúIf the intent of these filings is to curb any corruption or misbehavior,‚Äù Mr. Molina wrote, the EPA should open an investigation. ‚ÄúI believe that paying such an outrageous fine would be an admission that I have done something wrong in this regard.‚Äù  Ethics officials didn‚Äôt investigate Mr. Molina‚Äôs trades or refer the matter to internal investigators.  On the evening of Jan. 19, 2021, Mr. Molina‚Äôs final day working for the government, EPA ethics officials offered to end the matter if he paid a discounted fine of $1,067.  Mr. Molina wrote out a personal check to ‚ÄúU.S. Treasury‚Äù and sent it to officials in the EPA‚Äôs ethics office, including to Justina Fugh, an official with whom he had clashed.,;,; 2023-05-09 11:47:25]

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 1st, 2023,;,; Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this month, and are ready for the new trading month of May. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 1st, 2023.  # **Dow gains more than 250 points Friday as index finishes best month since January: Live updates - [(Source)]( ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose on Friday, notching its best month since January. ***** &gt; The blue-chip index closed 272 points, or 0.8%, higher at 34,098.16. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.83% to finish at 4,169.48. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.69% to end at 12,226.58 as investors parsed the latest crop of technology earnings. ***** &gt; The Dow finished April 2.5% higher, its best monthly showing since January, when the average ended up 2.8%. The S&amp;P 500 logged a 1.5% monthly gain ‚Äî its second positive month in a row ‚Äî while the Nasdaq ended the month only slightly higher. ***** &gt; On a weekly basis, the Nasdaq saw the largest gain, at 1.3%, in what was considered Big Tech‚Äôs marquee earnings week. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 each finished the week about 0.9% higher. ***** &gt; Just over half of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported earnings thus far. Of those companies, 80% have beaten expectations, according to data from FactSet. That beat rate is roughly in line with a three-year average, according to data from The Earnings Scout. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe market should follow earnings,‚Äù said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management. ‚ÄúThat is the mother‚Äôs milk of the market.‚Äù ***** &gt; Amazon shares closed down nearly 4%. When reporting first-quarter results, the online retailer said its cloud business decelerated, though it did beat Wall Street‚Äôs expectations for revenue in the quarter. ***** &gt; Snap tumbled 17% following a revenue miss. Pinterest shares dropped 15.7% after issuing disappointing second-quarter revenue growth expectations. First Solar slid more than 9% after missing Wall Street expectations for the first quarter. ***** &gt; Not every tech stock was down following their respective releases. Intel shares climbed 4% after the semiconductor firm beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. ***** &gt; Data released Friday morning showed the personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.3% in March, which was in line with economist expectations. The index is a key gauge of inflation for the Federal Reserve, which has a policy meeting scheduled for next week. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúToday is reflective of sort of a three-legged stool,‚Äù said Greg Bassuk, CEO of AXS Investments. ‚ÄúEarnings, economic data and the Fed continue to be the investor narrative.‚Äù ***** &gt; Also of note, shares of troubled First Republic Bank plunged more than 43% after CNBC‚Äôs David Faber reported that the most likely outcome for the regional bank is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation taking receivership. The stock has lost more than 97% of its value since the start of the year.  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](   *****  &gt; # Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Sell In May  &gt; Buckle up, as one of the most well-known investment axioms is nearly here, the ‚ÄòSell in May and Go Away‚Äô period, otherwise known as Sell in May. This gets a ton of play in the media, as these six months are indeed the worst six-month combo out of all scenarios, while stocks also did quite poorly last year during this timeframe as well, only adding to the likely hype.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The thinking is you are better off to simply ignore these six months and go away. Turns out, from May through October the S&amp;P 500 is historically quite weak, up only 1.7% on average and higher less than 65% of the time, making it indeed the worst combo.  &gt; Of course, 1.7% is still a positive return, so maybe we shouldn‚Äôt just blindly go away? That is our take and there are other reasons not to fear these worst six months in 2023. Sure, more volatility and scary headlines could happen, but with overall market sentiment extremely bearish and the economy on firmer footing than most think, we‚Äôd use any seasonal weakness as an opportunity to add to core positions.  &gt; Here‚Äôs something I bet most investors don‚Äôt know, May has been really strong lately for stocks, higher an incredible nine of the past 10 years. Maybe we should call it Sell in June?  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Let‚Äôs take a closer look at that one year over the past decade that stocks fell in May. Turns out, one potential hiccup is May is the second worst month of the year for stocks during a pre-election year, with only September worse. In fact, these are the only two months with a negative return during a pre-election year, with May down 0.1% and September down 0.7%. Even in the bullish 2019 (when stocks gained close to 30%), stocks still lost more than 6% in May of that year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Last year was a great time to sell and go away during these historically weak six months, but that wasn‚Äôt always the case. In fact, over the past decade, stocks only fell twice these six months, last year and 2015. Looking at the past decade shows that these six months have been up nearly 5% on average versus the 1.7% return going back to 1950.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; We‚Äôve noted many times the past several months how historically strong pre-election years were for stocks, well, what about Sell in May in a pre-election year? As you can see below, the returns are right about average, up 1.8% during these six months in a pre-election year. What stands out more to me is how poorly these six months are during a midterm year, playing out well last year for sure.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Now here‚Äôs where things get quite interesting. It turns out how things are going heading into these six months can often give a clue what might happen. When stocks are down year-to-date heading into these six months the return drops to 2.3% and is higher less than a coinflip of the time. Given this was the scenario last year, along with a midterm year, maybe a rough time wasn‚Äôt such a surprise? Now the good news is when stocks are up for the year (like 2023), these worst six months actually gained more than 4% on average and were higher more than 75% of the time. This could bode well for potentially better returns these six months in 2023.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # May‚Äôs First Trading Day: S&amp;P 500 Higher 72% of the Time  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Next Monday, the first trading day of May, has a bullish history over the past 25 years. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have all averaged around 0.4% on the day. S&amp;P 500 has the best track record, up 18 times or 72% of the time since 1998. With an average gain of 0.22%, Russell 2000 is slightly weaker. May‚Äôs first trading day‚Äôs worst loss was in 2020. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 shed over 2.5% while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 dropped over 3%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](    *****  &gt; # "Big" Winners  &gt; Whenever you see a list of best-performing stocks, it‚Äôs inevitably loaded with many small stocks that most investors have never heard of. This year, though, it‚Äôs practically been the opposite trend as the two top performing stocks in the S&amp;P 500 on a YTD basis ‚Äì Meta Platforms (+96%) and Nvidia (+88%)- are not only household names but they also have market caps of more than $500 billion. We‚Äôd also note that both stocks are also more than 30 percentage points ahead of the next closest stocks in terms of top YTD returns.  &gt; With such strong returns among the largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500, the YTD performance spread between the market-cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 and its equal-weighted counterpart is among the widest ever seen on a YTD basis through the end of April. Through Friday afternoon, the market-cap-weighted S&amp;P 500 was up 8.26% while the equal-weighted index was up just 2.13%. At 6.14 percentage points, the YTD performance gap between the two indices is the second widest since 1990 trailing only the 6.8% percentage point gap in 2020. Besides 2020, the only other year where the gap was wider than two percentage points was in 1997. While it‚Äôs a small sample size and history doesn‚Äôt always repeat itself, we‚Äôd note that the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs rest-of-year performance was a gain of over 20% in both of those years. Just saying.  &gt; Besides the two other years where the performance gap was significantly wide like this year, what stands out about the chart below is how common it has historically been for the market cap-weighted index to underperform the equal weight index in the first four months of the year. Including this year, the cap-weighted index has only outperformed nine times in the last 34 years.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # 10 Weeks of Bearish Sentiment  &gt; As the S&amp;P 500 broke down to the lowest levels of April this week, bullish sentiment according to the weekly AAII survey came in at a new short-term low. After rising to 27.2% last week, only 24.1% of respondents reported as bullish this week, the lowest reading since the end of March.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; That resulted in rising bearish sentiment which rose 3.4 percentage points to 38.5%. Conversely, to bullish sentiment, that is the highest reading since the end of March.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; With inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment, the bull-bear spread has fallen deeper into negative territory meaning bears continue to outnumber bulls, and by a wider margin, although nowhere near the degree as levels seen in 2022.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; As we noted throughout 2022 and earlier this year, bears have consistently outnumbered bulls. In fact, this week marked the tenth in a row in which the bull-bear spread was negative. While that is one of only a handful of other streaks lasting for ten or more weeks going back through the history of the survey, it comes on the back of the record 44-week streak that ended this past February. That was only shortly after another 12-week streak ending in March of last year and the second longest streak on record (34 weeks long) that ended in the fall of 2020. In other words, the story remains in which sentiment has been unshakably bearish.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Some Improvement in Claims  &gt; The latest week's jobless claims data fell down to 230K from the previous week's upward revision to 246K. That 16K decline was the largest week over week drop since the first week of the month and brings claims back down to the low end of the past couple of months' range.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Before seasonal adjustment, claims were lower reaching 225.84K. That is roughly inline with the comparable weeks of last year and the few years prior to the pandemic. As shown in the second chart below, a drop in the current week of the year has very much been the norm historically. As for 2023 as a whole, unadjusted claims have remained relatively flat following the steep seasonal decline in the first weeks of the year. The potential for further seasonal strength will remain in place for the next few weeks as claims historically have reached a seasonal low in late May.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Like initial claims, seasonally adjusted continuing claims also surprised with a decline this week. Continuing claims totaled 1.858 million in the most recent week, down from 1.865 million and better than the expected increase to 1.87 million. Albeit the latest week's reading was surprisingly strong, the indicator's uptrend remains firmly in place which as we noted in last week's Bespoke Report, the overall rise in continuing claims has resembled other recessionary periods.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # S&amp;P 500 April Loss Historically Bearish for Rest of Year  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; April has been the second-best performing S&amp;P 500 month since 1950 based upon average percent gain. As of today‚Äôs close, S&amp;P 500 is down 1.3% this April. Should S&amp;P 500 close out April in the red, the outlook for the balance of the year diminishes notably. In the included table all S&amp;P 500 down Aprils since 1950 appear. Performance in May, during the ‚ÄúWorst Six Months‚Äù (May to October), the rest of the year, and the full year is also included.  &gt; When comparing S&amp;P 500 down Aprils to all Aprils and positive Aprils there historically has been a sizable reduction in average performance and frequency of gains following a down April. Average performance for the rest of the year after a down April was a loss of 0.49% compared to a gain of 7.30% after an up April and 5.06% after all Aprils. Full year S&amp;P 500 performance also dropped significantly following a down April, ‚Äì1.36% versus 13.31% in years with a positive April. But, with two trading days left, there is still a chance S&amp;P 500 avoids an April loss.  *****  &gt; # May Almanac: Second Worst S&amp;P 500 Month in Pre-Election Years  &gt; May has been a tricky month over the years, a well-deserved reputation following the May 6, 2010 ‚Äúflash crash‚Äù. It used to be part of what we once called the ‚ÄúMay/June disaster area.‚Äù From 1965 to 1984 the S&amp;P 500 was down during May fifteen out of twenty times. Then from 1985 through 1997 May was the best month, gaining ground every single year (13 straight gains) on the S&amp;P, up 3.3% on average with the DJIA falling once and two NASDAQ losses.  &gt; In the years since 1997, May‚Äôs performance has been erratic; DJIA up fourteen times in the past twenty-five years (four of the years had gains exceeding 4%). NASDAQ suffered five May losses in a row from 1998-2001, down ‚Äì11.9% in 2000, followed by thirteen sizable gains of 2.5% or better and seven losses, the worst of which was 8.3% in 2010 followed by another substantial loss of 7.9% in 2019.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Since 1950, pre-election-year Mays rank poorly, #10 DJIA, #11 S&amp;P 500, #8 NASDAQ, #8 Russell 1000 and #7 Russell 2000. Historically bullish pre-election forces do not consistently lift May. Four of the nine S&amp;P 500 pre-election year May declines exceeded 4%, the worst was a 6.6% loss in 2019. Russell 2000 gained 10.6% in May 2003, notably boosting its average gain and ranking.  *****  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; (*T.B.A.*)  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  &gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).  &gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  # DISCUSS!

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning July 3rd, 2023,;,; Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week, month, quarter and H2 ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 3rd, 2023.  # **S&amp;P 500 rises on Friday to close out big first half, Nasdaq posts best start to a year in 4 decades: Live updates - [(Source)]( ***** &gt; The S&amp;P 500 rose slightly Friday, touching the 4,300 level for the first time since August 2022 as investors looked ahead to upcoming inflation data and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest policy announcement. ***** &gt; Stocks rose Friday and technology names continued their staggering run to cap off a strong start to the year, and the best first half for the Nasdaq Composite since 1983. ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 285.18 points, or 0.84%, to close at 34,407.60. The S&amp;P 500 climbed 1.23% to end at 4,450.38, and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.45% to settle at 13,787.92. ***** &gt; Mega-cap technology stocks responsible for a sizeable chunk of 2023‚Ä≤s market gains rose Friday. Dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia jumped 3.6%, bringing its yearly gains to more than 189%. Netflix added about 2.9%, while Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Amazon rose 1.9%, 1.6% and 1.9%, respectively. Apple gained 2.3% to close above a $3 trillion market cap. ***** &gt; Elsewhere, Nike shares bucked the broad market uptrend. The apparel giant fell 2.7% after reporting a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit. ***** &gt; Friday marked a pivotal day for investors, bringing the conclusion of the month, second quarter and first half. The last six months saw 2022‚Ä≤s beaten-down growth names make a broad comeback as the promise of artificial intelligence and hope of an end to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate campaign lifted major tech players to astonishing heights. ***** &gt; Despite these strong gains, some on Wall Street expect volatility in the second half and likely profit taking from investors that benefited from the rally. This, coupled with changing technicals, could lead to sideways action, or a slight pullback in the S&amp;P, said Anna Han, equity strategist at Wells Fargo Securities. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe technicals are telling us that this ubercap-led rally has just been overextended,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been hitting those overbought levels, and we believe it‚Äôs time for that trade to kind of take a pause.‚Äù ***** &gt; This is where the major averages stand: ***** &gt; * For June: The S&amp;P 500 gained 6.5% for its best monthly performance since October. The Nasdaq advanced 6.6%. Both indexes notched a fourth consecutive positive month. The Dow climbed 4.6%, for its best month since November. &gt; * For the second quarter: The S&amp;P 500 rose 8.3%, on track for a third straight quarter of gains and its biggest quarterly advance since the fourth quarter of 2021. The Nasdaq jumped 12.8% for back-to-back positive quarters. The Dow added 3.4% for a third winning quarter. &gt; * For year to date and the first half: The S&amp;P 500 has popped 15.9% for its best first half since 2019. The Nasdaq surged 31.7%, for its best first half since 1983. The 30-stock Dow added a modest gain of 3.8%. The three major averages also notched winning weeks, gaining more than 2% each.  ***** &gt; Wall Street also got another hint of encouraging inflation news as the core personal consumption expenditures price index, a closely watched gauge by the Federal Reserve, rose less than expected in May. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThis is excellent news on the inflation fight,‚Äù said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt believe disinflation is happening, you aren‚Äôt paying attention. The Fed was right to pause and needs to hold firm at these levels to prevent overcorrecting and causing an unnecessary recession to fight a beast that is now under control.‚Äù  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # First Trading Day of July ‚Äì S&amp;P 500 Up 12 Straight  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Over the past 21 years from 2002-2022 July‚Äôs first trading has the second-best record up 85.7% of the time on the S&amp;P 500 with an average gain of 0.35%. Only August‚Äôs third to last trading day has a better record up 19 of 21 with an average gain of 0.57%.  &gt; DJIA‚Äôs first trading day of July has produced gains 76.2% of the time with an average gain of 0.31%. NASDAQ splits the middle up 81.0% (0.31% average gain) of the time. July‚Äôs first trading day is the third best performing first trading day of all twelve months based upon DJIA points gained with DJIA gaining a cumulative 1668.15 points since 1998.  &gt; Looking back even further to 1989, S&amp;P 500 has advanced 88.2% of the time (up 30 times in 34 years) with an average gain of 0.50%. DJIA has advanced 28 times in the same 34 years (82.4%) and NASDAQ has risen in 26 of those years (76.5%) with an average advance of 0.34% in all years. No other day of the year exhibits this amount of across-the-board strength, which makes a solid case for declaring the first trading day of July the most bullish day of the year over the past 34 years.  *****  &gt; # This is a Big Deal: Business Investment is Rising Again  &gt; We‚Äôve been getting a string of ‚Äúeconomic surprises‚Äù from the consumer side for several months now. Employment data is a prime example, with monthly payroll gains coming in above expectations for 14 straight months. For a change, we just got some good news from the business side, particularly business investment.  &gt; The Census Bureau collects data on manufacturers‚Äô shipments and new orders for durable goods ‚Äì big ticket items like transportation equipment (including vehicles and aircrafts), machinery, computers and electronic products, electrical equipment, and appliances, etc. New orders are particularly useful because it tells us how businesses are viewing current and future economic conditions and investing accordingly. It also tells us about future production commitments for manufacturers.  &gt; Well, new orders rose 1.7% in May, even as economists expected orders to decline almost 1%! New orders are now up 5.4% since last year, and this pace is higher than what we saw at any point in 2019.  &gt; A large part of this is because of nondefense aircraft orders, which surged 32% in May, and a whopping 61% over the past year. This is huge for America‚Äôs aircraft industry ‚Äì the recent uptrend stands in sharp contrast to what we saw in 2018-2019 when aircraft orders were declining amid Boeing‚Äôs 737-Max woes.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; However, as you can see above, aircraft orders are really volatile. It helps to strip them out, along with new orders from the defense industry (which can also be quite volatile).  &gt; What‚Äôs left is a key economic datapoint ‚Äì a category called nondefense capital goods ex aircraft, which is really a proxy for business investment, or capital expenditures (‚Äúcapex‚Äù). This rose 0.7% in May, yet another datapoint that beat forecasts (expectations were for a 0.1% increase). New orders for these ‚Äúcore capital goods‚Äù are now up 2.1% from last year and rising at a 3.2% annualized pace over the first 5 months of this year.  &gt; Now, this data is nominal, in that it‚Äôs not adjusted for prices. And we‚Äôve had a lot of inflation over the past year and a half. But even after you adjust for inflation, this proxy for business investment rose 0.3% in May, following a 0.5% increase in April. Investment in real terms has been falling since the beginning of 2022, and so the 0.8% uptick over the past two months is very welcome.  &gt; Here‚Äôs something a lot of people don‚Äôt talk about when they compare today‚Äôs economy to the pre-pandemic economy, which is widely recognized as strong: business investment collapsed in 2019, amid a lot of uncertainty around the trade war, and escalating tariffs. Hopefully, the recent uptick not only reverses the downtrend from last year, but also the pre-pandemic downtrend.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; We do recognize that two months do not make a trend. But other data also corroborate the fact that businesses are investing again.  &gt; **Something big is happening in America**  &gt; Nonresidential construction is booming, mostly thanks to manufacturing construction. I discussed what was happening a few months ago, but there has been no slowdown in the data since then. Even after adjusting for inflation, manufacturing construction is up 84% over the past year through April. Most of this is being driven by a 233% increase in construction in the computers, electronics, and electricals sector, i.e. semiconductor and electrical vehicle battery plants.  &gt; The chart below shows how manufacturing construction was stagnant across most of the past decade, but it seems to have broken out now. There was an inflection point last summer after Congress passed the CHIPS Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act (which had less to do with inflation and more to do with promoting investment via subsidies and tax credits). Also interesting, this is a phenomenon that is happening only in the US ‚Äì other developed countries like Germany, Japan, UK, and Australia are not seeing a similar surge.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Finally, if you look at just S&amp;P 500 companies, capital expenditure expectations over the next 12 months have been rising consistently this year. Forward-looking capex expectations are up almost 4% over the first six months of this year, and up 7% compared to a year ago.  &gt; This is not something that would be happening amid a slowdown, let alone a recession. The chart below shows how capex expectations were stagnant in 2019 amid higher uncertainty. That‚Äôs not the case today, even amid all the recession forecasts.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Business sentiment has been quite poor, perhaps because of all the headline-grabbing recession forecasts. However, the hard data suggests that businesses are investing and looking to expand capacity ‚Äì a sign that they view future economic conditions positively when it comes to putting money to work.  *****  &gt; # There's Something About June 29th  &gt; There must be something about June 29th. Besides being a significant day of the year from a seasonal perspective (as discussed in Wednesday's Chart of the Day), two crucial events related to some of the most significant business stories of the past two decades took place on this day, two years apart. The first involved Bernie Madoff, who infamously orchestrated the largest Ponzi scheme in history, although it is worth noting that Madoff once described the Federal Government as another Ponzi scheme, so by his logic, he would have only overseen the second largest Ponzi scheme ever. On this day in 2009, Madoff, once a highly respected and well-loved figure on Wall Street, stood alone in a Manhattan courtroom, devoid of any familial or friendly support, and received a sentence of 150 years in prison.  &gt; On a much brighter note, two years earlier in 2007, Apple fans lined up and, in some cases, camped outside of stores for days to be among the first to get their hands on the first-generation iPhone. The fact that people were willing to pay over $500 for a heretofore unproven smartphone should have been all we needed to see to know that this was going to usher in a revolution in the entire computing industry.  &gt; Given the success of the iPhone and the scandal of Madoff, you would think that the launch of the iPhone would have been a positive market event and the Madoff sentencing would be associated with a negative market environment. As the chart below illustrates, though, the exact opposite was the case. The first iPhones didn‚Äôt just go on sale within four months of any ordinary market peak; the formal launch preceded a 56%+ peak-to-trough drop in the S&amp;P 500 that was the largest drawdowns since the Great Depression. Conversely, Madoff‚Äôs sentencing came less than four months after that same largest drawdown since the Great Depression ended.  &gt; We‚Äôve said it before and we‚Äôll say it again, but investing based on the headlines can be one of the worst investment strategies known to man.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # July Historically Opens Strong, But Fades After Mid-Month  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; July is the third month of DJIA‚Äôs and S&amp;P 500‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorst Six Months‚Äù and the first month of NASDAQ‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorst Four Months.‚Äù Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital. But by around mid-month, inflows have faded and the market‚Äôs performance in July usually peaks. This tends to create a strong open and first half. In all the years examined the major indexes tend to reach a peak around mid-month and then drift sideways to slightly lower for the remainder of the month. In pre-election years since 1950, the mid-month peak and second half declines have more pronounced especially for NASDAQ and Russell 2000.  *****  &gt; # Tech Selloff Sets Up NASDAQ‚Äôs Midyear Rally  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The week after June Triple Witching delivered its expected weakness, but this sets up NASDAQ‚Äôs 12-day midyear rally to a T.  &gt; In the mid-1980s tech‚Äôs influence in the market began to grow and the market‚Äôs focus in early summer shifted to the outlook for second quarter earnings of technology companies. In anticipation of positive results, over the last three trading days of June and the first nine trading days in July, NASDAQ typically enjoys a rally. This 12-day run has been up 29 of the past 38 years with an average historical gain of 2.4%. Look for this rally to begin around June 28 and run until about July 14.  &gt; After the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000, NASDAQ‚Äôs mid-year rally had a spotty track record from 2002 until 2009 with three appearances and five no-shows in those years. However, it has been quite solid over the last thirteen years, up eleven times with two losses. Last year, NASDAQ faltered during the 12-day span, but eventually took off in the second half of July, up 12.3%.  &gt; Our strategy is to buy the close on Tuesday June 27 and sell July 14 or take profits on any sizable gain in between.  *****  &gt; # DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ historically cooler in pre-election year Julys  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter, however the mostly negative results in August and September tend to make the comparison easy. ‚ÄúHot‚Äù Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&amp;P 500 both gained greater than 6% combined with strong performances in 2013, 2018, and 2022 have boosted July‚Äôs average gains since 1950 to 1.3% and 1.3% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a ‚Äúsummer rally‚Äù, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac 2023).  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Pre-election-year July rankings are something of a mixed bag, ranking #7 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500, averaging gains of 1.0% and 0.9% respectively (since 1950); while NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979) pre-election Julys both rank #9. NASDAQ has advanced in seven of the last thirteen pre-election Julys. Russell 2000 has advanced in five of its last ten. Despite tech‚Äôs and small-cap‚Äôs meager pre-election July track record, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have averaged gains of 1.0% and 0.3% respectively.  *****  Here is the list of notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)  *****  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]( &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)  *****  Here is the full list of companies report earnings for this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 7.3.23 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) (NONE.)  &gt; # ***Monday 7.3.23 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) (NONE.)  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 7.4.23 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) (NONE.

[Negative impact of generative AI on social media stocks like meta?,;,;  I‚Äôm curious about your opinions on how generative AI will affect social media companies in the future. Generative AI is the technology that can create realistic images, videos, text, and audio based on some input or prompt. For example, you may have seen some websites that can generate fake faces or celebrities that look very convincing. In the near future, we may have entire fake influencers posting images and videos of themselves doing things when they don't even exist.  My question is: do you think generative AI will have a negative impact on social media stocks, because with so much AI generated content on the Internet, on platforms like Instagram people won‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs real and what‚Äôs fake and they will stop using it altogether? Or do you think people will still enjoy social media regardless of the authenticity of the content? Or maybe generative AI will create new opportunities for social media platforms to engage their users?  I‚Äôm interested in hearing your thoughts and arguments on this topic.,;,; 2023-03-19 02:20:27]

[Expected moves: FOMC and Facebook/Meta,;,; Tons of earnings again today, highlighted by META after the close.  META's expected move of around 8% is significantly less than the prior 3 actual moves. The last time the stock moved less than that on earnings was this quarter's report last year.          There's also a Fed meeting today! The 0DTE expected move in SPY today is about 0.7% which is not 'high' but it is a lot more than recent 0DTE expected moves which have been around 0.4%. So between the slate of earnings and the FOMC, options are pricing almost twice as much movement as they have been at these extremely low levels of IV. In fact, today's SPY options are 14 IV, they've been as low as the single digits recently. After the FOMC, options reset a bit, with the expected move into Friday just 0.9% and next week's options back to 11 IV.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Movers:**  * Warrantee Inc ADR (WRNT) +25.58% * Silicon Motion Techn ADR (SIMO) +82.91% * Snap Inc (SNAP) -17.03% * Microsoft Corp (MSFT) -3.33% * Tower Semiconductor (TSEM) +11.36% * Dish Network Corp (DISH) +9.72% * Alphabet Cl C (GOOG) +6.12% * Meta Platforms Inc (META) +2.37% * Teladoc Health Inc (TDOC) +7.51%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * Meta Platforms, Inc.

[Expected Moves: Meta, IBM, Servicenow and more.,;,; The indices are getting pulled in a couple different directions this morning due to some big-cap stocks going in different directions on earnings. Microsoft and Boeing are both higher, both slightly inside the expected move at this point. Alphabet is lower and by slightly more than what options were pricing. That mix has the DJIA going one way and the QQQ's going the other. And the SPY/SPX is saying "Waddya want from me?" (bonus points if you got that).  This afternoon we have Meta earnings. Currently, META options are pricing an almost 7.5% move. That's more than the +4.5% the stock moved last earnings but oh boy, the ones before that? +14%, +23%, and -25%. Massive moves for a company of that size/market cap.   The stock itself has been volatile over the past few months but finds itself in essentially the same place it was in early August. The stock is down about 4% from its mid-Summer highs and up about 10% from its mid-August lows.  One particular thing of note, the weekly options (expiring Friday) are 135 IV or so. The 30day IV is 50. That's a pretty big difference and it results in an expected move chart that is much straighter/flatter than normal meaning a breakeven 30-45 days on a spread trade may only be a small difference in the stock. Here's an example. A call spread expiring this week, targeting the expected move to the upside. It is 25 wide and maxes out at 337.50 to the upside. Its breakeven is 322.60 in the stock:    Compare that to a call spread targeting a level $10 higher in the stock on Dec 1st expiry:  &amp;#x200B;    The breakeven is less than $4 higher (about 1.2% in the stock), has more room to run to the upside, and an additional 35 days or so to do it. This is just a bullish example, the same would be true looking to the downside. This set-up is very similar to Netflix last week, where the earnings expiry was nearly 3x 30-day IV. As a comparison, MSFT and GOOGL yesterday were 2x. This is just one thing to look out for when choosing expiry, those IV differences can be informative, and one way to compare is via expected move levels and trade breakevens.  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Expected Moves:**  * Meta Platforms, Inc.

[My META play, taking advantage of IV crush,;,; I've been playing with ways to take advantage of IV crush with minimal downside. I've had some success with NVDA, ADBE and NFLX this year. The trade I have in META seems to fit well. The prices I listed are where I have them a few minutes before close, I legged into the trade.  Summary: I am making +$102/day calculated Theta, but still have a positive gamma. Overall, my net position is Short 7 shares (-$2292). Usually you can't collect premium without taking some risk, but in this situation I'd benefit from a large rise or fall on release of earnings.  The trade: Meta earnings July 26. META Settled today $310  Implied Volatility in the July 28 options is \~63% (Sell these)  Implied Volatility in the October 20 options is \~39% (Buy these)  Sell 1 July 28th 310 Call ($1568 Credit) Theta +$84/day  Sell 1 July 28th 310 Put ($1462 Credit) Theta +$78/day  Buy 1 Oct 20th 350 Call ($1188 Debit) Theta -$18/day  Buy 1 Oct 20th 370 Call ($753 Debit) Theta -$15/day  Buy 2 Oct 20th 285 Put ($1252 Debit) Theta -$28/day  I like this trade because a large move in the stock should pump up the October options. I'm collecting $3000 from the the July 28 options, and for that position to settle negative overall would mean I have ITM (or near ITM) options for October with plenty of time left in a stock that just moved 10%.  In no way am I suggesting this is risk free or "How can I lose!?". I can think of many ways to lose on this trade, but I'm collecting substantial premium, risk is 'capped' and a wild price move would actually be a benefit.,;,; 2023-07-18 03:05:04]
[What in the world was up with Meta and Netflix during the last 10 minutes of Friday?,;,; Both just pumped. I can see maybe Netflix being easier to move with 200b mkt cap, but Meta, at 700b mkt cap, jumping 1.5%? With Q's bleeding?   I don't get it. Was there any unusual options buying on them? ,;,; 2023-06-24 16:58:06]
[Is now a stupid time to buy leaps?,;,; I'm highly bullish on stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Meta and was thinking of buying a deep in the money leap with around a 0.8 to 0.9 delta with 1 or 2 years until expiration, and potentially selling 2 month from expiration calls against them. However, given the uncertainty in the market, I was wondering if this would be a foolish strategy to do right now and if I should consider something else/wait later for better prices.  The reason for me doing leaps is because I am long term bullish on these stocks and would like to potentially collect premium without having to spend the full amount of money of 100 shares, and also to magnify my gains  edit: probably going to go with a pmcc on Meta. Even the current price is good imo and they are sleeping giant in Generative AI,;,; 2023-05-20 21:33:46]
[Best way to grow a $500-1000 Options Account,;,; Hi, I have been doing options research on and off for a bit now and wanted to see the best way to grow this small-sized account. Are there any tickers I should watch, specific DTE, strategies, etc? My first trade was a bit back and it was based on fundamentals (correctly predicted the rise of the stock price for Canadian oil company Suncor) but holding certain options (SPY, META, etc.) for even 2-3 months ends up being more than my account balance, hence the request.,;,; 2023-03-23 19:19:57]
[Exiting in-the-money covered call position,;,; I have recently left my financial advisor due to poor performance. I discovered that she has left these two positions in my account:  META 11/17/2023 135.00 C (qty 1)  META 11/17/2023 140.00 C (qty 7)  The underlying share META was trading at $191.62 on 2/7 but is now trading at $296.  The 135 option was sold at $67.85 on 2/7 but is now trading at $162.29.  The 140 option was sold at $64 on 2/7 but is now trading at $157.30.  I don't expect the META price to change much by expiration date. I have enough shares in my account for them all to be assigned, but I don't like where this is headed.  I haven't personally traded options, but my understanding is as follows:  1. If I let them expire then the shares are assigned and I lose the opportunity cost of the shares plus any future growth. Assuming META trades at $300 on 11/17, this is approx. 700\*(300-140) + 100\*(300-135) = $128.5k loss of opportunity. 2. If I buy to close now, that will cost me ($162.29 + 7\*$157.30) \* 100 = $126.3k. The original premium received of 51.6k gets subtracted for a total loss of $74.7k if I exit now. Of course in that case I still have the shares which I can sell at 296 now, or I can keep them for future growth.  Are these my only primary options? I'm not super experienced in this, but am I in trouble?  What is the strategy to get out of a deep-in-the-money covered call position, where the price of the options themselves has gone up a lot?  thanks,;,; 2023-10-30 00:40:22]

Since they were ITM, they could be exited by RH at max loss ($250), or sent for assignment where they will result in max loss and nothing else.   Instead RH decided to exit $360, but instead of exiting $362.5 too as a pair, they exited my $90 META LEAPS position which was at a significant profit, creating a big tax event for me.

[Sell my company stock to buy QQQ, and then sell daily OTM call?,;,; I work at a tech company (one of Amazon/Meta/GOOG/MSFT) and has \~200k company stocks in hand. I have been hold QQQ positions for a long time and have been selling DTE=1 (expiry=tomorrow) OTM covered calls, and had good profits (essentially wheel strategy -- if QQQ is called away, I sell put to buy it back).  I want to apply the wheel on my company stocks, but it has only weekly options (expired on Fridays). Selling covered calls 3-5 days away leads to exercise more often than selling calls 1-day away, therefore has less profit from the covered calls.

[New Account Strategy Validity?,;,; Hi I have been doing options trading for a year now. I recently got approved to make spreads, and I was wondering about the pros and cons of the following strategy that I found out just by messing with spreads. I have a small account right now think &lt; 1K and looking to make consistent gains daily.  Sell 2 ATM money calls of a stock.  Buy 1 strike price below call and 1 strike price above call on the same stock.  As far as I can see, I stand to make a profit if the stock stays at the same price or moves sideways. If I did this for 0 DTE it seems as though I would consistently make a profit so I am curious about what would be the drawbacks. I want to clear up my doubts before I try this next week.  Another thing that I found is that if I sell another call that is 1 strike price higher than call which is 1 strike above, it seems to make some more money as long as the price doesn't move higher than a certain threshold. Consider this scenario with META. Sell 1 302.5 call, Buy 1 300 Call, Sell 2 297.5 calls, and Buy 1 295 Call. The P&amp;L chart shows me that I would profit 515 max, and wouldn't stand to lose money until META moves past 305.  Additionally, I would also be looking to do this for weeklies, but I am struggling to find stocks that consistently move sideways for weeks. Any suggestions?  Thanks for all the help. Sorry if I am overlooking something drastic,,;,; 2023-09-09 02:05:31]

[Expected moves: Microsoft and Alphabet,;,; Alphabet and Microsoft highlight a busy earnings day, both reporting after the close.  Microsoft options are pricing about a 4% move. Prior earnings saw actual moves of -4%, +7%, -1%, -8%. At 60 IV, the options expiring this week are about twice the 30-day IV. The stock itslef has not been that volatile into the event, having essentially flatlined since the first week of October. 30 day realized vol (how much the stock has been actually moving) is just 20, compared to its realized vol over the past year of 29. Sometimes it's interesting to look at trade breakevens zoomed really far out, here's an Iron Condor with strikes based on the expected move, expiring this Friday, on the one-year chart. The levels  are pretty closely aligned with the highs and lows over the past 2 and a half months or so:  &amp;#x200B;    Alphabet options are pricing about a 4.5% move. Recent earnings have seen moves of +6%, 0%, -3% and -9%. Like MSFT the stock has been flatlining the past few weeks (albeit like everything in the market it's been moving intraday and day to day, just not ending up anywhere new). It's realized vol of 22 over the past 30 days compares to the stock's 34 vol over the past year. Its weekly expiry IV of 70 is about twice its 30 day of 35, a similar 2x to MSFT.  &amp;#x200B;  **Early Movers:**  * Coca-Cola Company (KO) +3.01% * Spotify Technology S.A.

[Expected moves: SPY QQQ, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Citi.,;,; **Today's Expected Moves:**  * SPY: 0.6% * QQQ: 0.7%  &amp;#x200B;  **Earnings Season**  Earnings season kicks off in earnest on Friday with banks such as JP Morgan, Citi and Wells Fargo. Let's look at JPM's set-up. Options are pricing about a 3.1% move. That's more than 3 of the past 4 earnings actual moves, but the stock did have a move of nearly 8% in April on earnings. That 3 for 4 of the stock staying within its expected move makes sense as stocks tend to move with or stay within their earnings expected move about 65-75% of the time. Studies have shown that the number is higher (where the expected move was more than the actual move) when IV is high, and the number is lower, when IV is low. This makes sense as the more move that is expected, the larger the range for a stock to stop in. As far as the visual expected move shown below, this is another useful way to use the expected move, and compare to recent or important levels of support or resistance. In other words, is there more to the expected move's level than just the expected move?  Are there also other technical factors at that level? For instance, JPM's upper expected move of 149.22 is roughly at the same level as the stock's most recent upper range level from Sept 18th. Its bearish expected move of 140.32 is near the stock's 200 day moving average.    Finally, another thing that can be helpful to look at prior to earnings is whether there is heavy open interest at nearby strikes in the stock. In JPM's case that open interest is mostly near the money on the 145 strike and on the upside is at 150. In other words, on a very small 145 could act as a small magnet, and on a move to the upside the open interest on the 150 line could act as resistance.  These are just several factors from the options market that can be helpful going into an earnings event and analyzing risk/reward, strategy, and strike selection on new or existing trades. It's good to have a checklist before selling the move or positioning directionally to get a gut level check of how far the stock could move.  **Trending/Active Today**  * Akero Therapeutics Inc (AKRO) -62.79% * Palantir Technologies Inc Cl A (PLTR) +2.56% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +3.30% * Unity Software Inc (U) +6.16% * 89Bio Inc (ETNB) -33.81% * Pepsico Inc (PEP) +0.77% * Jd.com Inc ADR (JD) +1.88% * Meta Platforms Inc (META) +0.26% * Coherent Corp (COHR) +13.23%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * PepsiCo, Inc.

[Expected Moves: Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Snap, Boeing and more.,;,; SPY was down 2.5% last week, more than the 1.8% move options were pricing. Despite the day-to-day volatility, it is only down about 1.6% on the month. Speaking of the day-to-day volatility, intraday volatility has been even more extreme, adding to the feeling of a wild market even though it hasn't necessarily cracked or seen panic selling overall. However, certain sectors have seen steep declines recently, and the VIX is now near 22, its highest level since March. As was the case with September expiry, this week begins a new vol/gamma regime where some of the strikes that may have been acting as support or even magnets over the past week or so have expired. Keep an eye not only on the VIX this week but also the 0DTE expected moves. Currently SPY 0DTe expected moves are approaching 1% and QQQ is now over 1% each day.

[Niche ETF Option Arb Strategy,;,; There's a short-term arbitrage strategy I've been working out. I'm interested in some feedback.  Large trading floors usually have Delta One products where they manage derivative risk. The typical strategy is to short a basket of stocks (i.e. S&amp;P 500) and buy calls on the index. Some times they capture the spread and profit. Most of the time, it breaks even.  But some times these guys will short a custom basket (i.e. NASDAQ 100) and ***only*** buy calls on the big movers (i.e. AAPL, META, etc.). This creates a tremendous amount of delta exposure. Shifting the trade from delta neutral to risk arb. Some times these trades blow up because it is levered 100 to one.  Since learning about this, I've been looking to replicate this trade. But with niche ETFs that have low liquidity and mispricing (i.e. high expense ratios, discounted NAV, etc.)  Three ETFs I've looked at are:  * VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) * Global X Cybersecurity ETF (BUG) * ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK)  These are semi-cyclical, have high turnover and good liquidity.   Example trades are long June 65 HACK calls and long June 29 BUG puts. Or some straddle combination to reduce premiums with a tighter strike price.  HACK has a 16% holding turnover vs 57% at BUG. Both ETFs have similar holdings in cybersecurity stocks but the ownership stakes are very different. The bet is HACK is better managed than BUG. Similar trades can be done with IHAK and CIBR.  With SMH, I would do something similar to the S&amp;P trades and go long specific names (AMD, INTC, etc.) and short the index. Betting against the poorer performers in the supply chain index.

[Earning Reports Post Mortem for 10-27-23,;,; Movement post earnings for Q4 continues to underwhelm. Occassional few big winners like $ENPH.  I tracked these based on where the option pricing closed at the end of the week, just to save time on the analysis. Some will have moved intraday, but this really highlights most stocks aren't holding on to the moves by the end of the week. Strangle was identified based on stock pricing the Thursday prior to earnings week. With interest rates rising, and the VIX now around 22, selling options around ER might be the winning strategy. Of course if you are selling options, make sure you understand risk management and plan for assignment if you are wrong. :).  &amp;#x200B;  |Ticker|End of Week P/L|Strangle| |:-|:-|:-| |GE|\-100%|C107 / P105| |PHM|\-100%|C71 / P69| |MMM|\-100%|C88 / P86| |SNAP|\-100%|C10 / P8.5| |BA|\-100%|C185 / P180| |AR|\-100%|C28.5 / P27| |INTC|\-100%|C36 / P34.5| |AMZN|\-100%|C129 / P127| |NOW|\-88%|C560 / P557.5| |KO|\-71%|C55 / P53| |IBM|\-55%|C139 / P137| |V|\-52%|C235 / P232.5| |META|\-51%|C315 / P310| |LUV|\-50%|C24.5 / P23| |JNPR|\-38%|C26 / P24| |CHTR|\-36%|C437.5 / P432.5| |ABBV|\-21%|C146 / P144| |HSY|\-16%|C192.5 / P190| |ADM|\-4%|C74 / P72.5| |DHR|32%|C207.5 / P205| |GOOG|55%|C139 / P137| |VZ|65%|C32 / P30.5| |XOM|94%|C114 / P112| |UPS|96%|C152.5 / P150| |ENPH|96%|C116 / P114|  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-10-27 22:07:34]
[Expected moves: A little life in market vol, SPY QQQ VIX Netflix and more,;,; Stock futures are lower for the second straight day. It's a big two days for economic data, following yesterday's Fed minutes. This morning, ADP reported \~500k private sector jobs added, doubling expectations. That sent futures lower as it's yet another sign the FOMC is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer and potentially be more aggressive with raises. The US 2-year treasury yield is above 5% near this year's high, but more importantly, nearing levels it hasn't seen since 2006. Stocks have absorbed higher interest rate assumptions over the past 2 months quite well, rising with the rising yields. That played out mainly due to lessening fears of a recession (and the AI hype driving tech stocks higher). If the jobs number comes in hot tomorrow it will be just the latest data point pointing to a persistently strong economy, driving yields higher, and assumptions of a more hawkish Fed for the balance of 2023. There are signs elsewhere in the economic data of an economy that's cooling off in certain sectors, but jobs and hiring has remained strong, and we'll find out more on the front tomorrow. This 2-day pullback in stocks is breathing a little life into option vol. The VIX is now \~15.30, up from 13 just a few trading days ago.   As was mentioned in this space, vol got about as low as you'd ever see over the past two weeks. That didn't mean it would immediately go higher, but it was unlikely to go much lower. A 15.30 VIX is still historically low but it does show a little appetite for traders to buy options. Something we haven't seen much of over the past several weeks. Skew is near the highest levels of the past few years, meaning downside put strikes were already more expensive than upside call strikes. That is largely reflective of a low IV environment where the percentage differences get magnified, but keep an eye on that skew number as the VIX rises, if it remains high, it would be showing continued demand for puts even at higher vol, and therefore be a good indication of any fear in the market.   With earnings season approaching, it's also interesting to look at how low individual stock IV got and how it's pricing upcoming earnings. Netflix, which reports on the 19th, has 55 IV at the moment for the event, pricing in about an 8% move (that includes all the time leading up to the event as well.) For perspective, in Netflix's last 6 earnings, the stock has moved less than 8% just twice and has had +/-7% moves 5 out of 6 times. In other words, vol is low in most individual stocks as compared o the past 2 years, and with earnings right around the corner, you'll see much smaller expected moves on average (as of now).  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Movers:**     * Tesla Inc (TSLA) -0.44% * Allarity Therapeutics Inc (ALLR) -51.57% * Bioxcel Therapeutics Inc (BTAI) +23.73% * Genius Sports Ltd (GENI) +9.12% * Meta Platforms Inc (META) +1.70% * Lucid Group Inc (LCID) -1.48% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +0.29% * Riot Platforms Inc (RIOT) +3.24% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.16% * Affirm Holdings Inc Cl A (AFRM) -5.06% * Perion Network Ltd (PERI) +7.22%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**     * Levi Strauss &amp; Co.

[Time passage OTH/during closed markets,;,; I wanted to know if any of you have experience with modelling the change of time until expiration of an option during OTH (pre- and post-market) and when markets are closed (after post-market and before pre-market, weekends, holidays).  I've heard somewhere that holidays and weekends count for about 1/2 of a whole trading day (is that even true?), but what about the time before and after markets are open?     Also, as a bonus question, what about the different phases of RTH ‚Äì i.e. After open, before close, inbetween. I've heard that professionals weigh these times differently. If so, how?  Thanks.,;,; 2023-12-28 11:23:04]
[Expected Moves this week, SPY, VIX, QQQ, MU and more.,;,; SPY was lower last week by about 0.6%, again, inside what options were pricing. Implied vol closed extremely low into the weekend, with SPY some at-the-money SPY weekly options sporting single-digit handles. That IV should reset a bit higher out of the weekend but overall vol remains historically below average and at multi-year lows. The VIX closed last week below 13.50. Of course, vol could always go lower, but it's getting to the point where those lower moves would be quite small. In general the 12-13 range in the VIX floor over the past 5 years and only on rare occasions over longer time horizons do you see it closer to 10. That's not to say it can't remain this low for a long time, but it can't get much lower. One thing to note from the past 2 weeks, the daily realized moves of the market versus what 0DTE options had been pricing has started to tip a bit in the favor of the market moves over the expected moves, particularly in the QQQ. That kind of action tends to put a floor on IV as well as option trading in same-day expiry is heavy volume and being more or less re-priced each day based on the prior day's result. Futures are flat to lower to start off the week.  This past weekend included some political chaos in Russia but markets this week will most likely concentrate on a combo of economic data like GDP &amp; Durable Goods and speeches by Lagarde (tues) and Powell (wed, thurs). SPY options are pricing about a 1.1% move for the week at 10 vol (at the money) although that could get a lift on the open. The earnings calendar this week is slow but steady, with Micron (MU) a highlight on Wednesday.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Actives:**  * Lucid Group Inc (LCID) +7.86% * Tesla Inc (TSLA) -2.27% * Trxade Health Inc (MEDS) +60.43% * Eco Wave Power Global Ab ADR (WAVE) +22.11% * Marathon Digital Hldgs Inc (MARA) -3.30% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.19% * Alphabet Cl A (GOOGL) -1.65% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.33% * Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) +0.11% * Coinbase Global Inc Cl A (COIN) -1.84%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (CCL) Expected Move: 9.75% * Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (CUK) Expected Move: 13.06%  Full list here: [Options AI Earnings Calendar](  &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar:**  * At 10:30 AM (EST) Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index (Jun) Estimates: -26.5, Prior: -29.1  &amp;#x200B;  **Scanner Highlights:**  * Overbought (RSI): CCL (79), META (78), KMX (73), JNJ (72), ADBE (72), LLY (71), AAPL (70) * Oversold (RSI): OXY (31), PENN (31), DOCU (35), CHPT (36), MRNA (36), GS (36) * High IV: MANU (+212%), ATVI (+194%), VMW (+167%), NKE (+107%), AZN (+105%), IBM (+105%), TSLA (+103%) * Unusual Options Volume: KMX (+981%), MARA (+510%), COIN (+468%), SNAP (+416%), CCL (+343%), META (+310%), MSTR (+309%)  &amp;#x200B;  **Chart of the Day**  Some SPY options have seen IV marks below 10 recently.   2023-06-26 11:09:21]
[Expected moves: VIX pickup, SPY, QQQ Grind lower. Rare Friday Earns from Palo Alto,;,; Stocks are lower again to start Friday. It's been a rough week overall, with the SPY down about 2.5% or so. That's more than double the move options were pricing, and the moves have been a bit more than 0DTE options have been pricing each day. Near-term options are waking up a bit, with 0DTE pricing in expected moves for SPY now out at about 0.7% or so each day, that's up from just 0.4% a few weeks ago. The VIX is now near 19 meaning 30-day vol is back to about its historical average. One interesting data point to add to this is that the SPY itself has not been THAT volatile. It's off a bit more than 5% from its highs, and the recent selling has been a grind lower, not much panic selling. That's not just a *vibe*, the realized vol in SPY for the past 30 days is still just 10. That will likely begin to increase a bit with the past week seeing moves in excess of what options were pricing, but again, the selling has been orderly in the major indices thus far.  Nothing on the economic data front today but next week is the Jackson Hole Conference which takes on some additional significance after this week's more hawkish than expected FOMC minutes as well as what's going on in China's markets.  A rare after-hours on Friday earnings report today from Palo Alto Networks. That may have some traders spooked a bit as it does feel like a Friday news dump (where you'd try to bury bad news when everyone is already away from their desks). However, the last SP 500 company to do the same was Nike in 2020 and that report was good. So who knows. Here's how options are trying to price the event, an odd one as you have to go out to next Friday's options, not today's, to trade options that capture the event:  &amp;#x200B;    The 8% move matches that prior reports actual move of +8%.

[5K to trade options (Wheel, CCS PDS ...),;,; tldr; I'm not asking for anyone's trade's. Just some companies other than those listed below that would be good to trade options in with a 2nd account I've started.      I opened a second trading account strictly for options trading and I'm participating with other traders ranging from Pro's to Beginners. I've done options trading before, I am a little rusty on them after taking some time off from trading (mostly due to the low market last year) I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on companies I could do some DD in and make a few trades to grow it up to 10K and hopefully eventually to 25K.

[Expected moves: Netflix, Tesla and more.,;,; The second round of big bank earnings are out with Bank of America, PNC and Morgan Stanley reporting this morning. The results have not been market-moving as of yet. MS is unched as of now, with BAC down slightly, both with moves less than options were pricing. PNC is down about 3% vs a 3.5% expected move. So the reactions are pretty muted all things considered. The broader market thinks the same, with futures all red but very slightly. Most of the bank stocks were lower over the past 3 months with the exception of JPM. JPM has also performed the best from the bank stocks that reported last week, initially giving up its earnings move gains but recovering much of them with a strong up day yesterday.

[Expected moves today, Powell, SPY, VIX,;,; Futures are lower for a 3rd straight day as the market waits for Fed Chair Powell's testimony in front of Congress. Some of his prepared remarks were released before the bell. The 3 day losing streak hasn't added up to much of a sell-off as of yet. The SPY is lower by about 1.5% since an intra-week high last Thursday. Nor has it affected vol much, the VIX is even lower than it was during that Thursday high in stocks.   As mentioned alot recently, yes vol is low, but the moves in the market are also very muted. The realized vol in SPY over the past month now sits at 12. Options in SPY are about 11 vol for the upcoming few weeks. In other words, IV is currently reflective of how the market is moving. Therefore option buyers are still having to get direction correct and be very nimble, despite how "cheap" vol is. Short-term option trading is basically a battle between implied vol, and realized vol. The mean reversion of IV (buying low IV, selling high IV) typically needs more time to play out. Speaking of that, when vol is this low for this long it's sometimes helpful to begin to look out a few months and see how low IV has been dragged down by what's happening recently. A look at SPY vol out in November and December shows at-the-money vol around 15-16. To put that in perspective, that's both below historical averages for IV, but it's also much lower than the realized vol if SPY over the past year, which is around 20, even with the slow grind of the past few months.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Action:**  * Tesla Inc (TSLA) +0.54% * Marathon Digital Hldgs Inc (MARA) +5.38% * Riot Platforms Inc (RIOT) +3.82% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +0.96% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.66% * Coinbase Global Inc Cl A (COIN) +2.89% * Opendoor Technologies Inc (OPEN) +4.23% * Alibaba Group Holding ADR (BABA) -0.65% * Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) +0.24% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.33% * Carvana Company Cl A (CVNA) +0.55% * Li Auto Inc ADR (LI) +3.14% * C3.Ai Inc Cl A (AI) -0.76%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * KB Home (KBH) Expected Move: 7.97% * Winnebago Industries, Inc.

[Expected moves, NFP jobs, SPY, VIX Apple and more.,;,; Non Farm Payrolls drop at 8:30 ET and suddenly take on new significance after the market reaction yesterday to ADP employment data. As pointed out in this space a few times recently, stocks have largely ignored rising treasury yields (higher interest rate assumptions) over the past few months as the fears of a bad recession faded a little. But with recent strong data and hawkish words from the Fed, yields have plowed higher and traders showed some concern for the first time in a while the past 2 days. The 1-year yield is now at its highest level since 2000, the 2yr traded yesterday at its highest level since 2006 and the 10yr is at its highest level since 2007. Where yields go next are likely to affect the market's next moves and the NFP this morning will be the last data point in a slew of news we received in the second part of this week. The VIX got as high as 17 yesterday, indicating some renewed interest in option buying. It pulled back a bit late and is now 15.80. But this is the first bit of life option buyers have shown in months. Futures are basically unchanged into the NFP print.

[Expected Moves: Low IV Trading and Earnings from Netflix, Tesla, Goldman, IBM and more.,;,; ## Market View  **Last Week ‚Äì Closing with a VIX Level we haven‚Äôt seen in years**  SPY finished higher by about 0.8% last week, another fairly quiet move inside what options were pricing (+/- 1.6%). The VIX was lower on the week and its closing low Friday near 17 is its lowest level since the late 2021all time market highs. The range on the week was also inside the expected move, with less than a 1.5% difference between the intra-week highs and lows. In other words, IV is low, but realized moves for the past few weeks have been even less.  **This Week ‚Äì Earnings heat up as IV cools**  SPY options are pricing just a 1.1% move for the upcoming week. That‚Äôs as low a move as we‚Äôve seen in quite some time, a factor traders need to be aware of into what could be some idiosyncratic moves in individual stocks as they begin to report. A good example came Friday as several of the large banks reported. The banking system has obviously been a focus for traders the past month, and banks giving insight in that environment would typically come in high vol environment. But because the market had stabilized since the regional bank chaos, the big banks that reported on Friday actually reported in a low IV environment. The result was two of the banks, PNC and Wells Fargo barely moving, well inside their expected moves, while the two that did see moves (JPM and Citi) nearly doubled their expected moves to the upside.  A general rule of thumb on expected moves into earnings is that a stock will stay at or inside its expected move roughly 70% of the time. But the IV backdrop does factor into those numbers. When IV is historically high, it is more likely that a stock stays within its expected move, with the moves outside expectations sometimes massive, but occurring less often. However, when the IV backdrop is low, moves outside expectations tend to happen more often, but the outsized moves themselves tend to be less massive. This makes sense intuitively. Had JPM reported in the middle of the banking turmoil of last month, and shown a net inflow of deposits from regional banks, while its IV, and the market‚Äôs overall IV had been alot higher, its move may have been even more. And that‚Äôs not just due to sentiment, although that‚Äôs a big factor, but it also has to do with the amount of short gamma that is in the market at high IV levels. High IV can create air pockets for stocks to move through. Whereas lower IV backdrops can create a long gamma backdrop, acting as a governor on moves.  The TL:DR version of that is that moves in low-vol environments are smaller overall, with less short gamma in the market. But because the expected move is so much smaller as well, moves outside expectations happen more often. The 4 banks that reported Friday are a small sample size, but the fact that two barely moved, and the other two doubled their expected move on a move that would have been considered normal just a few weeks ago, is a good illustration.  So what does that mean for trade strategies? Credit spreads create really tight windows for a stock to stay within, and it will often be self-fulfilling. The fact that the SPY‚Äôs last two weeks saw moves of just 0.4% and 0.8% is indicative of that. However, when a stock does violate that expected move, it won‚Äôt take much, and is likely to happen slightly more often. Credit Spreads should be defined risk because the premium received is not enough to make up for the fact that a % move of a couple percent could be a 4x loss. And debit spreads could look to take advantage of that as well. For instance, the likelihood of a massive move on earnings of 20% in a low IV/long gamma environment of a stock expecting a 5% move is very unlikely, however, that stock moving 6-7%, slightly beyond the expected move will happen more often. And because of that, a debit spread at the expected move could see a 3-4x return when that stock goes beyond expectations.  E.G., a stock trading $100 with a 5% expected move, the trader looking to sell premium should be very careful to define risk narrowly, perhaps a dollar wide at or beyond the expected move, so that a move to $92 or $108 (beyond the tight $95 to $105 expected move) doesn‚Äôt cause outsized losses. And on the flipside, there can be an opportunity for a long premium trader looking for a move beyond $95 or $105, with say a 105/106 call spread or a 95/94 put spread, rather than a lotto ticket call or put. The chances that the stock will make a massive move is less likely, but the chance it will move slightly beyond the move, is a slightly more frequent occurrence in low IV.  *Note, although a 17 VIX is the lowest level for the past few years, it isn‚Äôt super low historically and could just be a blip before it goes higher, or it could go much lower (mid to low teens is historically low). However, it is now lower than the historical mean, something we haven‚Äôt seen much of in recent years*.  &amp;#x200B;    &amp;#x200B;  **Expected Moves for This Week**¬†([via Options AI](  * SPY¬†**1.1%** * QQQ **1.6%**¬† * IWM¬†**1.7%**  * DIA¬†**1.1%**   **Economic Calendar**  * Tuesday ‚Äì **Housing starts, Fed Speech (Bowman)** * Thursday ‚Äì **Initial jobless claims, Philly Manufacturing**  **Unusual Option Volume Thursday**  * BA, HON, NVDA, BUD, META, NFLX, SCHW  ##   ## Earnings This Week  Via the [Options AI Earnings Calendar]( (free to use) showing expected moves as currently priced and past moves for comparison.  ***Monday***  * **Charles Schwab SCHW ‚Äì Expected Move: 8%** \[Prior\] -3% -2% -2  ***Tuesday***  * **Bank of America BAC ‚Äì** Expected Move: 4.3% \[Prior\] +2% +6% 0% * **Goldman Sachs ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.4% \[Prior\] -6% +2% +3% * **Lockheed Martin LMT ‚Äì** Expected Move: 2.4% \[Prior\] +2% +9% +1 -2% * **Netflix NFLX** ‚Äì Expected Move: 7.4% \[Prior\] +8% +13% +7% -35% * **United Airlines UAL** ‚Äì Expected Move: 5.2% \[Prior\] -1% +5% +1% +1%  ***Wednesday***  * **Morgan Stanley MS ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.6% \[Prior\] +6% -5% 0% * **ASML Holding ASML ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.7% \[Prior\] +2% +6% +3% +3% * **Tesla TSLA ‚Äì** Expected Move: 7% \[Prior\] +11% -7% +10% +3% * **IBM IBM ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.7% \[Prior\] -5% +5% -5% +7%  ***Thursday***  * **Taiwan Semi TSM ‚Äì** Expected Move: 4.3% \[Prior\] +6% +4% +3% * **American Express AXP ‚Äì** Expected Move: 3.7% \[Prior\] +10% -2% +2% -3%,;,; 2023-04-16 18:45:00]

[Understanding Implied Forwards,;,;    These are not trick questions:  Suppose you have an 85 average on the first 4 tests of the semester. There‚Äôs one test left. All tests have an equal value in your final score. You need a 90 average for an A in the class.  What do you need on the last test to get an A in the class?  What is the maximum score you can get for the semester?  If you are comfortable with the math you have the prerequisites required to learn about a useful finance topic ‚Äî implied forwards!  Implied forwards can help you:  * find trading opportunities * understand arbitrage and its limits  We‚Äôll start in the world of interest rates.  # The Murkiness Of Comparing Rates Of Different Maturities  Consider 2 zero-coupon bonds. One that matures in 11 months and one that matures in 12 months. They both mature to $100.  **Scenario A: The 11-month bond is trading for $92 and the 12-month bond is trading for $90.**  What are the annualized yields of these bonds if we assume continuous compounding?[1](   Computing the 12-month yield  r = ln($100/$90) = 10.54%   Computing the 11-month yield  r = ln($100/$92) \* 12/11 = 9.10%  This is an ascending yield curve. You are compensated with a higher interest rate for tying up your money for a longer period of time.  But it is very steep.  You are picking up 140 extra basis points of interest for just one extra month.  Let‚Äôs do another example.  **Scenario B: We‚Äôll keep the 12-month bond at $90 but say the 11-month bond is trading for only $91.**  Computing the 11-month yield  r = ln($100/$91) \* 12/11 = 10.29%  So now the 11-month bond yields 10.29% and the 12-month bond yields 10.54%  You still get paid more for taking extra time risk but maybe it looks more reasonable. It‚Äôs kind of hard to reason about 25 bps for an extra month. It‚Äôs murky.  Think back to the test score question this post opened with. There is another way of looking at this if we use a familiar concept ‚Äî the weighted average.  # The Implied Forward Interest Rate  We can think of the 12-month rate as the average rate over all the intervals. Just like a final grade is an average of the individual tests.  We can decompose the 12-month rate into the average of an **11-month rate** plus a **month-11 to month-12 forward rate:**  *‚Äú12-month‚Äù rate = ‚Äú11-month‚Äù rate + ‚Äú11 to 12-month‚Äù forward rate*  Let‚Äôs return to scenario A:  12-month rate = 10.54%  11-month rate = 9.1%  Compute the ‚Äú11 to 12-month‚Äù forward rate like a weighted average:  10.54% x 12 = 9.1% x 11 + Forward Rate‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ‚Çã‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ x 1  Forward Rate‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ‚Çã‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ = 26.37%  We knew that 140 bps was a steep premium for one month but when you explicitly compute the forward you realize just how obnoxious it really is.  How about scenario B:  12-month rate = 10.54%  11-month rate = 10.29%  Compute the ‚Äú11 to 12-month‚Äù forward rate like a weighted average:  10.54% x 12 = 10.29% x 11 + Forward Rate11‚Äì12 x 1  Forward Rate11‚Äì12 = 13.26%  # Arbitraging The Forward Rate (Sort Of)  It‚Äôs common to have a dashboard that shows term structures. But the slopes between months can be optically underwhelming with such a view. Seeing that the implied forward rate is 13.26% feels more profound than seeing a 25 bps difference between month 11 and month 12.  You may be thinking, ‚Äúthis forward rate is a cute spreadsheet trick, but it‚Äôs not a rate that exists in the market.‚Äù  Let‚Äôs take a walk through a trade and see if we can find this rate in the wild.  The first step is just to ground ourselves in a basic example before we understand what it means to capture some insane forward rate.  Consider a flat-term structure:  &amp;#x200B;       \[Note: the forward rate should be 10.54% but because I‚Äôm computing YTM on a bond price that only goes to 2 decimal places we are getting an artifact. It‚Äôs immaterial for these demonstrations\]  Now let‚Äôs look back at the steep term structure from scenario A:  &amp;#x200B;       With an 11-month rate of 9.10% and a 12-month rate of 10.54% we want to borrow at the shorter-term rate and lend at the longer-term rate. That means selling the nearer bond and buying the longer bond.  When you study asset pricing, one of the early lessons is to step through the cash flows. This is the basis of arbitrage pricing theory (APT), a way of thinking about asset values according to their arbitrage or boundary conditions. As opposed to other pricing models, for example CAPM, someone using APT says the price of an asset is X because if it weren‚Äôt there would be free money in the world. By walking through the cash flows, they would then show you the free money[2]( The fair APT price is the one for which there is no free money.  ## Stepping Thru The Cash Flows  Let‚Äôs see how this works:  Today  1. We short the 11-month bond at $92 2. We buy 1.022 12-month bonds for $90. We can buy 1.022 of the cheaper bonds from the proceeds of selling the more expensive $92 bond. The net cash flow or outlay is $0. 3. Spend the next 11 months surfing.  At the 11-month maturity  We will need $100 to pay the bondholder of the 11-month bond so we sell 12-month bonds.  But for what price?  Well, let‚Äôs say the prevailing 1-month interest rate matched the rates we were seeing in the flat term structure world of 10.49%, the rate implied by the 11‚Äì12 month forward when we initiated the trade.  In that case, the bonds we own are worth $99.13.  \[With one month to maturity we compute the continuous YTM: ln(100/99.13) \* 12 = 10.49%\]  If we sell 1.009 of our bonds at $99.13 we can raise the $100 to pay back the loan. We are left with .0134 bonds.  At the 12-month maturity  Our stub of .0134 bonds mature and we are left with $1.34.  So what was our net return?  Hmm, lemme think, carry the one, uh ‚Äî infinite!  We did a zero cash flow trade at the beginning. We didn‚Äôt lay out any money and ended with $1.34.  That‚Äôs what happens when you effectively shorted a 26.37% forward rate but the one-month rate has rolled down to something normal, in this case about 10.50%  \[In real life there is all kind of frictions ‚Äî you know like, collateral when you short bonds.\]  Summary table:  &amp;#x200B;       What if somehow, that crazy 26.37% ‚Äú11‚Äì12 month forward rate‚Äù didn‚Äôt roll down to a reasonable spot rate but actually turned out to be a perfect prediction of what the 1-month rate would be in 11 months?  Let‚Äôs skip straight to the summary table.  &amp;#x200B;       Note the big difference in this scenario: the bond with 1 month remaining until maturity is only worth $97.83 (corresponding to that 26.33% yield, ignore small rounding). So you need to sell all 1.022 of the bonds to raise $100 to pay back the loan.  Besides frictions, you can see why this is definitely not an arbitrage ‚Äî if the 1-month rate spiked even higher than 26.33% the price of the bonds would be lower than $97.83. You would have sold all 1.022 of your bonds and still not been able to repay the $100 you owe!  So the ‚Äúborrow short, lend long‚Äù trade is effectively a way to short a 1-month forward at 26.33%. It might be a good trade but it‚Äôs not free money.  Still, this exercise shows how our measure of the forward is a tradeable level!  \[If you went through the much more arduous task of adjusting for all the real-world frictions and costs you would impute a forward rate that better matched what you considered to be a ‚Äútradeable price‚Äù. The principle is the same, the details will vary. I was not a fixed-income trader and own all the errors readers discover.\]  # The Implied Forward Implied Volatility  Now you‚Äôre warmed up.  Like interest rates, implied volatilities have a term structure. Every pair of expiries has an implied forward volatility. The principle is the same. The math is almost the same.  With interest rates we were able to do the weighted average calculation by multiplying the rates by the number of days or fraction of the year. That‚Äôs because there is a linear relationship between time and rates. If you have an un-annualized 6-month rate, you simply double it to find the annualized rate. You can‚Äôt do that with volatility.[3](  The solution is simple. Just square all the implied volatility inputs so they are variances. Variance is proportional to time so you can safely multiply variance by the number of days. Take the square root of your forward variance to turn it back into a forward volatility.  Consider the following hypothetical at-the-money volatilities for BTC:  &amp;#x200B;       Let‚Äôs compute the 20-to-30 day implied forward volatility. We follow the same pattern as the weighted test averages and weighted interest rate examples.  The decomposition where DTE = ‚Äúdays to expiry‚Äù:  ‚Äúvariance for 30 days‚Äù = ‚Äúvariance for 20 days‚Äù + ‚Äúvariance from day 20 to 30‚Äù  *Expiry2 variance \* DTE til Expiry2 = Expiry1 variance \* DTE til expiry1 + Forward variance*‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ‚Çã‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ *\* Days*‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ‚Çã‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ  Re-arrange for forward variance:  *Fwd Variance*‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ‚Çã‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ *= (Expiry2 variance \* DTE til Expiry2 ‚Äî Expiry1 variance \* DTE til expiry1) / Days*‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ‚Çã‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ  *Fwd Variance*‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ‚Çã‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ *= (.1764 \* 30 ‚Äî .16 \* 20) / 10*  *Fwd Variance*‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ‚Çã‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ *= .2092*  Turning variance back into volatility:  ‚àö.2092 = **45.7%**  If the 20-day option implies 40% vol and the 30-day option implies 42% vol, then it makes sense that the vol between 20 and 30 days must be higher than 42%. The 30-day volatility includes 42% vol for 20 days, **so the time contained in the 30-day option that DOES NOT overlap with the 20-day option must be high enough to pull the entire 30-day vol up.**  This works in reverse as well. If the 30-day implied volatility were lower than the 20-day vol, then the 20‚Äì30 day forward vol would need to be lower than the 30-day volatility.  **The Arbitrage Lower Bound of a Calendar Spread**  The fact that the second expiry includes the first expiry creates an arbitrage condition (at least in equities). An American-style time spread cannot be worth less than 0. In other words, a 50 strike call with 30 days to expiry cannot be worth less than a 50 strike call with 20 days to expiry.  Here‚Äôs a little experiment (use ATM options, it will not work if the options are far OTM and therefore have no vega):  *Pull up an options calculator where you make a time spread worth 0.*  I punched in a 9-day ATM call at 39.6% vol and a 16-day ATM call at 29.70001% vol. These options are worth the same (for the $50 strike ATM they are both worth $1.24).  Now compute the implied forward vol.  &amp;#x200B;       You can predict what happens when we weight the variance by days:  Expiry1 = .157 \* 9 = 1.411  Expiry2 = .088 \* 16 = 1.411  Expiry 2 has the same total variance as Expiry 1 which means there is zero implied variance between day 9 and day 16.  The square root of zero is zero. That‚Äôs an implied forward volatility of zero!  A possible interpretation of zero implied forward vol:  *The market expects a cash takeover of this stock to close no later than day 9 with 100% probability.*  # A Simple Tool To Build  With a list of expirations and corresponding ATM volatility, you can construct your own forward implied volatility matrix:  &amp;#x200B;       # Arbitrage?  Like the interest rate forward example, there‚Äôs no arbitrage in trying to isolate the forward volatility unless you can buy a time spread for zero.[4](  For most of the past decade, implied volatility term structures have been ascending (or ‚Äúcontango‚Äù for readers who once donned a NYMEX or CBOT badge). If you sell a fat-looking time spread you have a couple major ‚Äúgotchas‚Äù to contend with:  1. Weighting the trade   If you are short a 1-to-1 time spread you are short both vega, long gamma, paying theta. This is not inherently good or bad. But you need a framework for choosing which risks you want and at what price (that statement is basically the bumper sticker definition of trading imbued simultaneously with truth and banality). If you want to bet on the time spread narrowing, ie the forward vol declining, then you need to ratio the trades. The end of [*Moontower On Gamma*]( discusses that. Even then, you still have problems with path-dependence because the gamma profile of the spread will change as soon as the underlying moves. The reason people trade variance swaps is that the gamma profile of the structure is constant over a wide range of strikes providing even exposure to the realized volatility. Sure you could implement a time spread with variance swaps, but you get into idiosyncratic issues such as bilateral credit risk and greater slippage. 2. The bet, like the interest rate bet, comes down to what the longer-dated instrument does outright.You were trying to isolate the forward vol, but as time passes your net vega grows until eventually the front month expires and you are left with a naked vol position in the longer-dated expiry and your gamma flips from highly positive to negative (assuming the strikes were still near the money).  Term structure bets are usually not described as bets on forward volatility bets but more in the context of harvesting a term premium as time passes and implied vols ‚Äúroll down the term structure‚Äù. This is a totally reasonable way to think of it, but using an implied forward vol matrix is another way to measure term premiums.  # The Wider Lessons  ## Process  Forwards vols represent another way to study term structures. Since term structures can *shift*, *slope*, and *twist* you can make bets on the specific movements using outright vega, time spreads, and time butterflies respectively. A tool to measure forward vols is a thermometer in a doctor‚Äôs bag. How do we conceptually situate such tools in the greater context of diagnosis and treatment?  Here‚Äôs my personal approach. Recognize that there are many ways to skin a cat, this is my own.  1. I use dashboards with cross-sectional analysis as the top of an ‚Äúopportunity funnel‚Äù. You could use highly liquid instruments to calibrate to a fair pricing of parameters (skew, IV risk premium, term premium, wing pricing, etc) in the world at any one point in time. This is not trivial and why I emphasize that trading is more about [measurement than prediction]( To compare parameters you need to normalize across asset types.   To demonstrate just how challenging this is, an interview question I might ask is: *Price a 12-month option on an ETF that holds a rolling front-month contract on the price of WTI crude oil*[5]( wouldn‚Äôt need the answer to be bullseye accurate. I‚Äôm looking for the person‚Äôs understanding of arbitrage-pricing theory which is fundamental to being able to normalize comparisons between financial instruments. The answer to the question requires a practical understanding of replicating portfolios, walking through the time steps of a trade, and computing implied forward vols on assets with multiple underlyers. (Beyond pricing, actually trading such a derivative requires understanding the differences in flows between SEC and CFTC-governed markets and who the bridges between them are.) 2. The contracts or asset classes that ‚Äústick out‚Äù become a list of candidates for research. There are 2 broad steps for this research.  * Do these ‚Äúmispriced‚Äù parameters reveal an opportunity or just a shortcoming in your normalization?   Sleuthing the answer to that may be as simple as reading something publically available or could require talking to brokers or exchanges to see if there‚Äôs something you are missing. If you are satisfied to a degree of certainty commensurate with the edge in the opportunity that you are not missing anything crucial, then you can move to the next stage of investigation. * Understanding the flow   What flow is causing the mispricing? What‚Äôs the motivation for the flow? Is it early enough to bet with it? Is it late enough to bet against it? You don‚Äôt want to trade the first piece of a large order but you will not get to trade the last piece either (that piece will be either be fed to the people who got hurt trading with the flow too early as a favor from the broker who ran them over ‚Äî trading is a tit-for-tat iterated game, or internalized by the bank who controls the flow and knows the end is near.)  3. Execute  Suppose you determine that the term structure is too cheap compared to a ‚Äúfair term structure‚Äù as triangulated by an ensemble of cross-sectional measurements. Perhaps, there is a large oil refiner selling gasoline calls to hedge their inventory (like covered calls in the energy world). You can use the forward vol matrix to drill down to the expiry you want to buy. ‚ÄúAh, the 9-month contract looks like the best value according to the matrix. Let‚Äôs pull up a montage and see if it‚Äôs really there. Let‚Äôs see what the open interest is?‚Ä¶‚Äù  As you examine quotes from the screens or brokers, you may discover that the tool is just picking up a stale bid/ask or wide market, and that the cheapest term isn‚Äôt really liquid or tradeable. This isn‚Äôt a problem with the tool, it‚Äôs just a routine data screening pitfall. The point is that tools of this nature can help you optimize your trade expression in the later stage of the funnel.  ## Meta-understanding  This discussion of forward vols was like month 1 learning at SIG. It‚Äôs foundational. It‚Äôs also table stakes. Every pro understands it. I‚Äôm not giving away trade secrets. I am not some EMH maxi[6]( but I‚Äôll say I‚Äôve been more impressed than not at how often I‚Äôll explore some opportunity and be discouraged to know that the market has already figured it out. The thing that looks mispriced often just has features that are overlooked by my model. This doesn‚Äôt become apparent until you dig further, or until you put on a trade only to get bloodied by something you didn‚Äôt account for as a particular path unfolds.  This may sound so negative that you may wonder why I even bother writing about this on the internet. Most people are so far out of their depth, is this even useful? My answer is a confident ‚Äúyes‚Äù if you can learn the right lesson from it:  **There is no silver bullet. Successful trading is the sum of doing many small things correctly including reasoning. Understanding arbitrage-pricing principles is a prerequisite for establishing what is baked into any price. Only from that vantage point can one then reason about why something might be priced in a way that doesn‚Äôt make sense and whether that‚Äôs an opportunity or a trap**[7]( **By slowly transforming your mind to one that compares any trade idea with its arbitrage-free boundary conditions or replicating portfolio/strategy, you develop an evergreen lens to ever-changing markets.**  **You may only gain or handle one small insight from these posts. But don‚Äôt be discouraged. Understanding is like antivenom. It takes a lot of cost and effort to produce a small amount**[8]( **If you enjoy this process despite its difficulty then it‚Äôs a craft you can pursue for intellectual rewards and profit.**  **If profit is your only motivation, at least you know what you‚Äôre up against.**,;,; 2023-06-24 18:14:47]

[Expected moves: FOMC and Facebook/Meta,;,; Tons of earnings again today, highlighted by META after the close.  META's expected move of around 8% is significantly less than the prior 3 actual moves. The last time the stock moved less than that on earnings was this quarter's report last year.          There's also a Fed meeting today! The 0DTE expected move in SPY today is about 0.7% which is not 'high' but it is a lot more than recent 0DTE expected moves which have been around 0.4%. So between the slate of earnings and the FOMC, options are pricing almost twice as much movement as they have been at these extremely low levels of IV. In fact, today's SPY options are 14 IV, they've been as low as the single digits recently.

[Expected Moves: Meta, IBM, Servicenow and more.,;,; The indices are getting pulled in a couple different directions this morning due to some big-cap stocks going in different directions on earnings. Microsoft and Boeing are both higher, both slightly inside the expected move at this point. Alphabet is lower and by slightly more than what options were pricing. That mix has the DJIA going one way and the QQQ's going the other. And the SPY/SPX is saying "Waddya want from me?" (bonus points if you got that).  This afternoon we have Meta earnings. Currently, META options are pricing an almost 7.5% move. That's more than the +4.5% the stock moved last earnings but oh boy, the ones before that? +14%, +23%, and -25%. Massive moves for a company of that size/market cap.   The stock itself has been volatile over the past few months but finds itself in essentially the same place it was in early August. The stock is down about 4% from its mid-Summer highs and up about 10% from its mid-August lows.  One particular thing of note, the weekly options (expiring Friday) are 135 IV or so. The 30day IV is 50. That's a pretty big difference and it results in an expected move chart that is much straighter/flatter than normal meaning a breakeven 30-45 days on a spread trade may only be a small difference in the stock. Here's an example. A call spread expiring this week, targeting the expected move to the upside. It is 25 wide and maxes out at 337.50 to the upside. Its breakeven is 322.60 in the stock:    Compare that to a call spread targeting a level $10 higher in the stock on Dec 1st expiry:  &amp;#x200B;    The breakeven is less than $4 higher (about 1.2% in the stock), has more room to run to the upside, and an additional 35 days or so to do it. This is just a bullish example, the same would be true looking to the downside. This set-up is very similar to Netflix last week, where the earnings expiry was nearly 3x 30-day IV. As a comparison, MSFT and GOOGL yesterday were 2x. This is just one thing to look out for when choosing expiry, those IV differences can be informative, and one way to compare is via expected move levels and trade breakevens.  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Expected Moves:**  * Meta Platforms, Inc.

[Expected Moves: Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Snap, Boeing and more.,;,; SPY was down 2.5% last week, more than the 1.8% move options were pricing. Despite the day-to-day volatility, it is only down about 1.6% on the month. Speaking of the day-to-day volatility, intraday volatility has been even more extreme, adding to the feeling of a wild market even though it hasn't necessarily cracked or seen panic selling overall. However, certain sectors have seen steep declines recently, and the VIX is now near 22, its highest level since March. As was the case with September expiry, this week begins a new vol/gamma regime where some of the strikes that may have been acting as support or even magnets over the past week or so have expired. Keep an eye not only on the VIX this week but also the 0DTE expected moves. Currently SPY 0DTe expected moves are approaching 1% and QQQ is now over 1% each day.

[Expected moves: SPY QQQ, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Citi.,;,; **Today's Expected Moves:**  * SPY: 0.6% * QQQ: 0.7%  &amp;#x200B;  **Earnings Season**  Earnings season kicks off in earnest on Friday with banks such as JP Morgan, Citi and Wells Fargo. Let's look at JPM's set-up. Options are pricing about a 3.1% move. That's more than 3 of the past 4 earnings actual moves, but the stock did have a move of nearly 8% in April on earnings. That 3 for 4 of the stock staying within its expected move makes sense as stocks tend to move with or stay within their earnings expected move about 65-75% of the time. Studies have shown that the number is higher (where the expected move was more than the actual move) when IV is high, and the number is lower, when IV is low. This makes sense as the more move that is expected, the larger the range for a stock to stop in. As far as the visual expected move shown below, this is another useful way to use the expected move, and compare to recent or important levels of support or resistance. In other words, is there more to the expected move's level than just the expected move?  Are there also other technical factors at that level? For instance, JPM's upper expected move of 149.22 is roughly at the same level as the stock's most recent upper range level from Sept 18th. Its bearish expected move of 140.32 is near the stock's 200 day moving average.    Finally, another thing that can be helpful to look at prior to earnings is whether there is heavy open interest at nearby strikes in the stock. In JPM's case that open interest is mostly near the money on the 145 strike and on the upside is at 150. In other words, on a very small 145 could act as a small magnet, and on a move to the upside the open interest on the 150 line could act as resistance.  These are just several factors from the options market that can be helpful going into an earnings event and analyzing risk/reward, strategy, and strike selection on new or existing trades. It's good to have a checklist before selling the move or positioning directionally to get a gut level check of how far the stock could move.  **Trending/Active Today**  * Akero Therapeutics Inc (AKRO) -62.79% * Palantir Technologies Inc Cl A (PLTR) +2.56% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +3.30% * Unity Software Inc (U) +6.16% * 89Bio Inc (ETNB) -33.81% * Pepsico Inc (PEP) +0.77% * Jd.com Inc ADR (JD) +1.88% * Meta Platforms Inc (META) +0.26% * Coherent Corp (COHR) +13.23%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * PepsiCo, Inc.

[Expected moves: A little life in market vol, SPY QQQ VIX Netflix and more,;,; Stock futures are lower for the second straight day. It's a big two days for economic data, following yesterday's Fed minutes. This morning, ADP reported \~500k private sector jobs added, doubling expectations. That sent futures lower as it's yet another sign the FOMC is likely to keep interest rates higher for longer and potentially be more aggressive with raises. The US 2-year treasury yield is above 5% near this year's high, but more importantly, nearing levels it hasn't seen since 2006. Stocks have absorbed higher interest rate assumptions over the past 2 months quite well, rising with the rising yields. That played out mainly due to lessening fears of a recession (and the AI hype driving tech stocks higher). If the jobs number comes in hot tomorrow it will be just the latest data point pointing to a persistently strong economy, driving yields higher, and assumptions of a more hawkish Fed for the balance of 2023. There are signs elsewhere in the economic data of an economy that's cooling off in certain sectors, but jobs and hiring has remained strong, and we'll find out more on the front tomorrow. This 2-day pullback in stocks is breathing a little life into option vol. The VIX is now \~15.30, up from 13 just a few trading days ago.   As was mentioned in this space, vol got about as low as you'd ever see over the past two weeks. That didn't mean it would immediately go higher, but it was unlikely to go much lower. A 15.30 VIX is still historically low but it does show a little appetite for traders to buy options. Something we haven't seen much of over the past several weeks. Skew is near the highest levels of the past few years, meaning downside put strikes were already more expensive than upside call strikes. That is largely reflective of a low IV environment where the percentage differences get magnified, but keep an eye on that skew number as the VIX rises, if it remains high, it would be showing continued demand for puts even at higher vol, and therefore be a good indication of any fear in the market.   With earnings season approaching, it's also interesting to look at how low individual stock IV got and how it's pricing upcoming earnings. Netflix, which reports on the 19th, has 55 IV at the moment for the event, pricing in about an 8% move (that includes all the time leading up to the event as well.) For perspective, in Netflix's last 6 earnings, the stock has moved less than 8% just twice and has had +/-7% moves 5 out of 6 times. In other words, vol is low in most individual stocks as compared o the past 2 years, and with earnings right around the corner, you'll see much smaller expected moves on average (as of now).  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Movers:**     * Tesla Inc (TSLA) -0.44% * Allarity Therapeutics Inc (ALLR) -51.57% * Bioxcel Therapeutics Inc (BTAI) +23.73% * Genius Sports Ltd (GENI) +9.12% * Meta Platforms Inc (META) +1.70% * Lucid Group Inc (LCID) -1.48% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +0.29% * Riot Platforms Inc (RIOT) +3.24% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.16% * Affirm Holdings Inc Cl A (AFRM) -5.06% * Perion Network Ltd (PERI) +7.22%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**     * Levi Strauss &amp; Co.

[Expected moves: VIX pickup, SPY, QQQ Grind lower. Rare Friday Earns from Palo Alto,;,; Stocks are lower again to start Friday. It's been a rough week overall, with the SPY down about 2.5% or so. That's more than double the move options were pricing, and the moves have been a bit more than 0DTE options have been pricing each day. Near-term options are waking up a bit, with 0DTE pricing in expected moves for SPY now out at about 0.7% or so each day, that's up from just 0.4% a few weeks ago. The VIX is now near 19 meaning 30-day vol is back to about its historical average. One interesting data point to add to this is that the SPY itself has not been THAT volatile. It's off a bit more than 5% from its highs, and the recent selling has been a grind lower, not much panic selling. That's not just a *vibe*, the realized vol in SPY for the past 30 days is still just 10. That will likely begin to increase a bit with the past week seeing moves in excess of what options were pricing, but again, the selling has been orderly in the major indices thus far.  Nothing on the economic data front today but next week is the Jackson Hole Conference which takes on some additional significance after this week's more hawkish than expected FOMC minutes as well as what's going on in China's markets.  A rare after-hours on Friday earnings report today from Palo Alto Networks. That may have some traders spooked a bit as it does feel like a Friday news dump (where you'd try to bury bad news when everyone is already away from their desks). However, the last SP 500 company to do the same was Nike in 2020 and that report was good. So who knows. Here's how options are trying to price the event, an odd one as you have to go out to next Friday's options, not today's, to trade options that capture the event:  &amp;#x200B;    The 8% move matches that prior reports actual move of +8%.

[Expected moves: Netflix, Tesla and more.,;,; The second round of big bank earnings are out with Bank of America, PNC and Morgan Stanley reporting this morning. The results have not been market-moving as of yet. MS is unched as of now, with BAC down slightly, both with moves less than options were pricing. PNC is down about 3% vs a 3.5% expected move. So the reactions are pretty muted all things considered. The broader market thinks the same, with futures all red but very slightly. Most of the bank stocks were lower over the past 3 months with the exception of JPM. JPM has also performed the best from the bank stocks that reported last week, initially giving up its earnings move gains but recovering much of them with a strong up day yesterday. Goldman reports tomorrow and then the focus shifts quickly to mega-cap tech after the bell tomorrow with Netflix and Tesla kicking things off.

[Expected moves today, Powell, SPY, VIX,;,; Futures are lower for a 3rd straight day as the market waits for Fed Chair Powell's testimony in front of Congress. Some of his prepared remarks were released before the bell. The 3 day losing streak hasn't added up to much of a sell-off as of yet. The SPY is lower by about 1.5% since an intra-week high last Thursday. Nor has it affected vol much, the VIX is even lower than it was during that Thursday high in stocks.   As mentioned alot recently, yes vol is low, but the moves in the market are also very muted. The realized vol in SPY over the past month now sits at 12. Options in SPY are about 11 vol for the upcoming few weeks. In other words, IV is currently reflective of how the market is moving. Therefore option buyers are still having to get direction correct and be very nimble, despite how "cheap" vol is. Short-term option trading is basically a battle between implied vol, and realized vol. The mean reversion of IV (buying low IV, selling high IV) typically needs more time to play out. Speaking of that, when vol is this low for this long it's sometimes helpful to begin to look out a few months and see how low IV has been dragged down by what's happening recently. A look at SPY vol out in November and December shows at-the-money vol around 15-16. To put that in perspective, that's both below historical averages for IV, but it's also much lower than the realized vol if SPY over the past year, which is around 20, even with the slow grind of the past few months.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Action:**  * Tesla Inc (TSLA) +0.54% * Marathon Digital Hldgs Inc (MARA) +5.38% * Riot Platforms Inc (RIOT) +3.82% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +0.96% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.66% * Coinbase Global Inc Cl A (COIN) +2.89% * Opendoor Technologies Inc (OPEN) +4.23% * Alibaba Group Holding ADR (BABA) -0.65% * Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) +0.24% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.33% * Carvana Company Cl A (CVNA) +0.55% * Li Auto Inc ADR (LI) +3.14% * C3.Ai Inc Cl A (AI) -0.76%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * KB Home (KBH) Expected Move: 7.97% * Winnebago Industries, Inc.

Most, if not all, stock market analysts attempt to predict what a stock or the stock market will do in the future.  They use fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and experience to predict the direction and potential levels to be reached before a potential turning point.  We, on the other hand, analyze what a stock, bond, ETF, or index is unlikely to do in the future based upon its own historical data.  Unlike RSI, Bollinger Bands, or other technical indicators that provide similar information, our measure uses the entire stock/ETF/index trading history to determine what the stock/ETF/index is unlikely to do.    So what is it ??  We have developed a machine learning system that measures a symbols' percentage price change versus time for multiple time periods and compares the symbols recent price behavior to its own past to determine if the current behavior is anomalous.  Think of this as a measure of momentum run amok for the symbol.  Our experience has shown that there are two levels of anomalous stock/ETF/index behavior that are of interest: (1) When the stock/ETF/index current performance is outside of 99% of all prior instances (this is called a Level 1 overbought or oversold condition) and, (2) When the stock/ETF/index current performance is outside the bounds of all of its prior history (this is called a Level 2 overbought or oversold condition).  We currently screen 600 stock/ETF/index symbols every day - with more being added each week.  These symbols are all traded US stock market exchanges during normal US trading hours.  Figure 1, below, shows a subset of symbols screened for March 16, 2023.  [Figure 1.  March 16, 2023 Stock Screener Subset](  In the first column of Figure 1, we have sets of 3 rows that have Level 1, Level 2, and Data Since labels. The Data Since rows describe the start date for each symbol associated with the date. For instance, SPX has 1/2/1962 which means that the machine learning system contains SPX data since January 2, 1962 for the computations of SPX (S&amp;P 500). Likewise, the symbol INDY has data since November 23, 2009 for its computations, etc. Next are the rows for Level 1 and Level 2. Let's look at Level 1 first. In the rows for Level 1, a number greater than or equal to 1 indicates that on a price change % versus time basis, the symbol is overbought because it moved farther to the upside and faster than 99% of all other equivalent time periods in its history. These cells are highlighted light blue in the screener data. In the rows for Level 1, a number less or equal to zero indicates that on a price change % versus time basis, the symbol is oversold because it moved farther to the downside and faster than 99% of all other equivalent time periods in its history. These cells are highlighted light red in the screener data file. Level 2 is similar to Level 1 except that instead of 99% of the history, it is 100% of the history implying the stock/ETF/index has never moved that far that fast for any equivalent period of time in the data set. Yellow highlighted cells simply highlight symbols that are near overbought or oversold on a Level 1 or Level 2 basis.  In Figure 1, we can see that INDY, XLE, USO are screened as Level 1 oversold and XLI, UNG and FCX as almost Level 1 oversold, and META and AGG as overbought.  However, in this article, we are focusing on META which is overbought.  Figure 2, below, shows a chart of the META price action over the last six months.  &amp;#x200B;    So how can we use this information??  The machine learning system that determines the overbought/oversold condition also provides threshold levels that correspond to what the symbol is unlikely to do in the FUTURE based upon where it is trading now.  Table 1, below, shows various levels and limits with different probabilities of occurrence for META for a subset of future dates.  [Table 1.  META Upper and Lower Closing Limits through April 6th, 2023](  In Table 1, above, we show five (5) columns corresponding to "No loss since 2012", "Once Every 10 Years",  "Once Every 5 Years", ‚ÄúOnce Every 1 Year‚Äù, and "1% Raw Data".  Under each column header are sub-headers titled "Lower Limit" and "Upper Limit".  Under each of these sub-headers are prices that reflect what META is unlikely to close below or above for varying probabilities defined the column header.  For instance, in the row corresponding to the 03/24/2023 date, we see a lower limit of 133.52 and upper limit of 287.32 under the No loss since data start column header.  This implies that META closing below 133.52 or above 287.32 on Friday, March 24, 2023 would be historical (something that's never happened before) on a percentage price change versus time basis.  Given that there are approximately 252 trading days every year, once every 10 years  corresponds to a likelihood of 1 in 2520 or 0.039%.  Finally, in the 1% Raw Data column, the prices reflect a 1% probability of closing below the indicated future lower limit prices or above the indicated future upper limit prices on the corresponding date based upon the entire history of META- including what it's done recently.  So who could benefit from this data ??  ‚Ä¢	Options Traders.  The primary beneficiaries of this type of information are options  traders.  By providing closing price levels for a symbol for a given future date, an option trader can write option positions with a known probability of success for both Put and Call options.  ‚Ä¢	Long/short strategies.  Knowing when a stock/ETF/index has moved too far, too fast is an important input in a buying/selling/shorting decision.  This screening decision is done automatically by the machine learning  computers on a daily basis.  The only thing the computer doesn't do is push the buy or sell button for you.  ‚Ä¢	Elliott Wave Practitioners.  Elliott Wave analysis can be a powerful tool for analyzing the likely path a stock/ETF/index may take higher or lower.  However, there are times when multiple paths may present themselves with near equal probability using Elliott Wave analysis alone.  However, many times, one or more possible paths would require the stock/ETF/index to move in a manner that would be unlikely to happen based upon the machine learning analysis.  ‚Ä¢	Fundamentalists.  All traders have two decisions to make:  When to buy and when to sell or vice versa.  A fundamental trader chooses to screen companies based upon fundamental analysis and makes buying decisions based upon this decision.  However, when does the fundamental trader choose to sell, buy more, etc.  The stock screening method explained in this paper can be a useful tool in helping make those decisions with exact price levels.,;,; 2023-03-16 15:37:01]
[How to have $1 million? Start with 1 billion dollars. Buy Meta shares at $378, then sell them at $90, then buy them again at $325 and wait for the next sell-low opportunity.,;,; ,;,; 2023-07-30 19:32:23]
[$META earnings: time to buckle up,;,; Meta Platforms Inc ($ META), formerly known as Facebook, had an impressive Q1 2023 earnings report, beating analysts' expectations and showing strong growth in several key areas. As a result, the company's shares gapped up on Thursday's open to the tune of 15%. It was both a remarkable result and a remarkable response, which bodes well for the tech company as a whole.  How both Google and Apple had done just enough to keep the tech industry buoyant with their earnings beats, but this from Meta is a whole other story. The share price action suggests that the positive momentum could continue in the coming days, so get excited. It's a similar gap to what they experienced at the end of Jan, and it could be looking at the start of another fresh multi-month rally.  ## Smashing Expectations  Digging into the numbers, the company's GAAP EPS came in at $2.20, well ahead of the consensus estimate of $1.97. Meanwhile, the company's revenue of $28.6 billion also beat expectations and showed growth of 2.7% year on year. It wasn't quite the double-digit growth results of yesteryear, but like their tech titan peers yesterday, it will be more than good enough for now.  But the recovery story has been truly one for the ages. Since last November, Meta shares have tacked on 175%, including this morning's jump. And the cherry on top? Well, they're still only barely halfway on their journey to undoing all of last year's selloff.  The past quarter's numbers were driven largely by growth in the company's advertising business, which crushed analyst expectations and surprised investors. Meta's user base also continued to grow, with daily active users (DAUs) reaching 2.04 billion. The company also noted that its efforts to increase ad efficiency had paid off, with the average price per ad increasing by 22% year-on-year. In addition, management saw fit to issue forward guidance that also came in hot, with Looking Ahead  In addition to its advertising business, Meta's other business units also showed strong growth. Looking ahead, Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, highlighted the company's focus on privacy and building a metaverse, a shared virtual space that's expected to be the next big thing in social media. The company is also investing in its messaging platforms, such as WhatsApp and Messenger, to drive further growth and revenue.  Meta strong earnings report is likely to have a positive impact on the broader tech market, particularly other social media companies. Shortly after the market opened on Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 index was up a cool 1.25%, with most commentators thanking Meta for the boost. Those of us on the sidelines know that analysts are remaining bullish on Meta's prospects for the near and medium term. MarketBeat's MarketRank Forecast has a Moderate Buy rating on the stock, based on 40 Buy recommendations out of a total of 49 market ratings.  Some price targets to be kept in mind include the Royal Bank of Canada's $285, Deutsche Bank's $290 and Guggenheim's $320. The latter of these is pointing to an upside of more than 30%, and that's including this morning's jump.  So get excited, both for Meta and tech as a whole. Their strong earnings report is a positive sign for the company and will reinforce those from their peers yesterday.,;,; 2023-04-28 07:16:54]

[My AI momentum trading journey just started. Dumping $3k into an automated trading strategy guided by ChatGPT. Am I gonna make it,;,; As a major lurker, I‚Äôve seen quite a few of these ‚ÄúTrading journey‚Äù posts and I decided that I might as well jump in the fire with my very own take.  The weather is just about brewing with enough chaos that we might see a decent tailwind across AI stocks within the next few months. I intend to ride the hypecycle with a an automated AI strategy to capture as much upside value as possible.  **A few things that make me believe the AI hype cycle is just getting started:**  **The Fed‚Äôning**  * Government expenditure in relation to GDP will continue to increase This isn‚Äôt just a US phenomena, Nation states worldwide are increasing government expediture and reach.(Chipps act, various AI accessibility and regulatory acts). A good portion of this will trickle down into the market cap of bluechip co‚Äôs with big AI departments ready for big ol entreprise contracts.  **The upcoming major IOT adoption via regulatory enforcement**  * On this, I can single out an event that most people are sleeping on. The US food supply chain is about to undergo massive digital transformation with FSMA (The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act ). Think big data lakes and lots of machine learning having to be adopted at gunpoint in unseen rates all across the food supply chain.  **Upstream/Downstream innovation in private markets**  * AI tech has been commoditized, can be forked, API called, build on top of. Its pretty fluid and easy to access. As I type this, there‚Äôs tens of thousands of AI startups across all imaginable industries getting past product-market-fit hurdles, opening distribution channels, and ultimately expanding the AI global total addressable market . This early stage innovation will trickle down into public markets in record time. Wait a few months.  **My AI investment strategy - AI investing in AI (kinda ‚Äúquirky‚Äù huh?)**  To create my strategy I asked an AI tool ‚ÄúCan you create a momentum trading strategy focused on AI-focused stocks?‚Äù     &amp;#x200B;    The AI-created strategy was interesting but I then made some tweaks based on the basket of AI stocks I wanted to include in this momentum trading approach. I removed IBM (as I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be a key beneficiary or leader in the AI race), and added PLTR (for defence/government AI exposure), TSM (for some semiconductor exposure) and META (this is a questionable one but the open source models that their research team have created our world-class and I don‚Äôt want to bet against Zuck).  You can see the final strategy below. One potential concern I have is the max drawdown from the backtests is a little higher than I‚Äôd like but I‚Äôm willing to roll with it this week.

[[Week 2] AI momentum trading journey guided by chat GPT/LLM. Feedback welcome,;,; This is a follow-up on my latest AI trading post where I laid out my short/mid term bullish case on the AI supply chain due to major upcoming disruption driven by policy and private/public markets. Those are:  1. **The Fed‚Äôning:** Major increase in government expenditure in relation to Global GDP that will trickle down into the AI economy. 2. **The upcoming major IOT adoption via regulatory enforcement:** FSMA food traceability act compliance deadline is fast approaching, Chipps Act, etc. 3. **Upstream/Downstream innovation in private markets:** Early stage capital has commoditized AI (APIs, et al.)  with billions of dollars of VC funding. This early stage innovation will trickle down  into public markets sooner that expected.  For those missing initial context, I‚Äôm using AI to invest in AI with automated investing strategies.  **How my AI Momentum Investing strategy is going:**  **The AI portfolio is down slightly from last week (Slowly bouncing back today)**    **I decided to adjust my automated investment strategy midweek (See below)**  ![img](zk5vp690fkeb1 "  ")  1.

[Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY?,;,; A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings:    Data Sources:  * SPY Holdings: [Stock Analysis]( [Schwab]( [Yahoo Finance]( $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST)‚Äã * SFY Holdings: [Stock Analysis]( [Zacks.com]( [Yahoo Finance]( $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST)  **Key Observations:**  * Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. * Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. * Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.  It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.  I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:  1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. 2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&amp;P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. 3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. 4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. 5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. 6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.  It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.  **What are your thoughts?**,;,; 2024-01-24 21:46:21]
[Can we finally admit this market will never go down again in our lifetime,;,; Can people finally admit this market is completely unbreakable/ unstoppable?

To even get QQQ to fall below 400 it would have to fall 7.5 percent? Do you really think this market will ever have that kind of pullback in our lifetime?  The fed thing was just epic. We've known for awhile that rate cuts were not happening fast. People actually think that the market rallies on hopes of rate cuts. It literally doesn't matter if they don't cut rates again all year. This thing will never fall for more than a day or 2 why? Ever single dip is attacked with endless free money. The market doesn't care about price or valuation, it sees that it fell 1% and it's deploying the unlimited liquidity to buy ever dip in sight.   Meta, they announce the smallest dividend and people lose their mind. lol. You can't make this stuff up. 14% rally. Why stop there. This should clearly be worth atleast 5 T.  I'll be called an idiot, I'm sure someone will set a reminder, but every time I make a post you look a month out and this thing is up another 5-7%.  Keep in Mind when QQQ finally hits 500 later this year the drop to 495 will be bought more aggressively than the dip from yesterday.   Every dip will continue to be bought, the market will still rally and there is actually not a single thing that can stop it aside for a few days here and there and guess what it will V and V again forever. All the Mag 7 will have multiple T market caps. I don't care what happened in 2022 or in the past.

For those seeking companies that could positively surprise during the action-packed period, Meta Platforms (META Quick $**META** ) , General Electric ($**GE** ) , and American Air Lines ($**AAL** ) could all be contenders. ¬†  Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.  [ ](  Currently, all three sport a positive Zacks Earnings ESP.  Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) finds companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is more accurate and can better predict the future, providing investors an advantage in earnings season.  **Meta Platforms**  An investor favorite, Meta Platforms, has seen its near-term earnings outlook shift bright over the last several months, landing the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Currently, $META has an Earnings ESP Score of 7.8%, with earnings expected on April 26th.  The company posted a big beat in its latest release, surpassing the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 40% and delivering a 3% sales surprise. Below is a chart illustrating the market‚Äôs reaction to previous quarterly releases.  [ ](  For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $1.96 indicates a pullback within earnings year-over-year. In addition, the company‚Äôs top line is also forecasted to retrace marginally, with the $27.5 billion quarterly estimate indicating a 1.5% Y/Y decline.  [ ](  **American Airlines**  American Airlines‚Äô earnings outlook has improved substantially across all timeframes over the last 60 days, reflecting bullish sentiment among analysts. Currently, AAL has an Earnings ESP Score of 67%, with earnings scheduled to hit on April 27th.  [ ](  The company‚Äôs growth is hard to ignore; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.04 for the quarter to be reported implies an improvement of 100% year-over-year. Further, our consensus revenue estimate stands at $12.3 billion, nearly 40% higher than year-ago quarterly sales of $8.9 billion.  As we can see below, the company‚Äôs revenue has recovered from the pandemic shock, with sales now eclipsing pre-pandemic levels.  [ ](  **General Electric**  Like the stocks above, General Electric has witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, helping push the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). GE currently has an Earnings ESP Score of 10.1%, with earnings expected to drop on April 25th.  The market reacted well to the company‚Äôs latest earnings release, as we can see illustrated in the chart below. General Electric posted earnings of $1.24 per share, reflecting a solid 12% beat. Impressively, the company boasts a 28% four-quarter trailing average EPS beat Regarding the upcoming release, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.13 indicates a decline in earnings from the year-ago quarter. The company‚Äôs top line is forecasted to witness a slowdown also, with the $13.4 billion quarterly estimate implying a decline of roughly 20% year-over-year.   [https:\/\/ 2023-04-19 05:17:40]
[S&amp;P 20 years ago versus today. Via @alerts on IG,;,; **2004:**  1. Walmart   2. ExxonMobil   3. Chevron   4. Citi   5. IBM   6. General Electric   7. GM   8. Ford  **2024:**   1.

Not exactly surprising to see these giants at the top of the list.  The year is 2044... does the top eight look relatively similar to what it looks like now? Feels hard to argue otherwise. Then again they probably said similar things in 2004. It just seems like GAFAM will continue to purchase any successful companies of smaller size. Rarely do we see standalone companies anymore (at least big ones).    ,;,; 2024-02-05 17:33:14]

[Tesla ($TSLA) stock and six other tech titans are responsible for 86% of the S&amp;P 500 2023 performance.,;,;    Tesla($TSLA) stock **plunged nearly 10% last week on earnings**. That caught everyone's attention, but it was just the tip of the iceberg.  0 seconds of 14 secondsVolume 0%   With roughly one-third of the S&amp;P 500 companies **announcing quarterly earnings results this week**, there are none bigger than tech titans **Alphabet** ($**GOOGL**), **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**) and **Meta Platforms** ($META). These four Big Tech stocks alone account for 41% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 year-to-date gain, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.  Adding **Apple** ($**AAPL**), which reports next week, **Nvidia** ($**NVDA**) and **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) stock, Colas says these seven tech giants account for 86% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 gain, which was 7.7% through Monday's close. These seven Big Tech stocks have rallied far more than the S&amp;P 500 this year.  According to Colas, there have been three drivers of outperformance for these tech leaders. First, all seven were deeply oversold at the end of 2022 and received a "January Effect" bounce.  The January Effect is a seasonal increase in stock prices throughout the month of January. The increase in demand for stocks in January is often preceded by a decrease in prices during the month of December, in part due to tax-loss harvesting.     Second, many of these tech companies have been aggressively cutting costs, so earnings power should now be higher than last year. And, finally, interest rates have declined, supporting the valuation of high-multiple stocks, he added.  ## Alphabet, Microsoft Earnings Due  Google-owner Alphabet reports earnings after the closing bell Tuesday. Shares are just below a 106.69 buy point in a **cup with handle**, according to **IBD MarketSmith** chart analysis.  Alphabet earnings are expected to measure $1.08 a share on revenue of $68.8 billion.  Dow Jones software giant Microsoft slid almost 2% midday Tuesday, threatening to extend a losing streak to four sessions ahead of the company's earnings results late Tuesday. MSFT stock is rolling back toward a 276.86 buy point in a **flat base** following a March 17 breakout.  Wall Street expects Microsoft to earn $2.24 a share on revenue of $51.0 billion, per FactSet estimates.     ## Amazon, Meta Earnings Also On Deck  E-commerce giant Amazon continues to trace the right side of a **cup base**, but is seeing resistance around its long-term 200-day moving average.  With earnings due out late Thursday, Amazon is expected to earn 21 cents a share on sales of $124.5 billion.  Facebook parent Meta Platforms will report Wednesday after the stock market closes. Meta stock is out of buy range past a **197.26 buy point** in a flat base, but receding.  The social media giant is expected to earn $2.02 a share on revenue of $27.6 billion.  ## Apple Earnings Next Week  Apple shares reversed squarely lower midday Tuesday. Still, they remain solidly above a 157.48 buy point and at the top of the **5% buy range** that runs up to 165.35.  The Dow Jones tech giant reports its fiscal second-quarter results on May 4. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to earn $1.43 a share on sales of $92.9 billion.     ## Nvidia Holds Up; Tesla Stock Breaks Down  Graphics-chip maker Nvidia remains near its recent highs despite sharp losses midday Tuesday. Shares declined more than 2% in afternoon trade.  The **IBD Leaderboard stock** broke out past a 230.59 handle buy point after the **company's strong earnings on Feb. 23**.  Electric-vehicle giant Tesla stock continues to trade near its lowest level since Jan. 26. In recent weeks, shares triggered the **7%-8% loss rule** from a buy point at 200.76 in a cup with handle. And they are trading sharply below their 50-day line, a key level.,;,; 2023-04-26 06:14:46]

[Selling AAPL, looking for assessments of OLN, ZS and WELL,;,; Anyone have thoughts on Olin, Zscaler or Welltower? Looking to reallocate about 20% of my portfolio that is currently invested in APPL. Would also love to hear any picks for small or mid cap companies with really good growth potential as the bulk of my portfolio is pretty balanced. The assets I have in Apple are earmarked for a more risky, higher growth allocation. Since i'm sure people would think i'm crazy to sell APPL, I have a rule not to invest in any companies working on or involved in accelerating the push for generative AI(MSFT, GOOG, META, NVDA).

[Is Apple Honestly Bearish Now?,;,; $AAPL on a weekly closing basis needs to close above $190 to break a (2) consecutive 5 WEEK rolling negative return...you think it's not a big deal...sure...maybe not but it has been POSITIVE SINCE JANUARY 13th, 2023 (a great time to buy)  &amp;#x200B;    This was the end of the bottom. Because that was the last week of (2) consecutive weeks of 5 WEEK Rolling negative return.  &amp;#x200B;    Here is the data from the weekly...if you want to be nit-picky...you could look at the 1/27/23 and say it was the time to actually go LONG but whatever.  What's important now is that if we close below $190 for APPLE this week...it will be (2 consecutive) weeks starting of negative returns. That's a highly correlated sign to negative returns going forward.  If it's flips to negative...is it time to sell?  The concern with Apple isn't even the change in sentiment. It's the size.  Every single money manager on the planet pays attention to Apple. Most own it, most mutual funds, etfs and sovereign wealth funds own it.  Apple is a safe bet or has been for years. Now things suddenly go south after earnings....fishy.  The environment for Apple's massive growth has changed.  I don't want to ramble but it's important to look at Apple if sentiment changes and boy did thins change.  What do you think? Can this make it? Will this be a reversal this week and we close above $190?  EDIT:  I didn‚Äôt say APPLE üçé was going to zero. I‚Äôm saying the price action has changed for now. It‚Äôs pretty obvious and this isn‚Äôt fundamental research. I get it. But the market is acting different for a reason.,;,; 2023-08-08 02:20:19]
[What Walmart‚Äôs ($WMT) stock split means for the Dow Jones.,;,; Walmart recently announced a 3 for 1 stock split, a significant move considering its status as a major component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Since the Dow is a price-weighted index, this split will decrease Walmart‚Äôs weighting in the index, initiating a rebalance to accommodate the drop in price.  It's intriguing to note that the Dow has been trailing behind the S&amp;P 500 in performance YTD, increasing ~2.6% and ~5.4% respectively.   Potentially prompting the index to consider adding new stocks to compensate for the YTD underperformance.  The last time the Dow underwent a significant change was in August 2020. At that time, Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell were added, while Exxon, Pfizer, and RTX Corp were removed.  Unlike their usual practices, the Dow committee has delayed making changes for an extended period of time, reminiscent of the period from June 2009 to September 2012.  With the Dow undergoing rebalancing, I‚Äôm eyeing potential exits for IBM, Cisco, Intel, Verizon, and Walgreens Boots Alliance.    Additionally, I could see potential additions like Amazon, META, and Eli Lilly who have a wider touch on the economy.  Which stocks do you predict might be on the way out, and which new additions do you foresee?,;,; 2024-02-09 15:02:01]
[Zoominfo: Q4 Results and Dampened 2023 Outlook. Is Management being Conservative?,;,; Zoominfo (ZI -1.43%‚Üì) Q4 2022 revenue topped $300mn and registered an annual growth rate of 36%. Adjusted operating income margins exceeded 40%, which puts Zoominfo in a rare category of meaningful profitability among higher-growth technology companies. But the key issue with last evening‚Äôs financial report had to do with its outlook: 2023 is only projected to grow at high teens. Not bad for any company to be forecasting double digit growth in a recessionary environment, but expectations for Zoominfo had been higher, especially in the light of historical performance.  &amp;#x200B;  Key Highlights from Q4 2022 Report  &amp;#x200B;  The technology sector has been laying off employees since early-to-mid 2022 to reduce overheads and prepare for potentially weaker business volumes. Even giants like Salesforce (CRM -2.15%‚Üì) and Meta (META -2.25%‚Üì) could not avoid the fate as recessionary pressures continued unabated and markets demanded to see higher profitability.  &amp;#x200B;  With 40% of its customer base originating from the software vertical and a largely seat-base revenue model, Zoominfo faced increasingly stacked odds in 2022. While it had enjoyed extraordinary growth in tandem with prevalent hiring in the technology sector back in 2021, those tailwinds recently turned into headwinds. Trying to retain accounts and win new ones when customers (exiting and potential) were retrenching became a tall order.,;,; 2023-03-10 00:24:59]

[Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&amp;P 500 gains,;,; = just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing =  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023  [  &amp;#x200B;  The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&amp;P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.  &amp;#x200B;  It‚Äôs an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inflation battle, noted FactSet‚Äôs Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 top performing days for the S&amp;P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday‚Äôs close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%.  &amp;#x200B;  Through Dec. 22, the S&amp;P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&amp;P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.  &amp;#x200B;  Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&amp;P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  That didn‚Äôt mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.  &amp;#x200B;  Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.  &amp;#x200B;  Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.  &amp;#x200B;  The strategy ‚Äúindicates the Fed‚Äôs measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,‚Äù Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&amp;P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks‚Äô bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group‚Äôs announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.  &amp;#x200B;  SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a ‚Äúmini‚Äù banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.  &amp;#x200B;  Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks ‚Äî Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com]( Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%,  and Meta Platforms Inc.  META, 0.56%.  &amp;#x200B;  See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?  &amp;#x200B;  Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high:  &amp;#x200B;  The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs overall return, he wrote, with the company‚Äôs success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.,;,; 2023-12-27 15:52:27]

[Short-term vs long-term cap gains abd the impossibility of timing the market,;,; My first post here‚Äîapologies if this post would be better situated elsewhere.

Occidental Petroleum (OXY.N): Q4 2022 revenue increased approximately 4% year-over-year to $8.326 billion and net income increased 27% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. The company announced a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization and raised its quarterly dividend by 38% to $0.18 per share.

Zoom (ZM.O): FY2023 Q4 revenue up 4% YoY to $1.12B, net loss of $104M, first net loss since 2018; better than expected FY2024 EPS guidance of $4.11-$4.18.

[Will Big Tech Slow Down At All? Why/How?,;,; I've got 9/15 $35 SQQQ Calls but I'm getting worried because big tech seems like a force of nature esp with the emergence of AI, it's like they're all on fucking steroids and a correction may be a tiny 5% pullback before it explodes into the stratosphere.  About a month or two ago I was fairly confident in a recession happening, but recently with new data coming out, it seems like there ain't gonna be a recession.   Strong labor market, inflation still sticky but it seems like a pause in June is certain which might mean there wont be any more rate hikes this year, and it seems like people who once thought a recession was coming in the 2nd half of the year and now saying either there ain't a recession coming or the odds of a recession are significantly lower than they use to be.  This is pure speculation but with the emergence of AI it feels like the magnificent 7 (MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, GOOG, META, NVDA, TSLA) is going to absolutely smash their next earnings calls in late July.   I'm really just looking for opinions on how and why big tech will see a decently sized correction in the near future because the way things look now, it's hard to fathom a big tech EVER slowing down.,;,; 2023-06-06 01:03:44]

[Peg Ratio,;,; Do you think a stock with a peg ratio lower than 2 is a good investment? I know that historically the best bargains are stocks which peg ratio are 1 or lower. However, I‚Äô ve noticed many of the big companies have peg closer to 2 or more than 2   examples: Microsoft: 2.61, Google: 1.72, Meta:1,58 , etc  So, in order for their peg to be 1 or lower all these stocks pe ratios should fall between 13-16 and to be honest I don‚Äôt see that happening any time soon(I even think these stocks will keep a P/E ratio of at least 25 or 30 the next 3-5 years )  So do you think a peg ratio between 1 and 2 would be a better reference than the peg of 1 or lower ? Most of the stock I‚Äôve reviewed seems to have pe ratios that double their growth rate If the stock projected growth rate is 10 it‚Äôs P/E ratio is close to  the 20s , if the expected growth is 15 the p/ e ratio is close to the 30s and so on. I think even the sp500 had a pe ratio of 20 when it delivered a 10% return last years(not sure about this one) But to me, it seems like that pe ratio would double the projected growth in most of the cases   Of course I might be totally wrong , so I appreciate any comments regarding this topic   Thank you so much for your time and help ;),;,; 2023-11-05 14:57:02]
[Stock Market Today (as of Mar 15, 2023),;,; Last night, the three major US stock indexes fluctuated and closed higher, with regional banks rebounding and semiconductors leading the market. At the close, the Dow Jones rose 1.06%, the Nasdaq rose 2.14%, and the S&amp;P rose 1.65%.  The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds rose 3.754% to close at 3.676%, with a spread of -56 basis points compared to the yield on 2-year Treasury bonds. The VIX fell 10.52%, Brent crude oil fell 3.78%, and spot gold has been on an upward trend since November 2022, but it fell 0.51% yesterday to $1903.8/ounce. The US dollar index continued to fall from its high, closing at 103.67.  The US CPI has risen steadily in February due to the high cost of rent, with a month-on-month increase of 0.4% and a year-on-year increase of 6.0%, which is in line with expectations. There is uncertainty among economists as to whether the increase in inflation will be enough to push the Fed to raise interest rates again next week, especially after the bankruptcy of two regional banks. Some economists, including Goldman Sachs, predict that the Fed will pause the current fast monetary policy tightening cycle since the 1980s to avoid the spread of the banking crisis, while financial markets still expect the Fed to raise interest rates by 25 basis points. CME's "Fed Watch" reflects the mixed opinions among economists regarding the Fed's next move.  The Wall Street Journal reports that the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating Silicon Valley Bank's information disclosure and executive trading. Signature Bank is being sued for providing false statements to customers, and a proposed class-action lawsuit aims to obtain compensation from the bank. Moody's has stated that the operating environment for the US banking system is quickly deteriorating, with a negative outlook.  The US military has accused a Russian fighter jet of intercepting and destroying a US drone in the Black Sea. The US government has notified its allies and is in direct communication with Russian officials to express its opposition to the incident. The Russian ambassador to the US has been called in for discussions. The Russian side denies the allegations and claims that the drone was not deliberately targeted and lost control due to a sudden maneuver.  **Trending Stocks**  [**First Republic Bank(FRC)**](  &amp;#x200B;    FRC, which was down 61.83% on Monday, was up nearly 28% yesterday, and traded up another 8.45% in the post-market.

[Dow Jones rises but leaders tumble, and Tesla ($TSLA) stock triggers the sell rule.,;,;  Dow Jones futures were little changed early Thursday, along with S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The stock market rally struggled Wednesday as weak economic data raised recession fears for a second straight session.    The major indexes still don't look too bad, with the Nasdaq sliding but the Dow Jones rising.  But once again, declining stocks decisively beat winners. Once again, many of those losers fell hard. But on Wednesday, a lot of more of those big losers were leading stocks, such as **On Holding** ($**ONON**), **MarketAxess** ($**MKTX**) and **PagerDuty** ($**PD**). **C3.ai** ($**AI**) sold off for a second session, with the AI stock now staging a massive, outside week to the downside.  Others, including many chip names, declined solidly, now showing more chart damage after relatively modest retreats Tuesday.  **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) skidded for a third straight day, triggering the automatic sell rule.   Megacap techs such as **Apple** ($**AAPL**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**), Google parent **Alphabet** (**GOOGL**), **Meta Platforms** ($**META**) and **Nvidia** all fell.  Meanwhile, bank stocks came under more pressure. **Western Alliance Bancorp** (**WAL**) plunged, leading a retreat in regional banks, though they pared losses in the afternoon. **Charles Schwab**hit a two-year closing low. While bank deposits may be relatively safe, the bigger issue now may be long-term bank profitability as well as lending curbs that rapidly slow the economy.  Medical names are looking relatively strong, along with other defensive growth or defensive plays.  PagerDuty stock, On Holding, Meta and Nvidia are on **IBD Leaderboard**. Microsoft and Google stock are on the **IBD Long-Term Leaders** list.   Despite relatively benign action in the major indexes, the weakness in growth and other leading stocks is concerning. Investors should be looking to protect profits and cut losses.  ## Costco Sales Weak  Costco same-store sales fell 1.1% in March vs. a year earlier, the first decline in nearly three years. U.S. comps slid 1.5%. Excluding gasoline and currency effects, comps rose 2.6% or 0.9% in the U.S. E-commerce comps tumbled 11.6%. COST stock fell modestly.  ## Dow Jones Futures Today  Dow Jones futures edged higher vs. fair value. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.2%.  The Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. That follows unexpectedly weak February job openings and the March ADP Employment Report. Labor will release the March jobs report on Friday morning, but U.S. markets will be closed.   ## Stock Market Rally  The stock market rally had a generally negative session, despite the mixed action on the major indexes.  The ADP Employment Report showed private payrolls rose much less than expected in March, a day after a big drop in February job openings. The March ISM services index fell more than expected, signaling rapidly slowing growth.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% in Wednesday's **stock market trading**. The S&amp;P 500 index dipped 0.25%. The Nasdaq composite retreated 1.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 1%.  U.S. crude oil prices dipped 0.1% to $80.61 a barrel.  The 10-year Treasury yield declined 5 basis points to 3.285%. That's the lowest point in nearly seven months. The 2-year Treasury yield sank 7 basis points to 3.76%, off 34 basis points in the past four sessions.  ## ETFs  Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ($**FFTY**) shed 1.9%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ($**BOUT**) gave up 0.65%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ($**IGV**) slipped 1.3%. Microsoft stock and a few other heavyweights dominate IGV, while more-speculative software names like PagerDuty suffered bigger losses. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([**SMH**]( gave up 1.75%, with NVDA stock a major holding.  Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF ($**ARKK**) slumped 3.6% and ARK Genomics ETF (**ARKG**) shed 1.8%. TSLA stock is the top holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. Some Ark funds also own PD stock.  SPDR S&amp;P Metals &amp; Mining ETF (**XME**) retreated 1.15% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (**PAVE**) 1.7%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (**JETS**) and SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (**XHB**) descended 1.5%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (**XLE**) climbed 1.5% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (**XLV**) rallied 1.7% to its best level since Feb. 14.  ## Bank Stocks  The Financial Select SPDR ETF (**XLF**) edged down 0.1%, with SCHW stock a top 10 holding. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (**KRE**), which includes WAL stock, sank 1% but finished off lows.  Western Alliance stock plunged as much as 19.4% after releasing some financial metrics but not disclosing deposits. Shares came off their lows as the California-based bank disclosed deposits fell 11% on March 31 vs. the end of 2022, not as bad as some feared. Still, WAL stock closed down 12.4%.,;,; 2023-04-06 11:23:50]

[Morning Brief from a Certified Market Technician 5/23/23 9:05 am EST,;,; Yesterday, the markets experienced notable volatility, albeit within a relatively narrow range. Risk sentiment seemed to be in favor, as small and micro-cap stocks demonstrated strong outperformance. On the other hand, mega-caps played their part in boosting the Nasdaq higher, with META leading the charge despite being hit with a record-breaking fine from the EU. Nonetheless, the lingering concern over debt ceiling talks continued to exert pressure on stocks, as yesterday's discussions failed to yield any significant results.  In after-hours trading last night, the markets initially displayed positive momentum but retraced during the pre-market session this morning before gradually clawing their way back up. Small caps, as represented by the IWM, have been outperforming their larger counterparts and currently stand as the sole index in the green this morning. However, all major sectors are presently in the red, save for energy, which stands out with a noteworthy gain of nearly 1% as crude oil prices advance.  Given the prevailing market environment, we should anticipate further volatility throughout the day. The market remains highly responsive to news events, with the release of crucial PMI data scheduled for 9:45 AM and ongoing updates regarding the debt talks likely to capture attention throughout the day.

[What happened to $TSLA this week?,;,; Welcome my weekly $TSLA update.  &amp;#x200B;  **1)** **Volkswagen confirms talks with Tesla over NACS charging standard.**  Volkswagen is considering using Tesla's charging connector for its electric vehicles in North America, potentially joining Tesla's North American Charging Standard (NACS). The company is currently in talks with Tesla about adopting this connector for its Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, and future Scout brands in the region.  **2)** **Tesla set for record quarter in China.**  Analysts predict that Tesla is likely to achieve a new sales record in China despite competition from local rivals. Estimates suggest Tesla could sell around 155,000 cars in China from April to June, marking a 13% increase from the previous quarter, although its market share may decline slightly due to increased competition from companies like BYD and Aion.  **3) Tesla sales forecast for Q2: 440,000-450,000 deliveries.**  As the second quarter comes to a close, Tesla remains the dominant force in the electric vehicle market, with estimated sales forecasts for Q2 ranging from 441,000 to 448,000 vehicles. The Model Y is expected to outpace other models, and while Tesla's production is increasing, concerns arise regarding the gap between production and deliveries. The upcoming release of the Cybertruck and a lower-cost Tesla model are seen as crucial for sustaining Tesla's growth.  **4)** **Elon vs. Zuck: it's officially happening.**  Tech billionaires Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have engaged in social media banter about a potential cage fight between them, generating publicity and attention. However, it remains uncertain whether the fight will actually take place, and some speculate that the discussion may serve as a distraction from recent negative news surrounding Meta's decision to cut off news access in Canada and Musk's declining reputation--according to data from Morning Consult.  &amp;#x200B;  **PS:** links + update in your inbox every week, [here]( 2023-06-29 22:24:05]

[ChatGPT picks a winning stock portfolio and easily beats top-performing funds.,;,;    A fictional stock portfolio curated by ChatGPT has put the Top 10 U.K. funds to shame.   ChatGPT was instructed to assemble a winning stock portfolio. The AI replied that it couldn‚Äôt provide specific investment guidance, but when Finder clarified the exercise was purely theoretical, ChatGPT played ball and gathered 38 stocks to form a fund that did strong numbers in the eight weeks following its creation on March 6, 2023. It outperformed the UK‚Äôs top 10 funds‚Äô average gains in the same time period.  ‚ÄúThe ChatGPT fund has led the real funds for 34 of the 37 market days (87%) of its lifespan so far,‚Äù Finder reported. On April 4, ChatGPT was up 4.7%, while the real funds were left in the dust, down by 1.9%. The top performers of the experimental AI fund (thus far) are Meta, Microsoft, and Intel, all of which are up double-digit percents.     ‚ÄúBig funds have increasingly been using AI for years, but the public using a rudimentary AI platform that openly says its data is patchy since September 2021 and lacks the intricacies of market psychology, doesn‚Äôt sound like a good idea,‚Äù said Finder CEO Jon Ostler.  When surveyed by Censuswide (commissioned by Finder), U.K. respondents offered a glimpse into their comfort level with AI in the personal finance world. Eight percent of surveyed adults indicated they‚Äôd already used AI to get financial advice, while 19% said they‚Äôd consider letting ChatGPT give them financial advice.  This once again highlights the gap between how companies view ChatGPT and how civilians look at the tool. While the average person may see it as an amusement, research assistant, or in-house financial adviser, major companies such as Samsung view it as a security risk of the highest order, hence the aforementioned tech corporation‚Äôs flat-out ban on employees using generative AI for work purposes.

[Why US &amp; Global Market is suddenly green?,;,; Maybe don‚Äôt rejoice with more calls just yet. This could be a momentary green blip in my humble understanding for following reasons:   1) US CPI data was relatively good. if not good something that market believes can be used as a reason for not having a rate hike on 22 March Fed Meet. Fed usually looks at Core Inflation but I believe market in general is thinking: you know what Fed can say with what‚Äôs happened at SVB, Signature, etc and fallout from that to be seen on CPI and Jobs report etc BS and overall inflation in the expected range we can take it slow for this month being prudent. Remember Fed likes to save not cause market events.   2) Market was baking in collapse of some more US regional banks and severe pressure on Credit Suisse (Swiss). Both fears have been allayed for time being. No bank run happened on Monday and none is probable today making market think the Fed and Treasury announcement has helped.   3) To those who would say why are we talking about US markets when thinking of Global Markets - well nothing changed Globally from Thursday last week yet we saw almost all Markets pricing in some major event. Any guesses ? SVB / Signature/ US market! Heck if anything markets other than US have been reporting positive events.   4) Where things would become interesting is as we approach 22 March. If Fed rate hike comes in at 50bps one part of the market will be fearful for more bank collapses in USA. If rate hike doesn‚Äôt come the Inflation camp is going to smell this as a threat to economic sustainability and merge that with ‚ÄúAll money is insured‚Äù rhetoric of US Govt creating a scenario with narrative being something like: More money printed - Insuring heavily discounted bonds to 100% is excess money printing in short term, inflation unchecked, Common Man affected, Consumption is going to take a toll in coming months, economy is going to be out of control of Fed, so all is doomed.  *Bonus: Where will the next red blip come from. Well could come from anywhere but I think with SVB and Signature getting out of play a lot of startups - starving for funding- will get the right of passage to raise a white flag. This will in my humble opinion cause a revenue shock for Commercial RE, Hosting Service Providers (think Shopify, AWS, Azure, Google, etc), and Digital/ SMM marketing services like Meta, Twitter, Snap, Google, Amazon, etc among other key big ticket vendors on startups list of expenses. *,;,; 2023-03-14 14:45:43]

[Earnings wave, Credit Suisse ($CSGN) outflows, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond ($BBBY) bankruptcy‚Äîwhat's moving markets?,;,; U.S. futures point lower as investors look ahead to a wave of massive corporate earnings this week. Credit Suisse suffers significant first quarter outflows, underlining the challenges surrounding its shotgun marriage with rival UBS, while NBCUniversal's CEO resigns and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond files for bankruptcy.  **1. Futures drop as earnings season kicks into full gear**  High-profile corporate names, including some of the world's biggest technology groups, will unveil their latest results this week as concerns persist over a possible slowdown in the U.S. economy.  Companies faced a tumultuous quarter highlighted by stubbornly elevated (but easing) inflation, widespread tech sector layoffs, and the banking crisis.  Google-parent Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN), and Facebook-owned Meta Platforms, Inc. ($META) are all slated to report, along with chip-making giant Intel ($INTC). Consumer goods firm Mondelez International, Inc. ($MDLZ), oil major ExxonMobil Corp. ($XOM), payments processor Mastercard Inc. ($MA), drinks maker Coca-Cola Company ($KO) and drugmaker Eli Lilly and Company ($LLY) are also among the hundreds of businesses due to release their earnings in the coming days.  Last week, JPMorgan ($JPM) chief Jamie Dimon flagged looming economic "storm clouds" on the horizon, adding that the banking industry's recent issues have only exacerbated these fears. However, these worries were somewhat tempered by separate data on Friday which showed that business activity in the U.S. touched an 11-month high in April.  **2.** **Credit Suisse's 'alarming' results**  Credit Suisse ($CSGN) saw CHF 61.2 billion in asset outflows in the first quarter in what is likely to be the final earnings report from the Swiss lender after its merger with rival UBS Group AG ($UBSG).  The bank called the outflows "significant," adding that they have moderated but not yet reversed.  It said that withdrawals of cash deposits and non-renewal of maturing time deposits were most acute in the days preceding and following the announcement of the tie-up last month. Swiss officials brokered the deal to bolster confidence in the country's banking system in the wake of turmoil across the global financial services sector sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.  Customer deposits also declined by CHF 67B in the opening three months of its 2023 fiscal year.  The results, which analysts at KBW called "alarming," set the stage for quarterly figures from UBS due out tomorrow, with investors keen to find out more about how it plans to fold Credit Suisse into its operations.  "UBS undoubtedly faces a major (and urgent) task in deeply restructuring its former competitor," analysts at Vontobel said in a note on Monday.  **3. NBCUniversal CEO to step down**  NBCUniversal chief Jeff Shell will leave following an investigation reportedly led by an outside counsel into a complaint over inappropriate behavior, the media giant's parent Comcast Corp. ($CMCSA) announced in a note to staff.  In a statement, Shell said he had had an "inappropriate relationship" with a female employee. The woman is believed to be a long-time journalist for the company, according to multiple media reports.  "Today is my last day as CEO of NBCUniversal," Shell said on Sunday. The executive, who is married, added that he deeply regretted the relationship.  Shell's departure comes as a precarious time for NBCUniversal. He had been leading a charge to refocus on the firm's operations as it faced increased competition from streaming rivals.  Senior leaders who had been working under Shell will now report to Comcast president Mike Cavanagh, the note said.  **4. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond files for bankruptcy**  U.S. home goods retailer Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. ($BBBY) has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a New Jersey court after it failed to secure funds needed to continue as a going concern.  The embattled business had attempted to stay afloat through a complex sale of preferred stock and warrants that aimed to raise $1B. However, that deal was scrapped last month, leading the company to announce a last-ditch effort to garner $300 million from investors.  But neither this fundraising drive nor a series of store closures have proven to be enough. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is now expected to use the bankruptcy proceedings to give it time to conduct a liquidation of some or most of its assets. Individual shareholders will likely be wiped out in the process.  Should a bidder for the business come forward, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond said it would pursue a sale and move away from liquidation.  The retail chain, which was once a hugely popular staple of suburban American life, had previously tried to overhaul its operations to combat flagging demand for its privately branded products. This push ultimately proved unfruitful with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond posting a loss of about $393M and a 33% fall in sales in the quarter ended on November 26.  **5. Oil slips amid broader economic fears**  Oil prices dropped, extending their recent decline into this week, as traders eyed a darkening outlook for global demand.  Concerns remain that rising interest rates will lead to a broader economic slowdown, particularly in the U.S. economy, the world's biggest consumer of crude.  By 04:17 EST (08:17 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.51% lower at $77.47 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell by 0.56% to $81.00 per barrel.  Last week, crude markets slumped to their first weekly loss in five, after data showed that the U.S. implied gasoline demand dropped by 3.9% compared to the same period last year.,;,; 2023-04-25 09:35:25]

[The tech industry's resilience: no signs of earnings recession despite market volatility,;,;  Last week, big U.S. tech companies began reporting their earnings for the first quarter of 2023. The results were generally ahead of estimates; for example, Alphabet revealed that its revenue grew, and that its rate of decline in earnings slowed down. Meta Platforms and others also put out earnings that were well ahead of expectations.  The results seen from U.S. tech companies last week call into question the narrative that we are in the midst of an ‚Äúearnings recession.‚Äù This year, analysts have been busy cutting corporate earnings estimates because of a belief that earnings will decline due to a poor economy. The actual results posted suggest otherwise. Most of the U.S. tech companies are posting positive revenue growth; a few are even growing their earnings.  ## Microsoft beats earnings  **Microsoft ($MSFT)** was a big winner in last week‚Äôs U.S. earnings bonanza. It not only beat expectations but also delivered positive growth in net income, which most of its peers were not able to do. In the first quarter (Q1), MSFT delivered the following:  * $52.86 billion in revenue, up 7% * $22.35 billion in operating income, up 9.7% * $18.3 billion in earnings, up 9.4% * $2.45 in diluted earnings per share (EPS), up 10.3% * A 34.92% profit margin  Overall, it was a very strong quarter. Microsoft easily beat estimates on both revenue and profit, and it guided for further strength in the second quarter. If Microsoft‚Äôs results are any indication, then Canadian tech companies might put out good earnings when they report this week.  ## What‚Äôs next for Canadian stocks?  This week, Canadian tech companies will begin reporting their first-quarter earnings. These releases will show investors whether the companies in question are growing, profitable, and, overall, worth investing in.  **Shopify ($SHOP)** is one Canadian tech stock that will be reporting soon. Its release comes out on May 4 ‚Äî the same day that Apple releases its earnings. Most likely, SHOP‚Äôs release will be overshadowed by Apple‚Äôs more closely watched earnings, but it will be notable in many ways itself.  For one thing, investors will want to know whether Shopify can keep up its high revenue growth. In 2022, Shopify‚Äôs revenue growth decelerated considerably, falling into the low teens. In the fourth quarter, it picked up a little, reaching 26%. Revenue deceleration has been a concern for Shopify, which was previously growing outrageously quickly (sales increased 86% in 2020), but lost its growth in 2022. If revenue growth picks up again, particularly if it exceeds the rate of growth analysts expect, then SHOP stock will likely rally.  Another thing investors will be watching in Shopify‚Äôs first-quarter earnings release is its profitability. Shopify was not profitable last quarter, partially because of losses on its stock portfolio. However, now, with tech stocks rising, Shopify may be able to become profitable again. It already has positive gross profit, but it‚Äôs suffering from the earnings impact of a weak stock market. There is a decent chance that Shopify will turn profitable in Q1, but it‚Äôs not guaranteed. Therefore, it‚Äôs something that investors will want to watch closely in SHOP‚Äôs Q1 earnings release.,;,; 2023-05-02 10:36:47]

[(3/16) Thursday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,;,; #Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, March the 16th, 2023-  *****  # [Dow futures slip, regional bank shares drop: Live updates](  ***** &gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Thursday as regional banks slid once again on growing fears of a crisis in banking within the U.S. and Europe. ***** &gt; Futures tied to the 30-stock index were down 94 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures were down 0.2%, while Nasdaq-100 futures traded up 0.3%. ***** &gt; Credit Suisse announced overnight it will borrow up to nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank to assure short-term liquidity. That offered some relief to the embattled bank in extended hours after it fell to a record low Wednesday following reports that the Saudi National Bank, Credit Suisse‚Äôs largest investor, said it would not provide additional assistance. U.S.-listed shares gained 5% in extended trading after falling just under 14% in the prior session. ***** &gt; But the news was not enough to quell fears on Wall Street of an impending crisis, leading regional banks to take another leg down in Thursday‚Äôs premarket. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) slid 2.6% in extended trading, led down by a more than 26% drop in First Republic Bank. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs also similar to ‚Äô08 is the hunting in the market for who‚Äôs the most weak next,‚Äù said Greg Fleming, CEO of Rockefeller Capital Management and former president of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd the proxy‚Äôs been uninsured deposits.‚Äù ***** &gt; Growing concern over Credit Suisse sent other European banking stocks lower and reverberated in U.S. markets beginning Wednesday. The Dow at one point Wednesday fell 725 points before ending the day down by 280.83 points, or 0.87% lower. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.7%. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no doubt changing the landscape of how we as investors look at the investability of financial institutions that fit in the banking sector,‚Äù said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. ‚ÄúIt also makes us ponder just how the sector would navigate with, in the future, more forms of regulatory pressure on these corporations.‚Äù ***** &gt; Traders will keep an eye out for key economic data, including the latest jobless claims report.

[Investment plan for about 85 000$ USD over the coming year,;,; So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years.  I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030.  However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.  I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.  The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)  Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco **S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&amp;P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)  So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?  Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :),;,; 2023-07-17 13:28:09]

[The Week Ahead: Technical Analysis of SPY QQQ IWM,;,; **OVERALL**:  SPY showing the weakest chart with a potential breakdown back inside the bear channel.  IWM closed right at its bear channel ceiling, so Monday's candle could lead it into a potential breakdown as  well.  QQQ holding up the best, with at least a minor support level between current price &amp; its bear channel.  With prices sitting within so much support, probabilities would favor a bounce Monday; however, the regional bank sector crisis throws probabilities out the window.  We'll see...  &amp;#x200B;  **SPY**:  Potential breakdown back inside the bear channel; the prices to watch are a close below 384.32 -- or -- a close above 389.30 -- that will officially determine the breakdown (or not).  If a breakdown, major resistance is the 368.79 level of convergence between double bottom and COVID ascending TL.  If not a breakdown, then major resistance would be around 423.50 as price would be moving within a bullish parallel channel.    **QQQ**:  Price closed below the 50 + 200 DMA necktie, but just above 283.98 convergence of 100 DMA and ascending TL off the Oct 2022 lows; probabilities suggest this level will need to be tagged and therefore could see more downside early next week to hit this level.  Major support remains down at 270 former bear channel ceiling; aforementioned levels are just minor support.  First resistnace is 301.70 descending TL from the early Feb 2023 pivot high.  Major resistance is now 334.42 (now longer the 311 triple top) as the down move we are seeing could technically be all inside bar, bullish consolidation from the Dec 2022 to Feb 2023 up move.  The bull case is unlikely, given the events of this past week, but nevertheless worth mentioning because the chart is the chart, after all.    **IWM**: Price fell &amp; closed into major support; probabilities would suggest a multi-day/week bounce from this level, ***but*** the SVB collapse, &amp; weakness across the entire regional banking sector as a result, certainly cannot be ignored.  If downside continues, 170 should provide some support, but the next major level is 162.76 - 160.40 where triple bottom &amp; an ascending long term TL converge.  Any bounce would see first resistance at 181.45 (gap-fill and 200 DMA), as well as 187 -- major resistance is 197 - 202 (ascending long term TL and double top).    &amp;#x200B;  I will play a lot of catch up here since it's been over a month since my posting (work &amp; life have a tendency to do that).

[Booking Holdings stock analysis (Burry's 4th Largest Holding),;,; Hi everyone, I hope you are all well. I want to share my thoughts on Booking as a company since I think Booking is interesting. If you're looking for a superficial analysis and don't like reading, look elsewhere. This isn't a superficial analysis, which is what is typically shared. I'll share why I think Booking might be differentiated from major competitors like Expedia and AirBnb. I'll also do an overview of the economics of the business, then write about the industry and competitors and estimate the intrinsic value. As I am sure all of you know, this is just my thoughts so please do your own research. I hope I provide some insights and I welcome an exchange of ideas.  # Company Overview:  Booking is an online travel agency (OTA). It is a parent company that holds a number of brands such as Booking, KAYAK, RentalCars, Priceline, Agoda and Opentable. As a whole, Booking provides reservation services for customers looking for accommodations, flights, rental cars, taxis, and restaurants. There is a lot interplay between these brands.  Booking categories their revenue as Agency, Merchant &amp; Advertising &amp; Other:    Booking mainly generates revenue on commissions. Agency revenue is when Booking makes a reservation for a customer but does not facilitate payment; the supplier (hotels, airlines, etc) will follow up with the customer for payment. Merchant revenue is when Booking acts as a merchant; i.e. collect payment and remits payment to supplier. Bookings earns commission on both of these categories.  Merchant revenue is catching up and increasing its percentage as a proportion of total revenue and although this doesn't negatively impact Booking in regards to its position in the industry, it does negatively impact their margins.  [\*We can see that as the merchant category increases as a proportion of sales, operating margins are decreasing. Merchant revenue incurs additional expenses.](  ***Advertising &amp; Other*** is revenue mainly earned by KAYAK for its meta-search platform: This platform lists hotel chains, flights, etc on its website. ***I am going to disregard this segment because Google Flights does the same thing, so I am estimating no growth here. Some people view Google as a competitor to Booking, and they do compete against KAYAK. However, Google benefits Booking's Agency and Merchant business since Google refers a lot of people to Bookings platforms. Google is ultimately an advertising business, they don't make reservations or facilitate payments.***  Marketing Expense as a % of Total revenue:  [\* Booking spends a lot on marketing and a lot of this spend is performance marketing on Google.](  Room nights booked *(in mill):*  [\*What I like about this data is that room nights booked \(one night booked = one room night\) in 2022 is higher than 2019, which was the record prior to COVID. Room nights have been increasing significantly in geographical areas \(like Asia-Pacific\) which has lower average daily rates compared to areas like Europe and the U.S. This also impacts their margins.](  # Competitors  Bookings Mix of Room nights for hotels and alternative accommodation:    **AirBnb:**  The way I am thinking about this is 70% of Bookings accommodations are in hotels and motels and AirBnb mainly generate revenue from homes, holiday houses etc. This is only 30% of Bookings business, which they list as alternative. Although these two companies compete, I don't think it will affect Booking if Airbnb continues to grow since they don't specialise in hotel accommodations. I am curious to know your thoughts about this.  **Website Traffic:**  Expedia: 88.68% website traffic in the U.S.  Airbnb: 71.54% website traffic in the U.S  ***Booking: 10.86% website traffic in the U.S***  Most of Bookings website traffic is concentrated in Europe whereas Expedia and Airbnb is concentrated in the U.S. I believe this has other implications, especially when I compare Booking with Expedia that has a business model that is almost identical. Most of the hotel chains in the U.S are very popular: Marriott, Holiday Inn, Hilton, Hampton Inn and Hyatt to name a few. They have their own loyalty programs and big marketing and merchandising (cheap deals) campaigns and customers often seek these hotels out directly, although they are listed on Expedia as well. Since they are popular, they have bargaining power and can request lower commissions to be listed on an OTA. Since Expedia is heavily concentrated in the United States, this has an impact on their margins. Most of Bookings hotel suppliers are outside of the U.S. and these are often smaller, independent chains that rely more heavily on an OTA.  Expedia operating margins:  [\*I think this explains why Expedia's margins are a lot lower than Booking despite similar business models.](  # Industry  OTA industry estimates suggest it will grow to over $1 trillion at the end of 2030. It is currently at $521 billion. Estimated growth is just over 10%.  # Intrinsic Value Estimate:  Historical data *(in mill)*:    Growth rates:    I have taken the current year FCF estimate (2023 FY results isn't out yet), and have estimated a growth rate of 8% in yrs 1-5 and 6% in yrs 6-10, discount rate of 10% and terminal value of 20. The growth rates are estimated because of the industry growth projections and Bookings position in the market. Also the 5-year previous growth rates for Booking was 8%, which was the lowest compared to my 1-3-7 and 9 years growth rates so I went with that. 8% is a lower growth rate than the industry growth projections and I wanted to be conservative, especially since the FCF in the current year is at record highs. I always like putting a lower growth rate in the latter half (6%) because it is a lot harder to estimate. The discount rate is high, however, my style has always been to make fewer bets for higher returns and I am happy being patient until those opportunities arrive. This gave me an intrinsic value of $4,296. I try and go a bit further to see if I can get a discount to intrinsic value.  &amp;#x200B;  Margin of Safety Price ranges *(Discount to Intrinsic Value):*  [\*The calculator estimated these prices.](  # Risk:  * Interest debt has been increasing over the past 10 years. * COVID really impacted the OTA industry and who knows if another similar crises will occur  \*\*\* I did not invest in this company, I just wanted to share my thoughts.  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2024-01-24 12:49:10]
[Last week's market performance and economic news review,;,; Last week was another solid week for the global stock markets, to say the least. However, this time out, it were the European indices that outperformed. US benchmarks all posted green weeks, with the Dow up ever so slightly and the Nasdaq and S&amp;P500 up closer to 0.5% after posting new all-time highs halfway through the week.  Meanwhile, the major European indices posted incredible gains of multiple percentages, which were helped by great results from European heavyweights ASML and LVMH, jumping over 10% on their blowout earnings. As a result, the Euro Stoxx 50 gained over 3% and the Euro Stoxx 600 closer to 2.5%. However, the real European standout was once again the Dutch AEX, which gained over 4%, driven by the performance of ASML, which has a significant 15% weight in the index.  All in all, it is quite a solid performance, especially considering the headwinds global economies and companies continue to face. Whenever you think there is no more upside, the market finds a reason to put down new all-time highs. It just once more proves that the Mr. market is irrational and, above all, completely unpredictable.  Yet, we will add that our view of the markets remains the same. We continue to view current optimism as overdone and expect the markets to show some volatile reactions on important quarterly results and economic data throughout the remainder of Q1 and into Q2. The broader upside is most likely limited.  At the same time, though, there is room for optimism as economic data from last week points in the right direction, making the likelihood for a 25 bps rate cut as early as May somewhat more likely.  [The Commerce Department‚Äôs personal consumption expenditures price index for December]( which is the most crucial inflation indicator for the Federal Reserve, increased by 0.2% month over month and 2.9% YoY, which is roughly in line with projections from Dow Jones analysts.  The 12-month rate is the lowest since March 2021, down from 3.2% in November. So, what does this mean for the Fed and interest rates?  Well, this report confirms that while inflation is certainly sticky and remains elevated, it is trending down progressively and should indicate to the Fed that it can start lowering rates later this year. However, it is no reason to become more bullish than we already were, and a first interest rate cut in June still seems like the most viable option in our eyes.  However, there is room for more positivity, as, on Thursday, a report showed that the U.S. economy grew much faster than expected in the final months of 2023, with [GPD growing by 3.3%]( in Q4.¬†This compared favorably to a Wall Street estimate for just 2% growth and is no massive slowdown from the 4.9% reported in Q3.  This highlights that even in the face of high-interest rates, the U.S. economy continues to fire on all cylinders. Meanwhile, inflation is trending down strongly, with the PCE price index rising 2.7%, down from 5.9% a year ago, while the core figure posted a 3.2% increase annually, compared with 5.1% one year ago.  While the markets showed little response to these numbers due to the data being backward-looking and the market being a forward-looking machine, this could bode well for the Fed‚Äôs commitment to lower rates. According to the CME Group, the Fed will almost certainly keep rates flat in both the January 31st meeting and the March 20 meeting.  However, the market does still price in a high likelihood for the Fed to announce the first rate cut in May, which might still be slightly too optimistic, though not impossible, looking at these December numbers, assuming inflation data in upcoming months shows solid progress.  Even more positive news for the Fed was the surprising weakness in the labor market, with initial jobless claims data for the week ending Jan. 20 coming in surprisingly high. Initial jobless claims totaled 214,000, up by 25,000 from the prior week and above the Dow Jones estimate of 199,000. For a while now, the Fed has been looking for some softening in the labor market, and while this single week is no real solid indication, this will be what officials are looking for.  Positively, with regard to the tight labor market, tech layoffs ballooned so far in January, with over 23,500 employees laid off from 85 different technology companies, which is massive, [as reported by CNBC]( That is the highest number since March 2023.  Meanwhile, unsurprisingly, the European Central Bank held rates steady on Wednesday and gave little insight or indication of future rate cuts. It said that recent data had broadly confirmed its previous inflation outlook and that a declining trend in underlying inflation had continued. Like the Federal Reserve, the ECB indicated that its decision-making will be data-driven, fixating on economic data.  As of Thursday morning, markets were pricing in a 62% probability of a rate cut in April, according to LSEG data.  On another positive note, [Citi analysts expect]( economic growth to accelerate next year and to return to healthy levels relatively quickly. According to Citi analysts, the U.S. should be able to avoid an economic collapse.  Furthermore, [Citi also believes]( the S&amp;P500 is not as expensive as it seems and blames the rather high valuation of 22x trailing earnings on the magnificent 7, painting a misleading picture.¬†According to its equal-weight calculations, the index is realistically trading closer to 19x earnings, which is not as concerning.  Yes, this sounds a bit like they are looking for the bright spots to stay optimistic, creating their own valuations, but they also make a fair point. While technology and the largest S&amp;P500 stocks are trading at very demanding valuations, most of the companies in the S&amp;P500 aren‚Äôt all that expensive compared to historical multiples.,;,; 2024-01-29 19:04:17]

The central bank hiked rates by a quarter-point. However, it also hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be ending soon. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that credit conditions have tightened, which could put pressure on the economy. ***** &gt; The ‚Äúprimary driver of market volatility is investors assessing the push-and-pull between price stability and financial stability,‚Äù said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. Hainlin said that the Fed has a ‚Äúmandate to tame inflation while also limiting further strains on capital market activity that can stem from ongoing rate hikes.‚Äù ***** &gt; Investors also kept an eye on regional banks.

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 18th, 2023,;,; Good Friday afternoon to all of you here on r/StockMarket! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 18th, 2023.  # **Dow, Nasdaq close higher Friday, extending rally to a seventh winning week: Live updates- [(Source)]( ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher Friday after a whipsaw session, where it marked a fresh intraday record, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 closed at a record high, as Wall Street pushed both major indexes to their seventh-straight winning week. ***** &gt; The Dow closed up 56 points, or 0.2%, at 37,305.16. The S&amp;P 500 slipped 36 points, or 0.01%, to 4,719.19 while the Nasdaq Composite closed up 52 points, or 0.4% at 14,813.92. The Nasdaq-100 broke above 16,573.34, a record closing high reached in November 2021. ***** &gt; Shares of Costco ended the day up 4.5% after hitting an all-time high during the session. The retailer surpassed Wall Street‚Äôs estimates for quarterly results and issued a dividend of $15 per share. ***** &gt; Both the 30-stock Dow and the tech-heavy Nasdaq notched their seventh straight positive week. As of Friday, the Dow is higher on the month by 3.7%. The S&amp;P 500 is up by 3.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite has climbed 4.2% so far in December. The S&amp;P 500‚Ä≤s close brought the index just shy of its seventh straight weekly gain, which would have marked its longest winning streak since 2017. The S&amp;P 500 could still soon join the Dow with its own all-time high, however, as the broad market index is less than 2% away from a record close set in January 2022. ***** &gt; Wall Street rallied this week after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday admitted that its efforts to tamp down inflation are taking hold, and indicated three interest rate cuts are coming in 2024, buoying investor sentiment. The November retail sales data that came in stronger than expected on Thursday, following this week‚Äôs cooler inflation readings, added to hopes the Federal Reserve could navigate a soft landing. ***** &gt; That said, New York Fed President John Williams pushed back on the euphoria around the central bank easing rates next year. ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt really talking about rate cuts right now,‚Äù Williams told CNBC‚Äôs Steve Liesman in an interview on Friday. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúStocks got a major sentiment boost from Wednesday‚Äôs Fed meeting, but that immediate effect was bound to wear off,‚Äù said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading and investing at E-Trade. ‚ÄúThe market doesn‚Äôt go up every day, no matter how strong a trend is. Pullbacks and pauses are inevitable, regardless of how big they are or how long they last.‚Äù  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #1!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #2!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #3!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD LINK #4!](  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](  *****  &gt; # Magnificent Seven Market Cap Round Trip  &gt; At the start of 2022, the seven largest S&amp;P 500 stocks by market cap (which have begun to colloquially be called the Magnificent Seven) possessed a combined market cap of $11.78 trillion. However, severe losses throughout 2022 meant that by the end of the year these stocks were down 47.7% on average. In terms of the combined market cap, that dropped the total down to just $6.9 trillion. In 2023, those same seven stocks have averaged a gain of 106.6%. While not all of these stocks have fully recovered‚Äîfor example, Telsa (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Meta (META) all have lower market caps than at the start of 2022‚Äîthe strong performance this year on the whole has meant the combined market cap has made a round trip. Now back to square one, what‚Äôs next?  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # All About Dow New Highs  &gt; In the face of many worries, stocks have put together a historic year in ‚Äô23. To top things off, the Dow just hit a fresh new all-time high, its first new high since January 4, 2022.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; **New Highs Happen More Than You Think** Interestingly, this marked the 11th consecutive year that the Dow made a new high, the second longest streak ever! Of course, the previous two calendar years have had a total of only four new highs, but it still counts.  &gt; Since 1900 there have been nearly 1,400 new highs, which actually comes out to 4.5% of all days since 1900 closing at a new all-time high. That is probably much more than most people expect.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; **Stocks Lead the Economy** &gt; Since markets are forward looking, stocks tend to lead the economy. This can work on the way up and way down, so for us new highs right now is suggesting the economy is on firm footing heading into ‚Äô24 and a stronger economy (with no recession) could be the play next year.  &gt; Sure, there are always some examples of that ‚Äòfinal new high‚Äô right before trouble (1929, 2000, and 2007), but looking back at history, new highs rarely suggest impending doom right around the corner.  &gt; Since World War II, there were 227 months that saw at least one new high for the Dow. A recession started within a year of one of those months only 26 times, or 11.5% of the time. Compare this with the economy being in a recession 13.9% of the time since WWII and new highs could be a subtle positive sign for the economy next year.  &gt; The last new high for the Dow was nearly two years ago, so what happens after the Dow goes a long time without new high? I found 12 times since WWII it went at least a full year without a new high and then made one, and only twice did the economy fall into a recession within a year of that new high.  &gt; What stood out about those two times was both saw Middle East turmoil and a spike in crude oil, likely contributing to the recession. Given the US now produces more oil than anyone, does it makes sense to bet against history and treat this new high as an exception? Here‚Äôs a tweet I sent on this idea.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; **Now What?** &gt; Plain and simple, new highs aren‚Äôt bearish events. In fact, you tend to see new highs take place during bull markets, with more advances potentially ahead. We‚Äôve been calling this a new bull market for over a year now. As far back as last November we said the lows were in and there would be no recession in 2023 (with many arguing with us the whole way up).  &gt; In fact, here‚Äôs an interview I did six months ago with Scott Wapner on CNBC‚Äôs Closing Bell. When he asked me what my biggest worry was, I said it was that too many people were bearish and weren‚Äôt embracing this bull market.  &gt; So what do new highs mean by the numbers? By itself, a new high doesn‚Äôt appear to signal any warnings. In fact, things look about average after new highs. There are the nearly 1,400 new highs since 1900 and a year later the Dow was up 7.8% on average and higher 70.2% of the time. Compare this with the average year since 1900, which was up 7.4% on average and higher 65% of the time.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; But the Dow‚Äôs long break without a new high until now improves the outlook historically. Looking at those 12 times (since WWII) the Dow went at least one year without a new high and then finally made one, ol‚Äô Papa Dow was higher a year later 10 times and up an average of 14.1% with a very solid median return of 16.4%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Wealth Effect Picks Up Into Christmas  &gt; With just two weekends left to shop before Christmas, US consumers have to be feeling a little more flush than they were just a couple months ago. Back in October, the stock market was in a 10%+ drawdown and interest rates looked like they might never stop going up. Less than two months later, though, the S&amp;P 500 Total Return index is suddenly trading at all-time highs as Treasury yields have plummeted.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Maybe just as important for that "wealth effect" feeling is the huge drop in gas prices that we've seen since late September. Back on September 17th, AAA's national average gas price reading (the cost of a gallon of regular unleaded) hit a 52-week high of $3.88. In the three months since then, there has hardly been a day when gas prices haven't gone down, and just yesterday the price/gallon ticked down to $3.087. That drop took gas prices below the low of $3.096 seen last December 22nd to their lowest levels in more than two and a half years dating back to 6/24/21.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; With the stock market at new highs again and gas prices suddenly approaching a "2-handle," Santa may have a little more room in his gift sack this year!  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](  *****  &gt; # FAANG+ Leaving Newcomers in the Dust  &gt; Both the NYSE FAANG+ Index and Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) have put in place fresh 52-week highs in the past couple of days, however, zooming out, those fresh highs are on different planets. The NYSE FAANG+ index‚Äîcomprised of many mega cap Tech stocks‚Äîis not only at a 52-week high, but it's trading at record highs. Since the pre-COVID market high in February 2020, the FANG+ group is now up 120.1%. As for the IPO ETF, this week's 52-week high only leaves the group at the highest levels since April 2022. Contrary to the all-time high for FAANG+, IPO is still down 51.7% from its February 2021 high and is up a meager 4.7% since pre-COVID. As you can see below, these two traded closely inline with each other in the early days of the post-COVID rally, but FANG+ has left IPO in the dust since the start of 2022.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Bulls Take the Majority  &gt; More and more equity indices are hitting fresh record highs with the S&amp;P 500 within 1.5% of doing the same. Understandably on these moves, investor sentiment has gotten a further boost. Per the latest AAII Investor Sentiment Survey, 51.3% of investors reported as bullish this week. And keep in mind, due to the timing of the survey, that would not have fully captured any investor response to yesterday's FOMC. That is the highest and first reading above 50% since July 20th of this year when bulls were only 0.1 percentage points higher. Outside of that week, it would be the highest bullish sentiment reading since April 2022.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Given the new high in bulls, bears have been nowhere to be found. A meager 19.3% of respondents reported as bearish this week. That surpasses the recent low of 19.6% from just two weeks ago for the lowest amount since the first week of January 2018 when only 15.56% of responses were bearish.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The overwhelmingly bullish sentiment can also be observed through the bull-bear spread. Currently, the share of bulls outnumber bears by 32 percentage points. That is the widest margin in favor of bulls since April 2021. Looked at another way, that is 2.1 standard deviations above the historical average of the spread meaning sentiment is extremely extended..  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The cheery sentiment on the part of investors certainly means there is a warm and fuzzy feeling during this holiday season, but we would note that sentiment is historically a contrarian indicator. In other words, opposite to what investors are feeling, extremely bullish sentiment readings have historically been followed by more lackluster returns.  *****  &gt; # Claims Cooling Down  &gt; Economic data this morning broadly came in healthier than expected, including weekly jobless claims. Initial claims were expected to go unchanged at 220K. While that previous week's reading was revised up to 221K, this week's print fell all the way down to 202K. That is the lowest reading on jobless claims since the week of October 14th and September 16th before that. In all, that makes for one of the lowest readings on claims since January of last year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Before seasonal adjustment, claims are largely following the usual seasonal pattern having been trending higher since the early fall. Currently at 248.3K, unadjusted claims are running at the lowest level for the comparable week of the year since 1969.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Continuing claims have gotten much more elevated than initial claims over the past few months. Currently totaling 1.876 million, continuing claims have risen meaningfully from the low of 1.658 million put in place just three months ago. However, the consistent pace of increases over that span (every week from September 16th through the first week of November saw a week over week increase) has slowed, having been more choppy in the past month. In fact, at 1.876 million, the current reading is still almost 50K below the recent high of 1.925 million set in mid-November.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Moderating Inflation &amp; Final Fed Meeting Clear Path for late-December Surge  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; This week‚Äôs CPI and PPI releases showed the moderating trend of inflation continues. Prices are still rising just at a slower pace and the rate of change could finally fall back before the Fed‚Äôs target of 2% next year. In response to and in anticipation of lower interest rates, the market has enjoyed above average gains in December.  &gt; As of the close on December 12, DJIA was up 1.74%, S&amp;P 500 +1.66%, NASDAQ +2.16% and Russell 2000 up an impressive 3.99% (right side vertical axis of chart above). The market did experience some typical early December weakness this year after bucking the trend of weakness on the first trading day. Even though the market has already enjoyed above average gains this month, we still anticipate more to come with the potential for a new all-time closing high from DJIA before year end.  *****  &gt; # Inflation Still Moving in the Right Direction  &gt; This morning‚Äôs Consumer Price Index for November was mostly in line with expectations (although the headline reading was slightly higher than expected), and the lack of any meaningful surprises has allowed the market to continue with what has lately been the path of least resistance, which has been higher. The report also showed that the most rapid leg of disinflation is most likely behind us, and while that could lead some to believe that the road ahead will be a slog, that isn‚Äôt necessarily the case.  &gt; For starters, the focus of monthly inflation reports lately has been in Core CPI (ex-food and energy). After peaking at 6.6% in June 2022, the November year/year reading came in at 4.0% for the second month in a row.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The chart below shows the historical 12-month rate of change in the y/y core CPI. Over the last 12 months, that rate of increase has declined by two full percentage points, and outside of the prior two months, that is one of the sharpest declines since the early 1980s. In other words, the 12-month rate of change is still declining, but the pace of decline is slowing.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; November‚Äôs streak also ended what has been a monumental streak of monthly declines in the y/y core CPI reading. At seven months in October, it was the second longest streak on record, trailing only the ten-month streak of declines ending in December 1975.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Understandably, the end of the streak of declines along with the slowing rate of decline in the y/y core CPI reading could lead one to think that inflation levels are plateauing at a higher level. However, a look at the trend of monthly prints in core CPI shows a potential tailwind in the months ahead. The chart below shows the monthly change in core CPI over the last 24 months. While it hasn‚Äôt exactly been linear, the trend is lower. In the twelve months from December 2021 through November 2022, eight out of twelve monthly prints were 0.5% or above, but in the last twelve months, only one print has been 0.5%.  &gt; Just looking at the last year (shaded area in chart) it‚Äôs a similar trend. From December 2022 through May 2022, every monthly print was 0.4% or above, but in the most recent six months, every print has been 0.3% or below. If just the trend of the last six months remains in place, for the next six months the y/y reading will be replacing monthly prints of 0.4% or more with prints of 0.3% or less which should help to keep the trend of disinflation going.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Small Business Sentiment Mixed Under the Hood  &gt; The NFIB unveiled its latest look at small business sentiment early this morning. The headline number remains in the bottom decile of its historical range, falling 0.1 points to 90.6 in November. That is compared to expectations which called for the number to be unchanged last month.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Across the categories factoring into the index, breadth was mixed in November with four categories falling, four rising, and one unchanged. Like the headline number, many categories are also in the bottom few percentiles of their respective historical ranges, albeit with some exceptions like robust readings in plans to increase employment, current inventories, and job openings hard to fill.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; As we discussed in our Morning Lineup, combining the report's readings on employment shows some rebounding conditions for labor markets over the past few months. Looking more closely, though, it is hard to say labor market conditions are materially accelerating. As shown, hiring plans have risen, but on net more companies are reporting negative employment changes. In a similar vein, compensation plans have risen sharply including a six point jump month over month in November (the largest one month increase since last October and the third largest on record), even though actual changes to compensation have been flat. Meanwhile, fewer businesses are reporting job openings are hard to fill. Small businesses are showing labor conditions have cooled over the past couple of years but are far from weak as any more recent improvements have been from plans rather than observed changes.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Similarly, sales expectations rebounded in November, contrary to a flat reading on actual sales and earnings changes. Perhaps most importantly, the share of businesses reporting higher prices has fallen down to 25, matching the July low. In combination with the higher reading on sales expectations, that likely helped the number of firms reporting now as a good time to expand.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Looking at the reverse, of those reporting now as not a good time to expand, the single biggest reason given for such sentiment was economic conditions. That is typically the most widely cited reason historically followed by political climate (the NFIB has a tendency to be sensitive to politics, namely which party holds the presidency), but for the first time in at least a decade, financial conditions and interest rates earned the number two spot. As shown below, the number of firms reporting that rates are holding them back from expanding has risen steadily since the current tightening cycle began.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; As mentioned previously, actual earnings changes saw no improvement in November and are sitting near historically weak levels. As for the reasons given for lower earnings, increased costs remain a key reason, but November also saw a significant jump in those reporting sales volumes as a problem. In other words, inflation and weaker demand appear to be weighing on small business earnings.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Despite the burden of interest rates and expectations for credit conditions sitting at the lowest levels in over a decade, small businesses have actually increased capital expenditures dramatically to a new post-pandemic high. However, that is counter to capital expenditure plans, which have fallen in the past few months, and inventories showing drawdowns.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  Here is the full list of companies report earnings for this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release &amp; consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:  *****  &gt; # ***Monday 12.18.23 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) (NONE.)  &gt; # ***Monday 12.18.23 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](  *****  &gt; # ***Tuesday 12.19.23 Before Market Open:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](  &gt; # ***Tuesday 12.19.23 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](  *****  &gt; # ***Wednesday 12.20.23 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](  &gt; # ***Wednesday 12.20.23 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](  *****  &gt; # ***Thursday 12.21.23 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](  &gt; # ***Thursday 12.21.23 After Market Close:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!](  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 12.22.23 Before Market Open:***  &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES LINK!]()) (NONE.)  *****  &gt; # ***Friday 12.22.23 After Market Close:*** &gt; ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME &amp; ESTIMATES!]()) (NONE.)  *****  # DISCUSS!

[Don't overlook these 3 upcoming earnings reports.,;,;    Earnings season is always an exciting time to be an investor, with companies finally pulling the curtain back and unveiling what‚Äôs transpired behind closed doors.  As usual, the big banks opened the season, with things shifting into a higher gear this week.  For those seeking companies that could positively surprise during the action-packed period, Meta Platforms (META Quick $**META** ) , General Electric ($**GE** ) , and American Air Lines ($**AAL** ) could all be contenders. ¬†  Below is a chart illustrating the year-to-date performance of all three stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.  [ ](  Currently, all three sport a positive Zacks Earnings ESP.  Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) finds companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is more accurate and can better predict the future, providing investors an advantage in earnings season.  **Meta Platforms**  An investor favorite, Meta Platforms, has seen its near-term earnings outlook shift bright over the last several months, landing the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Currently, $META has an Earnings ESP Score of 7.8%, with earnings expected on April 26th.  The company posted a big beat in its latest release, surpassing the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 40% and delivering a 3% sales surprise. Below is a chart illustrating the market‚Äôs reaction to previous quarterly releases.  [ ](  For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $1.96 indicates a pullback within earnings year-over-year. In addition, the company‚Äôs top line is also forecasted to retrace marginally, with the $27.5 billion quarterly estimate indicating a 1.5% Y/Y decline.  [ ](  **American Airlines**  American Airlines‚Äô earnings outlook has improved substantially across all timeframes over the last 60 days, reflecting bullish sentiment among analysts. Currently, AAL has an Earnings ESP Score of 67%, with earnings scheduled to hit on April 27th.  [ ](  The company‚Äôs growth is hard to ignore; the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.04 for the quarter to be reported implies an improvement of 100% year-over-year. Further, our consensus revenue estimate stands at $12.3 billion, nearly 40% higher than year-ago quarterly sales of $8.9 billion.  As we can see below, the company‚Äôs revenue has recovered from the pandemic shock, with sales now eclipsing pre-pandemic levels.  [ ](  **General Electric**  Like the stocks above, General Electric has witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions, helping push the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). GE currently has an Earnings ESP Score of 10.1%, with earnings expected to drop on April 25th.  The market reacted well to the company‚Äôs latest earnings release, as we can see illustrated in the chart below. General Electric posted earnings of $1.24 per share, reflecting a solid 12% beat. Impressively, the company boasts a 28% four-quarter trailing average EPS beat Regarding the upcoming release, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.13 indicates a decline in earnings from the year-ago quarter. The company‚Äôs top line is forecasted to witness a slowdown also, with the $13.4 billion quarterly estimate implying a decline of roughly 20% year-over-year.   [https:\/\/ 2023-04-19 05:17:40]

[$META earnings: time to buckle up,;,; Meta Platforms Inc ($ META), formerly known as Facebook, had an impressive Q1 2023 earnings report, beating analysts' expectations and showing strong growth in several key areas. As a result, the company's shares gapped up on Thursday's open to the tune of 15%. It was both a remarkable result and a remarkable response, which bodes well for the tech company as a whole.  How both Google and Apple had done just enough to keep the tech industry buoyant with their earnings beats, but this from Meta is a whole other story. The share price action suggests that the positive momentum could continue in the coming days, so get excited. It's a similar gap to what they experienced at the end of Jan, and it could be looking at the start of another fresh multi-month rally.  ## Smashing Expectations  Digging into the numbers, the company's GAAP EPS came in at $2.20, well ahead of the consensus estimate of $1.97. Meanwhile, the company's revenue of $28.6 billion also beat expectations and showed growth of 2.7% year on year. It wasn't quite the double-digit growth results of yesteryear, but like their tech titan peers yesterday, it will be more than good enough for now.  But the recovery story has been truly one for the ages. Since last November, Meta shares have tacked on 175%, including this morning's jump. And the cherry on top? Well, they're still only barely halfway on their journey to undoing all of last year's selloff.  The past quarter's numbers were driven largely by growth in the company's advertising business, which crushed analyst expectations and surprised investors. Meta's user base also continued to grow, with daily active users (DAUs) reaching 2.04 billion. The company also noted that its efforts to increase ad efficiency had paid off, with the average price per ad increasing by 22% year-on-year. In addition, management saw fit to issue forward guidance that also came in hot, with Looking Ahead  In addition to its advertising business, Meta's other business units also showed strong growth. Looking ahead, Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, highlighted the company's focus on privacy and building a metaverse, a shared virtual space that's expected to be the next big thing in social media. The company is also investing in its messaging platforms, such as WhatsApp and Messenger, to drive further growth and revenue.  Meta strong earnings report is likely to have a positive impact on the broader tech market, particularly other social media companies. Shortly after the market opened on Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 index was up a cool 1.25%, with most commentators thanking Meta for the boost. Those of us on the sidelines know that analysts are remaining bullish on Meta's prospects for the near and medium term. MarketBeat's MarketRank Forecast has a Moderate Buy rating on the stock, based on 40 Buy recommendations out of a total of 49 market ratings.  Some price targets to be kept in mind include the Royal Bank of Canada's $285, Deutsche Bank's $290 and Guggenheim's $320. The latter of these is pointing to an upside of more than 30%, and that's including this morning's jump.  So get excited, both for Meta and tech as a whole. Their strong earnings report is a positive sign for the company and will reinforce those from their peers yesterday.,;,; 2023-04-28 07:16:54]
[Tesla ($TSLA) stock and six other tech titans are responsible for 86% of the S&amp;P 500 2023 performance.,;,;    Tesla($TSLA) stock **plunged nearly 10% last week on earnings**. That caught everyone's attention, but it was just the tip of the iceberg.  0 seconds of 14 secondsVolume 0%   With roughly one-third of the S&amp;P 500 companies **announcing quarterly earnings results this week**, there are none bigger than tech titans **Alphabet** ($**GOOGL**), **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**) and **Meta Platforms** ($META). These four Big Tech stocks alone account for 41% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 year-to-date gain, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.  Adding **Apple** ($**AAPL**), which reports next week, **Nvidia** ($**NVDA**) and **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) stock, Colas says these seven tech giants account for 86% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 gain, which was 7.7% through Monday's close. These seven Big Tech stocks have rallied far more than the S&amp;P 500 this year.  According to Colas, there have been three drivers of outperformance for these tech leaders. First, all seven were deeply oversold at the end of 2022 and received a "January Effect" bounce.  The January Effect is a seasonal increase in stock prices throughout the month of January. The increase in demand for stocks in January is often preceded by a decrease in prices during the month of December, in part due to tax-loss harvesting.     Second, many of these tech companies have been aggressively cutting costs, so earnings power should now be higher than last year. And, finally, interest rates have declined, supporting the valuation of high-multiple stocks, he added.  ## Alphabet, Microsoft Earnings Due  Google-owner Alphabet reports earnings after the closing bell Tuesday. Shares are just below a 106.69 buy point in a **cup with handle**, according to **IBD MarketSmith** chart analysis.  Alphabet earnings are expected to measure $1.08 a share on revenue of $68.8 billion.  Dow Jones software giant Microsoft slid almost 2% midday Tuesday, threatening to extend a losing streak to four sessions ahead of the company's earnings results late Tuesday. MSFT stock is rolling back toward a 276.86 buy point in a **flat base** following a March 17 breakout.  Wall Street expects Microsoft to earn $2.24 a share on revenue of $51.0 billion, per FactSet estimates.     ## Amazon, Meta Earnings Also On Deck  E-commerce giant Amazon continues to trace the right side of a **cup base**, but is seeing resistance around its long-term 200-day moving average.  With earnings due out late Thursday, Amazon is expected to earn 21 cents a share on sales of $124.5 billion.  Facebook parent Meta Platforms will report Wednesday after the stock market closes. Meta stock is out of buy range past a **197.26 buy point** in a flat base, but receding.  The social media giant is expected to earn $2.02 a share on revenue of $27.6 billion.  ## Apple Earnings Next Week  Apple shares reversed squarely lower midday Tuesday. Still, they remain solidly above a 157.48 buy point and at the top of the **5% buy range** that runs up to 165.35.  The Dow Jones tech giant reports its fiscal second-quarter results on May 4. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to earn $1.43 a share on sales of $92.9 billion.     ## Nvidia Holds Up; Tesla Stock Breaks Down  Graphics-chip maker Nvidia remains near its recent highs despite sharp losses midday Tuesday. Shares declined more than 2% in afternoon trade.  The **IBD Leaderboard stock** broke out past a 230.59 handle buy point after the **company's strong earnings on Feb. 23**.

[[Week 2] AI momentum trading journey guided by chat GPT/LLM. Feedback welcome,;,; This is a follow-up on my latest AI trading post where I laid out my short/mid term bullish case on the AI supply chain due to major upcoming disruption driven by policy and private/public markets. Those are:  1. **The Fed‚Äôning:** Major increase in government expenditure in relation to Global GDP that will trickle down into the AI economy. 2. **The upcoming major IOT adoption via regulatory enforcement:** FSMA food traceability act compliance deadline is fast approaching, Chipps Act, etc. 3. **Upstream/Downstream innovation in private markets:** Early stage capital has commoditized AI (APIs, et al.)  with billions of dollars of VC funding. This early stage innovation will trickle down  into public markets sooner that expected.  For those missing initial context, I‚Äôm using AI to invest in AI with automated investing strategies.  **How my AI Momentum Investing strategy is going:**  **The AI portfolio is down slightly from last week (Slowly bouncing back today)**    **I decided to adjust my automated investment strategy midweek (See below)**  ![img](zk5vp690fkeb1 "  ")  1.

[Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY?,;,; A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings:    Data Sources:  * SPY Holdings: [Stock Analysis]( [Schwab]( [Yahoo Finance]( $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST)‚Äã * SFY Holdings: [Stock Analysis]( [Zacks.com]( [Yahoo Finance]( $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST)  **Key Observations:**  * Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. * Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. * Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.  It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.  I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:  1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. 2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&amp;P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. 3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. 4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. 5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. 6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.  It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.  **What are your thoughts?**,;,; 2024-01-24 21:46:21]

[Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&amp;P 500 gains,;,; = just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing =  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023  [  &amp;#x200B;  The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&amp;P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.  &amp;#x200B;  It‚Äôs an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inflation battle, noted FactSet‚Äôs Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 top performing days for the S&amp;P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday‚Äôs close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%.  &amp;#x200B;  Through Dec. 22, the S&amp;P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&amp;P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.  &amp;#x200B;  Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&amp;P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  That didn‚Äôt mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.  &amp;#x200B;  Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.  &amp;#x200B;  Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.  &amp;#x200B;  The strategy ‚Äúindicates the Fed‚Äôs measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,‚Äù Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&amp;P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks‚Äô bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group‚Äôs announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.  &amp;#x200B;  SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a ‚Äúmini‚Äù banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.  &amp;#x200B;  Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks ‚Äî Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com]( Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%,  and Meta Platforms Inc.  META, 0.56%.  &amp;#x200B;  See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?  &amp;#x200B;  Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high:  &amp;#x200B;  The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs overall return, he wrote, with the company‚Äôs success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.,;,; 2023-12-27 15:52:27]

[Dow Jones rises but leaders tumble, and Tesla ($TSLA) stock triggers the sell rule.,;,;  Dow Jones futures were little changed early Thursday, along with S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The stock market rally struggled Wednesday as weak economic data raised recession fears for a second straight session.    The major indexes still don't look too bad, with the Nasdaq sliding but the Dow Jones rising.  But once again, declining stocks decisively beat winners. Once again, many of those losers fell hard. But on Wednesday, a lot of more of those big losers were leading stocks, such as **On Holding** ($**ONON**), **MarketAxess** ($**MKTX**) and **PagerDuty** ($**PD**). **C3.ai** ($**AI**) sold off for a second session, with the AI stock now staging a massive, outside week to the downside.  Others, including many chip names, declined solidly, now showing more chart damage after relatively modest retreats Tuesday.  **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) skidded for a third straight day, triggering the automatic sell rule.   Megacap techs such as **Apple** ($**AAPL**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**), Google parent **Alphabet** (**GOOGL**), **Meta Platforms** ($**META**) and **Nvidia** all fell.  Meanwhile, bank stocks came under more pressure. **Western Alliance Bancorp** (**WAL**) plunged, leading a retreat in regional banks, though they pared losses in the afternoon. **Charles Schwab**hit a two-year closing low. While bank deposits may be relatively safe, the bigger issue now may be long-term bank profitability as well as lending curbs that rapidly slow the economy.  Medical names are looking relatively strong, along with other defensive growth or defensive plays.  PagerDuty stock, On Holding, Meta and Nvidia are on **IBD Leaderboard**. Microsoft and Google stock are on the **IBD Long-Term Leaders** list.   Despite relatively benign action in the major indexes, the weakness in growth and other leading stocks is concerning. Investors should be looking to protect profits and cut losses.  ## Costco Sales Weak  Costco same-store sales fell 1.1% in March vs. a year earlier, the first decline in nearly three years. U.S. comps slid 1.5%. Excluding gasoline and currency effects, comps rose 2.6% or 0.9% in the U.S. E-commerce comps tumbled 11.6%. COST stock fell modestly.  ## Dow Jones Futures Today  Dow Jones futures edged higher vs. fair value. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.2%.  The Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. That follows unexpectedly weak February job openings and the March ADP Employment Report. Labor will release the March jobs report on Friday morning, but U.S. markets will be closed.   ## Stock Market Rally  The stock market rally had a generally negative session, despite the mixed action on the major indexes.  The ADP Employment Report showed private payrolls rose much less than expected in March, a day after a big drop in February job openings. The March ISM services index fell more than expected, signaling rapidly slowing growth.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% in Wednesday's **stock market trading**. The S&amp;P 500 index dipped 0.25%. The Nasdaq composite retreated 1.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 1%.  U.S. crude oil prices dipped 0.1% to $80.61 a barrel.  The 10-year Treasury yield declined 5 basis points to 3.285%. That's the lowest point in nearly seven months. The 2-year Treasury yield sank 7 basis points to 3.76%, off 34 basis points in the past four sessions.  ## ETFs  Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ($**FFTY**) shed 1.9%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ($**BOUT**) gave up 0.65%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ($**IGV**) slipped 1.3%. Microsoft stock and a few other heavyweights dominate IGV, while more-speculative software names like PagerDuty suffered bigger losses. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([**SMH**]( gave up 1.75%, with NVDA stock a major holding.  Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF ($**ARKK**) slumped 3.6% and ARK Genomics ETF (**ARKG**) shed 1.8%. TSLA stock is the top holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. Some Ark funds also own PD stock.  SPDR S&amp;P Metals &amp; Mining ETF (**XME**) retreated 1.15% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (**PAVE**) 1.7%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (**JETS**) and SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (**XHB**) descended 1.5%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (**XLE**) climbed 1.5% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (**XLV**) rallied 1.7% to its best level since Feb. 14.  ## Bank Stocks  The Financial Select SPDR ETF (**XLF**) edged down 0.1%, with SCHW stock a top 10 holding. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (**KRE**), which includes WAL stock, sank 1% but finished off lows.  Western Alliance stock plunged as much as 19.4% after releasing some financial metrics but not disclosing deposits. Shares came off their lows as the California-based bank disclosed deposits fell 11% on March 31 vs. the end of 2022, not as bad as some feared.

[Stock Market Today (as of Mar 15, 2023),;,; Last night, the three major US stock indexes fluctuated and closed higher, with regional banks rebounding and semiconductors leading the market. At the close, the Dow Jones rose 1.06%, the Nasdaq rose 2.14%, and the S&amp;P rose 1.65%.

The US dollar index continued to fall from its high, closing at 103.67.  The US CPI has risen steadily in February due to the high cost of rent, with a month-on-month increase of 0.4% and a year-on-year increase of 6.0%, which is in line with expectations. There is uncertainty among economists as to whether the increase in inflation will be enough to push the Fed to raise interest rates again next week, especially after the bankruptcy of two regional banks. Some economists, including Goldman Sachs, predict that the Fed will pause the current fast monetary policy tightening cycle since the 1980s to avoid the spread of the banking crisis, while financial markets still expect the Fed to raise interest rates by 25 basis points.

[The tech industry's resilience: no signs of earnings recession despite market volatility,;,;  Last week, big U.S. tech companies began reporting their earnings for the first quarter of 2023. The results were generally ahead of estimates; for example, Alphabet revealed that its revenue grew, and that its rate of decline in earnings slowed down. Meta Platforms and others also put out earnings that were well ahead of expectations.  The results seen from U.S. tech companies last week call into question the narrative that we are in the midst of an ‚Äúearnings recession.‚Äù This year, analysts have been busy cutting corporate earnings estimates because of a belief that earnings will decline due to a poor economy. The actual results posted suggest otherwise. Most of the U.S. tech companies are posting positive revenue growth; a few are even growing their earnings.  ## Microsoft beats earnings  **Microsoft ($MSFT)** was a big winner in last week‚Äôs U.S. earnings bonanza. It not only beat expectations but also delivered positive growth in net income, which most of its peers were not able to do. In the first quarter (Q1), MSFT delivered the following:  * $52.86 billion in revenue, up 7% * $22.35 billion in operating income, up 9.7% * $18.3 billion in earnings, up 9.4% * $2.45 in diluted earnings per share (EPS), up 10.3% * A 34.92% profit margin  Overall, it was a very strong quarter. Microsoft easily beat estimates on both revenue and profit, and it guided for further strength in the second quarter. If Microsoft‚Äôs results are any indication, then Canadian tech companies might put out good earnings when they report this week.  ## What‚Äôs next for Canadian stocks?  This week, Canadian tech companies will begin reporting their first-quarter earnings. These releases will show investors whether the companies in question are growing, profitable, and, overall, worth investing in.  **Shopify ($SHOP)** is one Canadian tech stock that will be reporting soon. Its release comes out on May 4 ‚Äî the same day that Apple releases its earnings. Most likely, SHOP‚Äôs release will be overshadowed by Apple‚Äôs more closely watched earnings, but it will be notable in many ways itself.  For one thing, investors will want to know whether Shopify can keep up its high revenue growth. In 2022, Shopify‚Äôs revenue growth decelerated considerably, falling into the low teens. In the fourth quarter, it picked up a little, reaching 26%. Revenue deceleration has been a concern for Shopify, which was previously growing outrageously quickly (sales increased 86% in 2020), but lost its growth in 2022. If revenue growth picks up again, particularly if it exceeds the rate of growth analysts expect, then SHOP stock will likely rally.  Another thing investors will be watching in Shopify‚Äôs first-quarter earnings release is its profitability. Shopify was not profitable last quarter, partially because of losses on its stock portfolio. However, now, with tech stocks rising, Shopify may be able to become profitable again. It already has positive gross profit, but it‚Äôs suffering from the earnings impact of a weak stock market. There is a decent chance that Shopify will turn profitable in Q1, but it‚Äôs not guaranteed. Therefore, it‚Äôs something that investors will want to watch closely in SHOP‚Äôs Q1 earnings release.,;,; 2023-05-02 10:36:47]
[ChatGPT picks a winning stock portfolio and easily beats top-performing funds.,;,;    A fictional stock portfolio curated by ChatGPT has put the Top 10 U.K. funds to shame.   ChatGPT was instructed to assemble a winning stock portfolio. The AI replied that it couldn‚Äôt provide specific investment guidance, but when Finder clarified the exercise was purely theoretical, ChatGPT played ball and gathered 38 stocks to form a fund that did strong numbers in the eight weeks following its creation on March 6, 2023. It outperformed the UK‚Äôs top 10 funds‚Äô average gains in the same time period.  ‚ÄúThe ChatGPT fund has led the real funds for 34 of the 37 market days (87%) of its lifespan so far,‚Äù Finder reported. On April 4, ChatGPT was up 4.7%, while the real funds were left in the dust, down by 1.9%. The top performers of the experimental AI fund (thus far) are Meta, Microsoft, and Intel, all of which are up double-digit percents.     ‚ÄúBig funds have increasingly been using AI for years, but the public using a rudimentary AI platform that openly says its data is patchy since September 2021 and lacks the intricacies of market psychology, doesn‚Äôt sound like a good idea,‚Äù said Finder CEO Jon Ostler.  When surveyed by Censuswide (commissioned by Finder), U.K. respondents offered a glimpse into their comfort level with AI in the personal finance world. Eight percent of surveyed adults indicated they‚Äôd already used AI to get financial advice, while 19% said they‚Äôd consider letting ChatGPT give them financial advice.  This once again highlights the gap between how companies view ChatGPT and how civilians look at the tool. While the average person may see it as an amusement, research assistant, or in-house financial adviser, major companies such as Samsung view it as a security risk of the highest order, hence the aforementioned tech corporation‚Äôs flat-out ban on employees using generative AI for work purposes.

[Earnings wave, Credit Suisse ($CSGN) outflows, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond ($BBBY) bankruptcy‚Äîwhat's moving markets?,;,; U.S. futures point lower as investors look ahead to a wave of massive corporate earnings this week. Credit Suisse suffers significant first quarter outflows, underlining the challenges surrounding its shotgun marriage with rival UBS, while NBCUniversal's CEO resigns and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond files for bankruptcy.  **1. Futures drop as earnings season kicks into full gear**  High-profile corporate names, including some of the world's biggest technology groups, will unveil their latest results this week as concerns persist over a possible slowdown in the U.S. economy.  Companies faced a tumultuous quarter highlighted by stubbornly elevated (but easing) inflation, widespread tech sector layoffs, and the banking crisis.  Google-parent Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN), and Facebook-owned Meta Platforms, Inc. ($META) are all slated to report, along with chip-making giant Intel ($INTC). Consumer goods firm Mondelez International, Inc. ($MDLZ), oil major ExxonMobil Corp. ($XOM), payments processor Mastercard Inc. ($MA), drinks maker Coca-Cola Company ($KO) and drugmaker Eli Lilly and Company ($LLY) are also among the hundreds of businesses due to release their earnings in the coming days.  Last week, JPMorgan ($JPM) chief Jamie Dimon flagged looming economic "storm clouds" on the horizon, adding that the banking industry's recent issues have only exacerbated these fears. However, these worries were somewhat tempered by separate data on Friday which showed that business activity in the U.S. touched an 11-month high in April.  **2.** **Credit Suisse's 'alarming' results**  Credit Suisse ($CSGN) saw CHF 61.2 billion in asset outflows in the first quarter in what is likely to be the final earnings report from the Swiss lender after its merger with rival UBS Group AG ($UBSG).  The bank called the outflows "significant," adding that they have moderated but not yet reversed.  It said that withdrawals of cash deposits and non-renewal of maturing time deposits were most acute in the days preceding and following the announcement of the tie-up last month. Swiss officials brokered the deal to bolster confidence in the country's banking system in the wake of turmoil across the global financial services sector sparked by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.  Customer deposits also declined by CHF 67B in the opening three months of its 2023 fiscal year.  The results, which analysts at KBW called "alarming," set the stage for quarterly figures from UBS due out tomorrow, with investors keen to find out more about how it plans to fold Credit Suisse into its operations.  "UBS undoubtedly faces a major (and urgent) task in deeply restructuring its former competitor," analysts at Vontobel said in a note on Monday.  **3. NBCUniversal CEO to step down**  NBCUniversal chief Jeff Shell will leave following an investigation reportedly led by an outside counsel into a complaint over inappropriate behavior, the media giant's parent Comcast Corp. ($CMCSA) announced in a note to staff.  In a statement, Shell said he had had an "inappropriate relationship" with a female employee. The woman is believed to be a long-time journalist for the company, according to multiple media reports.  "Today is my last day as CEO of NBCUniversal," Shell said on Sunday. The executive, who is married, added that he deeply regretted the relationship.  Shell's departure comes as a precarious time for NBCUniversal. He had been leading a charge to refocus on the firm's operations as it faced increased competition from streaming rivals.  Senior leaders who had been working under Shell will now report to Comcast president Mike Cavanagh, the note said.  **4. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond files for bankruptcy**  U.S. home goods retailer Bed Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. ($BBBY) has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a New Jersey court after it failed to secure funds needed to continue as a going concern.  The embattled business had attempted to stay afloat through a complex sale of preferred stock and warrants that aimed to raise $1B. However, that deal was scrapped last month, leading the company to announce a last-ditch effort to garner $300 million from investors.  But neither this fundraising drive nor a series of store closures have proven to be enough. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is now expected to use the bankruptcy proceedings to give it time to conduct a liquidation of some or most of its assets. Individual shareholders will likely be wiped out in the process.  Should a bidder for the business come forward, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond said it would pursue a sale and move away from liquidation.  The retail chain, which was once a hugely popular staple of suburban American life, had previously tried to overhaul its operations to combat flagging demand for its privately branded products. This push ultimately proved unfruitful with Bed Bath &amp; Beyond posting a loss of about $393M and a 33% fall in sales in the quarter ended on November 26.  **5. Oil slips amid broader economic fears**  Oil prices dropped, extending their recent decline into this week, as traders eyed a darkening outlook for global demand.  Concerns remain that rising interest rates will lead to a broader economic slowdown, particularly in the U.S. economy, the world's biggest consumer of crude.  By 04:17 EST (08:17 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 0.51% lower at $77.47 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell by 0.56% to $81.00 per barrel.  Last week, crude markets slumped to their first weekly loss in five, after data showed that the U.S. implied gasoline demand dropped by 3.9% compared to the same period last year.,;,; 2023-04-25 09:35:25]
[Booking Holdings stock analysis (Burry's 4th Largest Holding),;,; Hi everyone, I hope you are all well. I want to share my thoughts on Booking as a company since I think Booking is interesting. If you're looking for a superficial analysis and don't like reading, look elsewhere. This isn't a superficial analysis, which is what is typically shared. I'll share why I think Booking might be differentiated from major competitors like Expedia and AirBnb. I'll also do an overview of the economics of the business, then write about the industry and competitors and estimate the intrinsic value. As I am sure all of you know, this is just my thoughts so please do your own research. I hope I provide some insights and I welcome an exchange of ideas.  # Company Overview:  Booking is an online travel agency (OTA). It is a parent company that holds a number of brands such as Booking, KAYAK, RentalCars, Priceline, Agoda and Opentable. As a whole, Booking provides reservation services for customers looking for accommodations, flights, rental cars, taxis, and restaurants. There is a lot interplay between these brands.  Booking categories their revenue as Agency, Merchant &amp; Advertising &amp; Other:    Booking mainly generates revenue on commissions. Agency revenue is when Booking makes a reservation for a customer but does not facilitate payment; the supplier (hotels, airlines, etc) will follow up with the customer for payment. Merchant revenue is when Booking acts as a merchant; i.e. collect payment and remits payment to supplier. Bookings earns commission on both of these categories.  Merchant revenue is catching up and increasing its percentage as a proportion of total revenue and although this doesn't negatively impact Booking in regards to its position in the industry, it does negatively impact their margins.  [\*We can see that as the merchant category increases as a proportion of sales, operating margins are decreasing. Merchant revenue incurs additional expenses.](  ***Advertising &amp; Other*** is revenue mainly earned by KAYAK for its meta-search platform: This platform lists hotel chains, flights, etc on its website. ***I am going to disregard this segment because Google Flights does the same thing, so I am estimating no growth here. Some people view Google as a competitor to Booking, and they do compete against KAYAK. However, Google benefits Booking's Agency and Merchant business since Google refers a lot of people to Bookings platforms. Google is ultimately an advertising business, they don't make reservations or facilitate payments.***  Marketing Expense as a % of Total revenue:  [\* Booking spends a lot on marketing and a lot of this spend is performance marketing on Google.](  Room nights booked *(in mill):*  [\*What I like about this data is that room nights booked \(one night booked = one room night\) in 2022 is higher than 2019, which was the record prior to COVID. Room nights have been increasing significantly in geographical areas \(like Asia-Pacific\) which has lower average daily rates compared to areas like Europe and the U.S. This also impacts their margins.](  # Competitors  Bookings Mix of Room nights for hotels and alternative accommodation:    **AirBnb:**  The way I am thinking about this is 70% of Bookings accommodations are in hotels and motels and AirBnb mainly generate revenue from homes, holiday houses etc. This is only 30% of Bookings business, which they list as alternative. Although these two companies compete, I don't think it will affect Booking if Airbnb continues to grow since they don't specialise in hotel accommodations. I am curious to know your thoughts about this.  **Website Traffic:**  Expedia: 88.68% website traffic in the U.S.  Airbnb: 71.54% website traffic in the U.S  ***Booking: 10.86% website traffic in the U.S***  Most of Bookings website traffic is concentrated in Europe whereas Expedia and Airbnb is concentrated in the U.S. I believe this has other implications, especially when I compare Booking with Expedia that has a business model that is almost identical. Most of the hotel chains in the U.S are very popular: Marriott, Holiday Inn, Hilton, Hampton Inn and Hyatt to name a few. They have their own loyalty programs and big marketing and merchandising (cheap deals) campaigns and customers often seek these hotels out directly, although they are listed on Expedia as well. Since they are popular, they have bargaining power and can request lower commissions to be listed on an OTA. Since Expedia is heavily concentrated in the United States, this has an impact on their margins. Most of Bookings hotel suppliers are outside of the U.S. and these are often smaller, independent chains that rely more heavily on an OTA.  Expedia operating margins:  [\*I think this explains why Expedia's margins are a lot lower than Booking despite similar business models.](  # Industry  OTA industry estimates suggest it will grow to over $1 trillion at the end of 2030. It is currently at $521 billion. Estimated growth is just over 10%.  # Intrinsic Value Estimate:  Historical data *(in mill)*:    Growth rates:    I have taken the current year FCF estimate (2023 FY results isn't out yet), and have estimated a growth rate of 8% in yrs 1-5 and 6% in yrs 6-10, discount rate of 10% and terminal value of 20. The growth rates are estimated because of the industry growth projections and Bookings position in the market. Also the 5-year previous growth rates for Booking was 8%, which was the lowest compared to my 1-3-7 and 9 years growth rates so I went with that. 8% is a lower growth rate than the industry growth projections and I wanted to be conservative, especially since the FCF in the current year is at record highs. I always like putting a lower growth rate in the latter half (6%) because it is a lot harder to estimate. The discount rate is high, however, my style has always been to make fewer bets for higher returns and I am happy being patient until those opportunities arrive. This gave me an intrinsic value of $4,296. I try and go a bit further to see if I can get a discount to intrinsic value.  &amp;#x200B;  Margin of Safety Price ranges *(Discount to Intrinsic Value):*  [\*The calculator estimated these prices.](  # Risk:  * Interest debt has been increasing over the past 10 years. * COVID really impacted the OTA industry and who knows if another similar crises will occur  \*\*\* I did not invest in this company, I just wanted to share my thoughts.  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2024-01-24 12:49:10]

[(3/16) Thursday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,;,; #Good morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading day and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, March the 16th, 2023-  *****  # [Dow futures slip, regional bank shares drop: Live updates](  ***** &gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Thursday as regional banks slid once again on growing fears of a crisis in banking within the U.S. and Europe. ***** &gt; Futures tied to the 30-stock index were down 94 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures were down 0.2%, while Nasdaq-100 futures traded up 0.3%. ***** &gt; Credit Suisse announced overnight it will borrow up to nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank to assure short-term liquidity. That offered some relief to the embattled bank in extended hours after it fell to a record low Wednesday following reports that the Saudi National Bank, Credit Suisse‚Äôs largest investor, said it would not provide additional assistance. U.S.-listed shares gained 5% in extended trading after falling just under 14% in the prior session. ***** &gt; But the news was not enough to quell fears on Wall Street of an impending crisis, leading regional banks to take another leg down in Thursday‚Äôs premarket. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) slid 2.6% in extended trading, led down by a more than 26% drop in First Republic Bank. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs also similar to ‚Äô08 is the hunting in the market for who‚Äôs the most weak next,‚Äù said Greg Fleming, CEO of Rockefeller Capital Management and former president of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd the proxy‚Äôs been uninsured deposits.‚Äù ***** &gt; Growing concern over Credit Suisse sent other European banking stocks lower and reverberated in U.S. markets beginning Wednesday. The Dow at one point Wednesday fell 725 points before ending the day down by 280.83 points, or 0.87% lower. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.7%. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no doubt changing the landscape of how we as investors look at the investability of financial institutions that fit in the banking sector,‚Äù said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. ‚ÄúIt also makes us ponder just how the sector would navigate with, in the future, more forms of regulatory pressure on these corporations.‚Äù ***** &gt; Traders will keep an eye out for key economic data, including the latest jobless claims report. Housing starts data from the U.S. Census Bureau is also out at 8:30 a.m. ET.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](  *****  #YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$ZIM $ARCO $ADBE $FDX $DG $ARRY $GTLB $STNE $CPRX $BHIL $BBAI $SKLZ $XPEV $ZEV $FIVE $APRN $LU $OTLY $PATH $S $JBL $EGRX $SENS $INSE $MMAT $FREE $WSM $AQN $BVH $SIG $GETY $HEAR $LEN $TBLT $GRWG $BLDE $BZFD $AGEN $JILL $GRCL $HGTY $KOPN $MOMO $AMRS $CAL $RFIL $MYO $ONDS $PRVB $GERN*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$DG $JBL $WSM $APRN $ASO $SIG $MOMO $TITN $PRVB $TNP $PRTK $RMBL $HNST $DBI $BEKE $DESP $JBI $LE $GIII $AVAH $NYC $PLCE $REE $REAX $WISA $APYX $PKOH $URGN $RCMT $LQDA $MDWD $ACIU $IPA $ITRM $TLS $ACXP $IMV $EVLO $KVHI $TGEN*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!]( ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](  *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!]()**) (N/A.)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:  * FRC * PACW * THMO * SNAP * META * AAPL * SHIB.X * JBL * ADBE * DG  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](  *****  &gt; **Credit Suisse** ‚Äî U.S.-listed shares of Credit Suisse gained nearly 6% after the Swiss bank said it will borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss National Bank.
