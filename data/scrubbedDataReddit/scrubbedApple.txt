[WTF is going on? (AAPL),;,; No seriously, it‚Äôs actually crazy how no one is talking about the fact that Apple is potentially in a highly dangerous position due to the Anti-Trust lawsuit against Google. You regards realize that this doesn‚Äôt just have implications for Google but will most likely seriously fuck up Apple too if the deal between them to default Google as a search engine is ruled as anticompetitive?  Apple nets $10-$20 BILLION a year just from setting Google as a default on devices and its browsers, and even if the district court doesn‚Äôt go nuclear and void the agreement, kneecapping Apple‚Äôs profits back to the stone age, it could demand that Apple pay out some or all of the money earned through that deal to competing search engines.   Sure guys, Apple will still be Apple, and the technocrats in the courts will continue to suck off corporations, but it‚Äôs not like there isn‚Äôt precedent for Antitrust even if it‚Äôs been a while since such a high profile case.

[Sell AAPL,;,; Apple earnings report does not justify a forward P/E of 28.  I estimate it should be closer to 20 or below.  My rational:    1. Revenue down for 3 straight quarters.   2. iPhones, Mac‚Äôs, and iPads stacking up with no buyers in site.    3.  No significant growth in emerging markets.  Folks out there are happy with what they can afford, and a strong $ will suppress growth in China, Indian, and other stagnant economies.    4.  No growth story. Services up a meager 6%. Apple Pay is out there, but Apple is competing in an ocean of pay/banking apps.   5.  Granted a new iPhone is coming - so what?   What‚Äôs special about that??

[AAPL will be in the IA game soon,;,; Sorry for title. Obviously I mean AI  Apple CEO Tim Cook teased that Apple may have an artificial intelligence announcement later this year during a call with analysts after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings.  While Cook‚Äôs remarks on Thursday did not include many details, they did indicate that Apple wants to compete with Microsoft, Google, Amazon, OpenAI and other technology companies working on cutting-edge AI models that can generate text and images.  ADVERTISEMENTSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT ‚ÄúAs we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future,‚Äù Cook said during a call with analysts. ‚ÄúThat includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we‚Äôre excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.‚Äù  Generative AI started drawing significant attention from technology companies and investors starting in 2022, after OpenAI released ChatGPT and image generators rapidly improved. Apple did not announce an advanced AI model last year, although the company has long invested in similar machine learning technology in its chips and software, which can, for example, identify people or pets inside photographs.  Apple typically announces new software in June at its annual developer‚Äôs conference, WWDC. Last year, the company announced an autocorrect feature for the iPhone keyboard based on a transformer-based language model, which shares the same underlying technology as GPT. But Apple never used the phrase ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù during the presentation, preferring the more academic term ‚Äúmachine learning.‚Äù  ‚ÄúLet me just say that I think there‚Äôs a huge opportunity for Apple with Gen AI and AI, without getting into more details and getting out in front of myself,‚Äù Cook said.

[How to play tonight's AAPL Earnings safely,;,; Apple (AAPL), the king of the stock market, reports earnings is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter results after close today. Apple stock has not disappointed this year and the sturdiness of Apple‚Äôs returns simply cannot be understated. The stock is up 30% YTD, 300% over the last five years, and **1100% over the last 10 years**. It isn‚Äôt flawless though, as it was down -30% during 2022. However, it has nearly earned it all back in the first four months of 2023.   As the world‚Äôs leading consumer products and technology company, Apple‚Äôs earnings act as an important forerunner for the broader economy. What should we expect from Tim Apple?   Here‚Äôs what analysts think:  * Earnings: $1.43 per share, according to [Refinitiv](  * Revenue: $92.96 billion, according to Refinitiv  Revenue is expected to *decrease* 4.4% from $97.28 billion in the same quarter a year ago. This isn‚Äôt great, but also not terrible. Something I don‚Äôt often see mentioned about Apple is the strong seasonal tendencies of its revenues. [Take note of this chart.]( In the quarterly revenues, we see revenues regularly explode higher following the holiday season and are then mostly stagnant through the rest of the year. But Q1 2023 sales were below Q1 2022, which shows that there was a YoY slowdown in the most recent holiday season.  Apple prepared investors for a down quarter in January. The company hasn‚Äôt provided formal guidance since 2020, but it gives analysts and investors a number of data points that can be used to roughly estimate its performance.  The information it provided earlier this year suggested that sales would drop for a second straight quarter by roughly 5%. Sales of iPads and Macs are expected to see sharp decreases ‚Äî 12% and 25.4%, respectively ‚Äî and iPhone sales also likely dropped. Analysts polled by [FactSet]( expect annual declines in all of Apple‚Äôs hardware product lines.  The report comes as the PC and smartphone markets are mired in one of the worst slumps in recent years. Electronics sales are down sharply after many consumers bought new PCs and phones during the pandemic and others are tightening their belts because of high inflation or recession worries.  In the first quarter, PC shipments decreased 29%, [according to IDC]( while smartphone shipments were off 14%.  Apple‚Äôs report wraps up earnings season for tech‚Äôs mega-cap companies, after Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft all issued results last week. All four topped analyst estimates, though growth rates were still muted compared to prior years.  While Apple isn‚Äôt immune to the broader market slowdown, some analysts hope it will show strength and resiliency because it sells premium products and has loyal customers. Refinitiv consensus estimates suggest Apple could guide back to growth. They expect 2% expansion in the third quarter. But others are concerned that revenue will keep falling, suggesting that demand for Apple‚Äôs products is eroding.  Does anyone know Samik Chatterjee, the analyst at JPMorgan? He mentioned in a note this week that the "eventual outcome might be simply driven by F3Q guidance, where investors might be looking for assurance and visibility into limited downside despite a tough macro.‚Äù See, if Apple‚Äôs outlook suggests a year-over-year decline that‚Äôs less than 5%, Apple could still ‚Äútriumph‚Äù on fundamentals, at least according to Chatterjee.  Along with earnings, Apple is also likely to update investors on its [capital return authorization]( Analysts expect the iPhone maker to announce plans to spend as much as $90 billion on share repurchases and dividends.  **What about the Technicals?**  There isn‚Äôt a clean chart pattern to trade AAPL from, [but this large range looks significant]( The $180 level is resistance and $130 support. Right now, price is in no-mans land in the middle of this large range.  If price can clear the $180 level, resistance should turn into support, and the next multi-year leg higher in Apple should commence. However, a rejection at $180 would be very significant. If the stock can‚Äôt clear that level, it may be indicative of not just Apple, but the market more broadly.  With a recession likely coming later this year, it is possible we will see Apple retest the high of the range, and then as the recession takes hold, swing back down to the bottom of the range. Rather than trying to short the stock, investors would be better off waiting for price to come back down to the $130-$140 buy zone.  **Valuation??**  The price of Apple is currently 28 times its one-year forward profits, which is higher than both the market average and its five-year median price of 24 times. Despite being one of the most respected companies in the world, this valuation is neither particularly high nor low. The bears don't have a good time with this fair assessment.  **What to do for Earnings?**  Apple is a juggernaut in the stock market, and its supremacy is undeniable. Apple brought luxury to the masses, so if the average person begins to feel the heat of a slowing economy, they probably won‚Äôt be buying a new iPhone. Does this mean puts for earnings? We know the stock moves on average 5 ¬± 3% with earnings. However last quarter, it moved +7%, the one before it was +9% and the one before it was +6%. Wait, so calls? I'm thinking a strangle. I'm going to bet that while it moves on average 5%, it's going to move more, without attempting to predict whether it's going up or down. So I'll be buying AAPL 5/5 160p (at 138 bucks) and 170c (at 150 bucks). This means you can get the strangle for $288. The stock would have to move 4.6% up or 5.1% down to break even. Mind you, this post is not financial or investment advice - consider it as just me offering some education based on what analysts tend to look for in a company when it's time to make a last minute earnings prediction. In fact, just because I'm posting it, AAPL might just stay flat.,;,; 2023-05-04 18:55:29]
[$MASI ($AAPL‚Äôs current nemesis),;,; What do we think about $MASI (the company responsible for Apple halting sales of their watches due to claims of Apple ripping off their patents on blood O2 sensor). Currently $6B market cap could easily see Apple having to pay out several times more than that to settle with them.  This is a multi year long case that seems to be coming to fruition fast. Overall the chart looks bullish (not saying much with everything bullish rn) but they have other tech and products so this isn‚Äôt just a pure play on the Apple case - meaning if the case fails I don‚Äôt see the stock dumping solely because of it.   What do we think? Terrible spreads on their options but 1/19/24s are well after the 12/25 date the White House has to figure shit out with the current restrictions.

[AAPL Play?,;,; Hello everyone! I have been a lurker on the sub for a few months and want to post about a small position I am taking and I am sure many others are. Tech companies like META and MSFT beat earnings and their stock prices spiked after. I see an opportunity with MSFT earnings coming out first, them beating earnings, and their stock price blowing up, followed by the same thing happening with META a day later. I feel like the market should've priced this in because they are in the same industry, but it still happened so I feel AAPL has a chance to do the same.   Here's my position and reasoning. I bought 10 call contracts with a strike of $190 expiring 5/5. The IV is 38.18% and my breakeven is $190.04. I feel if AAPL beats earnings the same way its competitors did, it will see a similar jump in share price. Yes, Q1 revenue was down 5% compared to the previous year while MSFT was up 11% over the same period of time. I feel this provides more upside potential for AAPL if they beat earnings.  I didn't use a large portion of my portfolio in this position, so this is mainly a learning experience. I'm sure I am missing something very clear, please poke holes in this and fill me in on where I am wrong and where this could be improved. Thank you!,;,; 2023-04-28 16:07:29]

[Anyone buying AAPL calls before WWDC,;,; apple is about to announce product which may lead to a big stock increase  Given the recent rumors of Apple's highly anticipated VR headset announcement on June 5th, there has been speculation regarding market interest in purchasing Apple call options. This is because Apple has historically experienced significant stock price increases upon the release of new products, especially those that break new ground in their respective markets.  For example, Apple's first iPhone release in 2007 revolutionized the smartphone industry and generated a lot of excitement and anticipation. In the months leading up to the announcement, there was a lot of buzz around the product, and this was reflected in the company's stock price. On the day of the announcement, Apple's stock jumped 8%, and continued to rise in the following weeks, resulting in a 25% increase in the company's market cap.  Similarly, the release of the iPad in 2010 generated a lot of hype and speculation, and Apple's stock price saw a substantial increase in the months leading up to the announcement. On the day of the announcement, Apple's stock rose 1.2% and continued to rise in the following weeks, leading to a 12% increase in the company's market cap.  More recently, the announcement of the Apple Watch in 2014 generated a lot of buzz and excitement, and the company's stock price saw a significant increase in the weeks leading up to the announcement. On the day of the announcement, Apple's stock rose 2.7%, and continued to rise in the following weeks, resulting in a 9% increase in the company's market cap.  Given Apple's track record of producing innovative and groundbreaking products, it is plausible that the rumored VR headset announcement could have a similar effect on the company's stock price. The market may be anticipating a substantial increase in demand for the product, which could translate into higher revenue and earnings for Apple. Additionally, with Apple's reputation for consistently improving upon its products, there is optimism among investors that the VR headset will be well-received and help to solidify Apple's position as a leader in the technology industry.  As a result, there may be market interest in purchasing Apple call options in anticipation of a potential rise in the company's stock price following the announcement. Early indications suggest that Apple's VR headset may contain cutting-edge technology, such as eye-tracking sensors and advanced haptic feedback, which could make it a game-changer in the VR market. If the rumors are true and the product lives up to expectations, Apple's stock price may experience a significant boost in the coming weeks.,;,; 2023-06-01 23:00:58]

[Aapl new VR system might be B2B?,;,; For context, I used to work in the tech industry a couple years ago.  I initially didn‚Äôt understand the pricing for the new VR model. Even if it was a high class high-quality well developed product it just doesn‚Äôt seem to me like the typical consumer can access such a price tag.   However, the business applications of such a device could be extremely lucrative. Production lines could be redefined, the way meetings happened will change, and potentially even B2C interactions could be influenced.  On the gaming side, if it really is as good as it seems to be, we might have an era of the new arcade until pricing drops to a more achievable level.   And then we consider education and the ways the mind could adopt to more complex concepts with the support of such an advanced VR system paired with AI.

[Time to Bet it All on Apple Earnings üçé,;,; Gang, earnings saga continues and AAPL is stepping into the earnings today, after-hours. The Wall Street crystal ball is predicting a slight glow-up in earnings to $1.39 a share from last year's $1.29, despite expecting a tiny dip in revenue to $89.28B from $90.15B. That's about a 1% slip.  AAPL shares are showing off an impressive 32.5% gain this year, riding the high on dope tech and that globally-desired fruit logo. But even with those gains, analysts are side-eyeing AAPL's growth and are thirsty for those numbers to start climbing again.  We're all ears on the current quarter ‚Äì it's the jolly season, so you know it's gotta be good, right? Apple hasn't offered official guidance since 2020, but their money man Maestri might drop some breadcrumbs for us. Hopefully.   **What I'll be paying attention to**  By far, the most important part of the Apple story is still the iPhone, their golden geese - bagging nearly half the sales last quarter even with a slight 2.4% drop to $39.67B. Apple launched new iPhones in September with a lighter, redesigned titanium body, a longer telephoto lens, and a USB-C charging port. So we‚Äôll get our first insight into demand for the new 15's. AAPL's been hyping up their iPhone game, promising a sprint from last quarter with around 49 million of those shiny new toys shipped. While they haven't offered official revenue guidance in several quarters, I'll be looking to hear any directional guidance into year-over-year revenue growth in the iPhone, as well as any disclosures regarding sales at the end of September and into October. Per the latest [Canalys report on worldwide smartphone shipments]( Apple‚Äôs market share was 17% in third-quarter 2023, lagging Samsung‚Äôs 20%.  Artificial intelligence remains a priority across technology earnings reports. I believe Apple will be keen to promote its AI advancements within existing products but will likely keep its future AI ambitions close to the vest. We need to further understand Apple‚Äôs AI efforts in more detail, and see how that might be a revenue driver in the future.   Services are the next leg of meaningful growth for Apple. I still view services as a bit of a lagging indicator, as many of these services are coupled with earlier purchases of Apple hardware. This still isn‚Äôt a bad thing, however, as these services create stickiness to the iOS ecosystem, which underpins Apple‚Äôs wide moat. In addition to iPhone revenue, I'll be interested to hear any commentary around services, particularly with some macroeconomic concerns and the financial health of consumers worldwide. Even as the Google trial in Washington DC highlights how much of that is from Google paying Apple to be the default search engine on iPhones, and puts that reportedly $19 billion per year deal at risk over antitrust. Apple is expected to report $21.42 billion in services revenue, offsetting some weak hardware revenue, and which would be an 11% year-over-year increase.  Now, Macs and iPads might not have everyone's attention this quarter, people are expecting to see a bit of a slump from last year's high. Apple's been straight-up about expecting a "double-digit" percent nosedive there, blaming difficult comparisons to a good quarter in 2022 when sales popped after prior supply issues. That's definitely not good. Apple executives could focus on the fact it just released new MacBooks with chips on Oct. 30 with new chips to stoke more interest?  The mood among analysts, especially in regard to expectations for the fourth quarter, is changing. [Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring]( says that there are four forces working against Apple in the December quarter: An unfavorable comparison, a strong dollar, iPhone supply issues, and a cautious consumer.  ‚ÄúSentiment has turned more challenging for shares of Apple in recent days with increasing concerns around the lower demand for the iPhone 15 Series in China, as well as lackluster consumer spending momentum globally,‚Äù wrote [JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee]( earlier this week in a note to investors.  **China**  One data point from a market research firm [tracking smartphone sales]( suggested that iPhone 15 sales started off slow in China this year. Uh oh. I'm worried that renewed competition from Huawei in China could be making the iPhone less competitive in the company‚Äôs third-largest market. It could show up in Apple‚Äôs future guidance.  ‚ÄúApple does have a China problem. I think when it comes to the phone, my sense is it‚Äôs going to be soft in China for the Sept. quarter,‚Äù [Deepwater Asset Management founder Gene Munster said earlier this week.](  There‚Äôs some disagreement among analysts whether the Huawei competition is a temporary or permanent factor for Apple.  ‚ÄúImportantly, we believe the data suggests increased competition from Huawei in China is likely to be a headwind next year,‚Äù Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang wrote in a note last month.  But like, we all kinda know that the new premium Huawei device is pretty much technologically inferior.  ‚ÄúWe expect Huawei-related pressure on iPhone to be temporary and moderate into FY24 due to significantly outdated chipset on the Mate 60 series,‚Äù he continued.  Throughout the quarter, buzz from the financial grapevine, specifically a piece from the Wall Street Journal, spotlighted China's play to ditch foreign tech within government walls. This move turned heads on Wall Street, sparking chatter about Apple's shifting stars in the East and fanning the flames over whether a surge in national pride or looming regulatory storms might have Chinese customers giving Apple the cold shoulder.  ‚ÄúWith Huawei‚Äôs unexpected launch of Mate 60 Pro and Chinese government‚Äôs ban of using foreign phones for government workers, iPhone market share in China has been a big concern for investors,‚Äù wrote [Citi analyst A. Malik].  **Global iPhone Sales**  In other regions, investors want to know if the iPhone 15 is selling like hotcakes, or if it‚Äôs not moving off store shelves as fast as previous years. Analysts call the strength of any given year‚Äôs iPhone sales the ‚Äúcycle.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe are in the camp that [iPhone 15] is not a good cycle on demand weakness and elongation of replacement cycles,‚Äù [Barclays analyst Tim Long]( wrote.  While analysts track ship times on Apple‚Äôs website and third-party estimates for iPhone sales, there‚Äôs no substitute for color from Apple CEO Tim Cook or sales numbers, either from the week or so the iPhone 15 was on sale in September or through its unofficial guidance for the December quarter.  Another factor is that some analysts are pointing to supply constraints on some iPhones, particularly the higher-end and more expensive ‚ÄúPro‚Äù models which could push some sales out of the December quarter and into the January quarter.  ‚ÄúHowever, we are more cautious on the December quarter given iPhone supply shortages and uneven consumer spending, and believe Apple will guide to a revenue range that is both below normal seasonality and consensus expectations,‚Äù wrote Woodring, the Morgan Stanley guy mentioned earlier.  **Price targets?**  There are quite a few analysts who are long term bullish on the stock.   * [Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives]( reiterated an Outperform rating with a price target of $240 on Nov. 1, 2023.   * [Evercore Group analyst Amit Daryanani]( reiterated an Outperform rating with a price target of $210 on Sept. 28, 2023.  * [UBS analyst David Vogt]( reiterated a Neutral rating with a price target of $190 on Sept. 27, 2023.   But others not so much  * [BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan]( reiterated a Neutral rating with a price target of $173 on Oct. 24, 2023. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 77%.  * [Barclays analyst Tim Long]( maintained an Equal-Weight rating and cut the price target from $167 to $166 on Oct. 30, 2023. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 70%.  All of these analysts are reported to have an accuracy of over 70%.   **What to do for Earnings**  I hate to say it, but given what I've read, it seems like Apple won't be doing too hot. That being said, it's tough to predict a direction when all the professional analysts are fairly 50/50 on the matter. I'm pretty sure last time I did an Apple play, I just got a straddle and ended up being 30% in the profit. However, historically, the company doesn't even move that much with earnings. We're looking at an average of 4.9%. I'd be lying if puts didn't look appealing right now. However, just as a lotto, I'm going to grab some AAPL 11/3 170p at about 80 bucks a pop. Keep in mind, like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play.

[Third time is a charm? Nearing the End - long post,;,;  I haven't posted here in awhile mostly because I havent had much to say. But I think the next couple of weeks will be interesting. I hate people who waffle so here's what I am saying in case you don't want to read the long post: the VIX is going higher and the market is going lower and there is already evidence the house of cards is teetering.  I am not going to discuss the terrible breadth in the market, or what the VIX is actually signaling the market will do in the next couple of months (move in a 1% range), or the fact that we are being invaded at our southern border, or that the market returns are largely due to five stocks, or that CMG has a PE of 55, Salesforce 961 PE, Zoom 187, NVDA 162, or that earnings were terrible if you remove cost cutting measures etc. None of that matters either apparently.  # When will this tight range end?  Way back in February, I posted somewhat jokingly that what would drive everyone nuts is if the SP500 pinned itself to the 4000 level. Here we are in June and thats effectively what its done. I've posted about my frustration, my bewilderment and then my conviction that when it does break, it will be to the downside.  Whats important is not to take one or two data points and then deduct a result that is full of confirmation bias. However, I believe we are close - like next two weeks close - to this market being able to break out of this range.  A couple of points (thanks again to my expat genius on Twitter @/frankoz95967943 who learned me the very complex details of this) - all of these I have discussed at length in posts on my sub):  1. VIX is being suppressed artificially. I have covered how in previous posts. Simplest way to know is to look at HYG. It normally correlates. Not anymore. 2. Oil is also being suppressed. Again, if oil rises, everything else rises in price. The Fed does not want inflation. Best way to fight inflation is to keep oil down. I've shared how they are doing this in previous posts. (links at the end) 3. The Japanese are the major fbuddy helping the Fed do all of this.  I have to tell you that in +30 years in the market managing assets, I have not seen a market like this before. It is unnatural and controlled. That's why the VIX keeps dropping when risk keeps rising. I have posted at great length about the outlier risks that currently exist (Ukraine, banks, etc.) so no need to get into that again.  # WHY IS IT DIFFERENT NOW?  So a couple of things have happened and a couple are scheduled to happen that have caused me to go out on a limb and say this: what the Fed can control is limited and the end is near. Yes, the Fed can print money ad infinitum, like they have been doing, and the Japanese can play their role, but at some point, outside events will occur that they cannot control. Even with the help of the devil, I mean Jamie Dimon and JPM.  Here is what has happened recently:  # TRIGGER #1: OIL being manipulated is close to being out of US hands:  1. As I postulated earlier, because the US keeps hammering down the price of oil, eventually those countries whose GDP is based on oil might decide they've had enough. Well, OPEC+ is communicating they've had enough.    1. [Saudi Minister Says OPEC+ Could Cut Production At Any Time | OilPrice.com]( 2. Then there is this: [Iraq And Iran Ignore U.S. Sanctions In Talks To Expand Energy Ties | OilPrice.com]( 3. There this: [Syria‚Äôs normalization signals a new Middle Eastern order (brookings.edu)]( &lt;----- Let's not forget that Assad is a war criminal. So bad that the Arab league suspended Syria's membership in 2011.    1. Of course, the NeoCons in the US govt respond by doing this: [US lawmakers introduce bill to combat normalization with Syria's Assad (yahoo.com)](  The Middle East seems to be getting MORE peaceful, not less, Israel excluded of course. Why? I think its because they see that they have a shot at gaining more control over their regional politics AND perhaps a chance to wean themselves off of the US dollar dependance.  If the price of oil is allowed to trade freely, its going up. Period. If the price of oil goes up, inflation goes up.  # RESULT: If oil goes up, inflation goes up, and then the Fed will truly lose control.  # TRIGGER #2: DEBT CEILING TALKS  Lots of news lately about the debt ceiling. Of course the debt ceiling would not be a problem if the US just spent LESS but thats a moot point since thats not going to happen. I don't know if the US will default, probably not a full default anyway. BUT, the mere appearance of the possibility of the US defaulting will cause risk assets to plummet.  1. [Biden and Hill leaders postpone debt meeting as deal talks continue - POLITICO]( 2. [McCarthy was 'disrespectful' in Biden meeting on debt limit, sources say (nbcnews.com)]( \- what a bunch of children. 3. [McCarthy blasts Biden after White House debt ceiling meeting (axios.com)](  Look, they will raise the debt ceiling at some point. The question is how long it will take and who will blink first. However, the longer it takes, the more nervous the markets become.  Don't forget this too: ***The Treasury General Account fell to $154 billion, down from $184 billion on May 9th. In fact, at this rate, the account will be EMPTY on May 19th. OPEX.***  Don't be fooled by the chatter of deals and more deals. Yes, a deal will get done but the point is the SP500 is not trading like there is any concern.  # RESULT: The empty TGA will force the US government to RAISE rates it offers to investors to fund operations. Raising rates is bad for the market.  # TRIGGER #3: SHORT SELLING BAN on bank stocks.  Beyond the hypocrisy of this, compounded by the fact that other than Yellen, the main spokesperson trumpeting this idea is the devil, I mean Jamie Dimon, is the fact that the last time they did this in 2008 after Lehman, 3 months later the XLF was down 51%.  1. [JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon wants US regulators to consider a ban on the short selling of bank stocks | Business Insider India]( 2.

TREASURY SECRETARY YELLEN TO MEET TOP BANK CEOS NEXT WEEK IN WASHINGTON: POLITICO &lt;---- prob to discuss the $18b they are going to force on the banks to recapitalize the bank insurance fund. 5. Discussions of raising the FDIC limit to infinity &lt;--- this is bank nationalization or rather, JPM et al.  # RESULT: A BAN WILL ONLY OCCUR IF ANOTHER BANK IS ABOUT TO FAIL - this is the only reason. IF IT OCCURS, BYE BYE MARKET.  # TRIGGER #4: MONEY IS LEAVING AAPL.  AAPL is close to an all time high. As AAPL goes so goes the market. AAPL's earnings S U C K E D unless you are a fan of gains due to outsourcing of labor overseas. Also, Foxconn, AAPL's largest supplier, reported a 56% drop in net income ( [Apple supplier Foxconn's Q1 profit plunges, outlook "conservative" | Reuters]( ). Oh and Samsung Electronics profit fell 95% in first quarter. But yeah, AAPL is fine.  But while the stock is going up, money is leaving:  1. 2 billion left the stock May 5    1. Money flowed in May 10th 2. Then this past Friday, 7 billion - and no its not repositioning or some other reason.    ***Since Jan 1, AAPL has added $760,000,000,000 in market cap. Sure, that makes sense.***  # RESULT: AAPL rolling over will pull the techs and the rest of the market down.  # All it will take is FOR ONE OF THE ABOVE THINGS TO HAPPEN and the market goes down.  # But wait, thats not all. Here are some possible "canaries in the coal mine":  # The VVIX, which is the volatility of the VIX, is going UP when the VIX is being manipulated going down. HUH?  1. The UAE announced a $10 billion short position on US stocks last week. What's odd is how public this announcement was.    1. I believe this was another warning to Washington to knock off their manipulation of the oil markets.    2. Our government responded 2 days later that they would start buying to refill the markets in June. What?? Why would you communicate when you will buy in the open markets? The US has publicly stated they will only buy when oil is $67-$72 per barrel. Either the US thinks thats where oil will be or they are communicating to OPEC+ (the + is for Russia) that they will be done screwing around in June.  # OTHER RISK BEING IGNORED:  1. US Banks - not any better regardless of what Yellen and JP and the devil say. There is a structural problem with regional banks: they cannot compete unless they take on more risk and that has led to them taking on more risk which is why the banking system is set to collapse - collapse into a national banking system, run by the devil of course. I am not a conspiracy theorist - if you understand how much money the TBTF banks are getting for less than 1% from the Fed, you understand that regionals dont have a chance. 2. Ukraine - there is still a war going on. People are dying. The US public is done caring about Ukraine having moved on to better things. 3. China / Taiwan - probably not this summer since Taiwan is going to be having an election in 2024 and if the KMT party wins, unification, i mean war is called off: China wins, without a single shot being fired.

Other items of interest are credit card chargeoffs higher than 2008 levels, rising auto loan delinquencies, poor tax collections, layoffs, BBBY bankruptcy (this would've normally crashed the market for a day or so due to their large real estate holdings). But yeah, there's no inflation.  # And really, the big data point to me that proves without a doubt the VIX is being manipulated is the following chart which shows that normally, like the last 15 years, when yields move higher, the VIX moves higher (historical R [correlation] of 71.21%). But not this time I guess. VIX is purple, Yields are green.    # CONCLUSION:All it will take is for one card to fall in this humongous house of cards. And I only listed a couple of them.

[Crayon Drawings for Impending Sell Off,;,; After 500mg of caffeine and a 20-minute meditation, I felt particularly "artistic" and decided to doodle on charts with crayons. In this post, I will examine, in my opinion, the seven most important signals of the market: SPX (S&amp;P), QQQ (NASDAQ), IWM (Russel), DIA( Dow Jones), VIX (Volatility Index), AAPL (Apple), and MFST (Microsoft).  Starting off with SPX, we can see that it has broken out of its long-term downtrend MOAT (Mother of all trends) and even broke out of its February down trend. Currently, it appears to be in "no man's land," with the biggest form of resistance coming from the previous high in February. I personally see no reason for SPX to start pushing up above the February high, but if anyone has a reasonable explanation as to why it might, I am all ears. The RSI (Relative strength index) is at 62.58, and, as demonstrated by the white horizontal line, just about every time it gets to this area, it is followed by a significant decline. Looking at the MACD (Moving average convergence divergence), we can see that the histogram is in positive territory as well as the MACD line. However, it appears to be turning over and going to the downside. Keep in mind this is in the daily time frame.  [\[SPX\]](  Next, looking at QQQ, we can see that it is beginning to stall as it is in extremely overbought territory. The MACD line has passed the signal line, and it is CLEAR that downside momentum is beginning. Since QQQ already went above its February high, the next high it would have to overtake is from August of 2022, which is roughly 5% from current prices. I personally do not think this rally makes sense considering the state of AAPL and MSFT which I analyze down below. Together, both stocks comprise roughly a quarter of QQQ.  &amp;#x200B;  [QQQ](  Similar to SPX, DIA has broken through MOAT and it heading toward the February high. However, it is in overbought conditions. I don't see a melt up from here and I think it is about to fall with the rest of the indexes. Maybe it pushes a little higher and then it is in for the reckoning.  &amp;#x200B;  [DIA](  Here's where it gets a bit confusing for me, and any explanation is welcome. IWM looks like it is ready to pop. It is definitely "the canary in the Cole mine". It is oversold and on the MACD, and the looks like it is heading up on the RSI as well. It looks like it has room to run to the upper end of the trend line (shown in yellow). Maybe QQQ and SPX go on to drop while IWM pops but something tells me they are going to move in harmony.  &amp;#x200B;  [\[IWM\]](  The VIX is currently at 17.07. The VIX usually spikes with earnings, which are right around the corner. Additionally, it appears to be forming a bullish divergence.  &amp;#x200B;  [\[VIX\]](  Do I even need to explain? I mean, if you had to take a guess... where do you think it is AAPL is going? AAPL makes up 7.08% of SPX and 12.43% of QQQ.  &amp;#x200B;  [\[AAPL\]](  Finally, looking at Microsoft, it is trading right at its August high, with no catalyst to push it above this point. Microsoft comprises 12.68% of QQQ and 6.2% of SPY.  [MSFT](  In conclusion: everything looks like it is about to sell off. I am extremely bearish. I do not know \*when\* the sell off will begin, but I think it is wise to average into SPXS or SQQQ as current conditions present downside. In light of economic conditions, I find it difficult to believe that we are not going to be experiencing an earnings recession that would serve as a catalyst to the downside coming off of extremely overbought conditions.,;,; 2023-04-16 04:09:03]

[Oxy is the most undervalued company based on FCF yield on EV in the market right now.,;,; FCF yield on EV(enterprise value) is 14.66% and Operating CF on EV is 21.7%. This means that if you have 69 Billions to buy Oxy with net 0 cash and debt, after 6.8 years you will have 69 Billions in your bank account. This disregards the value their yearly 1.4B capex will generate.  Using 3.13% FCF yield on EV of AAPL for comparison.

Oxy is at the forefront of Direct Air Carbon Capture (DACC) technology. BlackRock has already invested $550m and Amazon is currently working on a contract.

[DD: Scary Fast to a Recession Next Year,;,; # Introduction  Obvious Note: This post is not financial advice. Quite honestly, I'm not even sure how solid this thought process is, and am open to contrarian views to my own.  **tl:dr:** AAPL averted crisis for now, but I think that the Scary Fast event was done out of real fear, and it means that a correction will come by EoQ12024 for QQQ and possibly SPY - trust me, this makes sense, please read.  I actually had puts on AAPL for the last few weeks, and the Scary Fast event basically wrecked my Puts for earnings week, so take the research and opinions below with this bias in mind.  # Tim can Cook: Pivoting back to the 30Day Mean  Right before earnings (Oct26), it looked as if AAPL was going to continuously breach the lower end of its 30day 2St.D. Bollinger Band: for amateur Astrologists like myself, this is often a pattern that we see when the market believes that there is going to be a massive downside correction to a stock's price, as upside price movements often come smoothly ("escalator up, elevator down").  It wasn't only the chart, the stories in the news also agrees:  1. Apple facing massive risk over its China supply chain due to Foxconn being audited by the CCP: [ 2. Apple's sales of Macs shrinking YoY: [ 3. Apple's bread and butter (iPhone) facing increased risks in both its largest overseas market (Greater China area), due to breakthroughs by Huawei on new chips made by SMIC (China's domestic semiconductor manufacturer) affecting demand: [  Given this, Apple's price has gone all the way from its ATH of \~$196.45 on Jul31st, to breaching below 200DMA and below 30Day bollinger band: \~$166.89 on Oct26th.  Seeing both the ink on the newspapers and the crayons on the stock chart, Tim then ControlledTheNarrative (haaaa, I hope he's doing ok tho) and made everyone prepare for a product announcement event right before earnings - fuck them employees being able to spend time with their kids on costumes amirite?  The thing is: it worked.  # Scaring the Bears on Halloween  The event addressed the fears of investors with the following announcements, directly targeting the news points above:  1. The new M3 chip, and its increased speed and capabilities (assuaging fear 3): Although these chips only are hitting the new Macs now, we all know that Apples' chip improvements will eventually reach all of its products. (source: [ 2. new MacBook Pros with said M3 chip (assuaging fear 2): Not only did Apple directly strike at the investors' worry of lagging Mac sales, they also made it a fashion statement by creating a new, cool, modern color for it. This move will ensure that demand will be high for those who treat Apple products as a status symbol, as they have done for the iPhone in the past. (source: [  However, just to be safe (these are all according to Ming-Chi Kuo):  1. Apple has long been working on a iPhone SE 4: [ 2. 2024 budget MacBook is currently under consideration: [ 3. Apple is also working on an AirPods 4, which is going to be budget-friendly: [  *\*\*\*These three points are important, and we're going to circle back to that in a bit.\*\*\**  # The Market Helps Those Who Help Themselves  But the event was a massive success. In the week before earnings, Apple reverted upwards from $166.89 to $177.57, and only went down to $176.65 after earnings. Apple deserves that dub and I hope they take it to the bank as quickly as they made that event.  To Eiffel Tower the bears even more, Jerome Powell, coincidentally armed with an iPad just \~a month prior, announced that there will not be a rate hike, contributing to Apple's valuation boner above.  However, my bet is that it won't last.  # Apple's History: Reaching Down During Bad Times  Note how in the 3 points above regarding the iPhone SE4, MB, and AirPods 4, Apple is reaching down to the budget market. Historically, Apple has only done that when they smell trouble:  1. iPhone 5c was released in Sep2013    1. AAPL dropped from \~$26 to a low of \~$15 from Sept2012 to July2013    2. QQQ was at \~$68.23 in Apr2012, and did not exceed that consistently until Apr2013 2. iPhone SE was released Mar2016    1. AAPL dropped from \~$33 to a low of \~$23 from May2015 to Mar2016    2. QQQ was at \~$114 at Jul2015, and did not exceed that consistently until Jul2016 3. iPhone SE2 was released right at the start of the pandemic, and the stock would've seen action similar to above had PapaPowell'sPrinter and his trusty iPad hadn't snipped our currency with his printer ala Nero. 4. iPhone SE3 released in Mar2022, right when the post-printer correction was beginning to happen.    1. AAPL dropped from \~$182 from Jan2022, and did not exceed that until Jun2023.    2. QQQ was at ATH in Jan2022, and was at post-pandemic low by Jan2023.  Apple is now doing iPhone SE4, new entry-level MB, new budget airpods all in 2024. I have no idea what breakfast Apple's economists eat, but if Apple's product rumors are any indication, we will be in more economic pain in the months to come.  # My Guess For the Future  *Side note: S&amp;P500 does not have +6% weeks during real bull markets.

No, to be honest, I think options are overpriced in general right now and I don't want to short stock or sell naked calls, but if I had to make target prices right now, it's going to be:  AAPL \~$170 target price by EoY, with more corrections to come in 2024.  SPY &lt;$400 by EoY, again with more downside in 2024.  QQQ &lt;$345 by EoY, and you guessed it, more downside in 2024.

[$TSLA to 12 trillion AI DD inside,;,; ChatGPT said so:  TLDR: As of September 2021, Tesla's market cap was around $750 billion, and Apple's (highest market cap in the world) was around $2.4 trillion, making Tesla's market cap about 31.25% of Apple's. Around late 2007 or early 2008, Apple's market cap was approximately 31% of Exxon Mobil's (highest market cap in the world - at that time). Apple's market cap has grown by an estimated 1,500% since 2007. If Tesla's market cap were to grow by the same percentage, its future market cap would hypothetically **be around $12 trillion.**    Q: What's the most recent stock price data you have?  A: As an AI language model, I don't have real-time data access or any data beyond September 2021. To obtain the most recent stock price information, please refer to financial news websites, brokerage platforms, or financial market data providers such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or Bloomberg.  Q: As of your most recent data: 1) what is the market cap of tesla?  2) What is the market cap of tesla as a ratio compared to aapl's market cap?  A: As of my most recent data in September 2021:  1. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) had a market capitalization of around $700 billion - $800 billion. Please note that this figure may have changed significantly since then. To get the current market cap, please check a reliable financial data source. 2. Apple Inc. (AAPL) had a market capitalization of around $2.4 trillion in September 2021. To calculate the ratio of Tesla's market cap to Apple's market cap at that time, you would divide Tesla's market cap by Apple's market cap. Using the approximate numbers provided:  (Tesla's market cap) / (Apple's market cap) = ($700 - $800 billion) / ($2.4 trillion)  Keep in mind that these figures are outdated and the ratio could be very different now. To get the most recent market cap data and ratio, please refer to an up-to-date financial data source.  Q: what does ($700 - $800 billion) / ($2.4 trillion) equal?  A: I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. To clarify, Tesla's market capitalization was between $700 billion and $800 billion, while Apple's was around $2.4 trillion. To find the approximate ratio, we can use the average of Tesla's market cap range:  ($700 billion + $800 billion) / 2 = $750 billion  Now, we can calculate the ratio:  (Tesla's market cap) / (Apple's market cap) = ($750 billion) / ($2.4 trillion)  Since 1 trillion equals 1,000 billion, we can convert Apple's market cap to billions:  ($750 billion) / (2,400 billion) ‚âà 0.3125  So, the ratio of Tesla's market cap to Apple's market cap was approximately 0.3125 or 31.25% based on the data from September 2021. Please note that these figures are outdated, and the ratio could be very different now. To get the most recent market cap data and ratio, please refer to an up-to-date financial data source.  Q: using historical data, 1) when was aapl's market cap ratio 31% compared to the most highest market cap company at that time?  2) what year and prices were they  A: It's challenging to pinpoint the exact date and price when Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) market cap was 31% of the highest market cap company at the time without access to an extensive historical database. However, I can provide a rough estimate based on available information.  In the mid-to-late 2000s, Exxon Mobil (XOM) was often the largest publicly traded company by market capitalization. Around the end of 2007 and the beginning of 2008, Apple's market cap was approximately $150-$160 billion, while Exxon Mobil's market cap was around $500 billion.  Using these approximate values, we can calculate the ratio:  (Apple's market cap) / (Exxon Mobil's market cap) = ($150-$160 billion) / ($500 billion) ‚âà 0.30-0.32 or 30-32%  This suggests that Apple's market cap ratio was roughly 31% compared to Exxon Mobil in late 2007 or early 2008. Note that these are rough estimates, and the actual ratio may have varied slightly. Also, the share prices and market cap values might have been different on the exact day the ratio was 31%. For more accurate historical data, I recommend consulting financial databases or historical stock market records.  Q: what percentage gain in market cap has aapl experienced since 2007 compared to it's value in your most recent data?  What would TSLA's market cap be if it grew from it's present 750 billion market by that same % of growth in the future?  A: As of my most recent data in September 2021, Apple Inc. (AAPL) had a market capitalization of around $2.4 trillion. To provide an estimate of the percentage gain in market cap since 2007, let's use the approximate market cap of $150 billion from the end of 2007 as the starting point.  Percentage gain = ((Current market cap - Market cap in 2007) / Market cap in 2007) \* 100  Percentage gain ‚âà (($2,400 billion - $150 billion) / $150 billion) \* 100 ‚âà 1,500%  Now, let's use the average Tesla Inc. (TSLA) market cap value of $750 billion from my previous response and calculate what its market cap would be if it experienced the same percentage growth as AAPL:  Future market cap = Current market cap \* (1 + (Percentage gain / 100))  Future market cap = $750 billion \* (1 + (1,500% / 100)) = $750 billion \* (1 + 15) = $750 billion \* 16 ‚âà $12,000 billion or $12 trillion  If Tesla's market cap were to grow by the same 1,500% as Apple's did from 2007 to September 2021, its market cap would be approximately $12 trillion. Please note that this is a hypothetical scenario, and there's no guarantee that Tesla or any other company will experience the same growth rate as Apple.  &amp;#x200B;  Thank you for coming to my TedTalk,;,; 2023-04-13 03:16:48]

[Market Outlook 10/25/2023,;,; **Recap On This Tuesday‚Äôs Market Action:**  * SPY closed up 0.75% * QQQ closed up 0.97% * Dow Jones Industrial closed up 0.62% * VIX closed down 6.88%  Good evening everyone, I hope you all have had an excellent and productive Tuesday! Today we saw the major indices pop at the open and trade relatively flat throughout the day closing only slightly higher than the open. There are major earnings reports being released this week so it will be interesting to see how the market reacts to these reports.    SPY gapped up from its close on Monday and appears to be starting to bounce off of the 200 day EMA (white line). SPY did however undercut the recent low set earlier this month. The bounce off of the 200 day EMA coupled with the hopefully positive earning reports this week may help push SPY higher. However, as always, we cannot predict the future. If earnings are weaker than expected SPY may take a sharp dive below the 200 day EMA.    QQQ is still well above its 200 day EMA. However, we still did see an undercut of the earlier October lows yesterday. This week‚Äôs earnings will definitely impact the tech heavy NASDAQ as Microsoft ($MSFT) and Alphabet ($GOOGL) reported after today‚Äôs close and Meta ($META), IBM ($IBM), Amazon ($AMZN), and Intel ($INTL) report later this week. As with SPY, if earnings are worse than expected we may see a quick drop to the 200 day EMA.  **GOLD List Stocks:**    AAPL is behaving quite nicely given the recent market action. While it has been trending downward since the beginning of August, AAPL is holding up better than many others. If the overall market picks up and AAPL reports positive earnings next week, we could see a break of the recent October highs of $183.    AMZN has a very similar story to AAPL. AMZN is still above the previous October lows and may test the 50 day EMA if earnings come out positive.    GOOGL has been steadily trending upward over the past few months. GOOGL reported earnings today and as of writing this is now down 6.49% in after hours trading. It is important to keep in mind that after hours price moves do not always translate into the next day trading session.    META has seemed to have had a stall in price movement since mid July. The 8 and 21 day EMA‚Äôs are very close together and the 50 day EMA has continued to plateau. Earnings come out tomorrow after the close.    MSFT has stayed close to its October high and seems to be bouncing off of the 8 day EMA. MSFT reported earnings after hours today and is currently gapping up around 5%. Again, this may not translate into the trading session tomorrow.    NVDA has been range trading from $400 to $500 since mid June. NVDA does not report earnings till the end of Novemeber but will likely be heavily influenced by other companies and the overall market. I opened a starter position in NVDA today as it took out the little base that formed halfway through last week.    TSLA reported earnings last week and gapped down heavily. Price seems to have come to rest on the 200 day EMA for now. TSLA also has a multi year downward sloping trendline, shown in yellow. The last time price came near this line it was rejected heavily. If TSLA is able to rally to this trendline it will take a lot of buying power to overcome it.  **Bringing everything together:**  For now, the market seems to be catching its breath after heavy selling at the end of last week. However, there are several big earnings reports coming out which may push the market in one direction or the other. While there may be a number of stocks with valid setups, it would be wise to err on the side of caution until the majority of earnings reports have been released.  As always feel free to reach out with any questions or comments!,;,; 2023-10-24 23:04:06]

[What I'm doing for PLTR earnings tonight,;,; Today after-hours, Palantir is reporting latest earnings. Analysts are predicting earnings of $0.040 per share compared to earnings of $0.020 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. They're also expecting the company to report $505.8 million, an increase of 13.32% over the prior year quarter. Looking at the full year, analysts expect a profit of $0.207 per share. In the previous year there was a profit of $0.060 per share.  Over the last 2 years, PLTR has beaten EPS estimates 50% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 100% of the time. Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 4 upward revisions and 3 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 1 upward revision and 7 downward.  The data intelligence software company in mid February reported Q4 2022 results that beat estimates on both top- and bottom-line. The company also [forecasted]( 2023 to be its first year of profitability, sending its shares higher by more than 20%. I do expect the company to move towards sustainable operating profitability, especially with the recently announced [expansion]( of the company's cloud partnership with Microsoft (MSFT), which opens up a new revenue source.  However, PLTR shares have struggled since the company's strong Q4 report, having fallen about 20% up till their last close. In addition to this, the company in late February joined the string of technology firms that announced layoffs amid an economic slowdown. PLTR said it would reduce its workforce by around 2% in an effort to reduce costs. However, this isn't necessarily bad news.  Citi on Thursday said PLTR is likely to keep dealing with challenges posed by "incremental commercial headwinds," despite "resilient" spending from the federal government.  **What to do for earnings?**  PLTR has moved on average 4% with earnings, but with a large standard deviation. I don't think there's sufficient news to predict whether it'll go up or down with any degree of confidence. However, due to low strike prices, options are really cheap. I'm picking up 5/12 8p at 58 bucks a pop. If the stock were to drop 4%, that wouldn't be a big enough move to deem the puts profitable. However, I'm treating this as a lotto play, hoping for a larger move downward; while not exactly 'expecting' it.

Bear thesis:  * Nancy  might have already sold her calls, but we will only hear about it after 30 days when she files that form. * Companies with similar cap typically have a revenue of hundreds billions, while NVDA's revenue of last quarter is only 18 billions. * Currently price level already priced in a great earnings. Anything short of a GOAT earning could result in a selloff. * A few tech companies beat earnings this week but still the stock tanked. * r/wallstreetbets's general sentiment is bullish on the stock, which means it's time to inverse.

[Google, Amazon, and Unity are among the tech companies implementing layoffs to start 2024,;,; Google, Amazon, and Unity are among the tech companies implementing layoffs to start 2024, echoing trends observed in 2023. Tech firms persist in cost-cutting, efficiency improvement, and adapting to a cooling labor market. The U.S. unemployment rate stands at 3.7%, a near 50-year low, yet recent months have seen a slowdown in job gains. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employers added 105,000 workers in October, 173,000 in November, and 216,000 in December, below the 2023 monthly average of 225,000.   Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) confirmed on Thursday that it is laying off hundreds of staff across its voice assistant, hardware, and engineering teams. A Google spokesperson mentioned organizational changes, including role eliminations globally, aligning with product priorities.  Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman are reportedly leaving the company after Google's $2.1B acquisition in 2021, amidst competition with the Apple (AAPL) Watch. Alphabet also made several cuts in 2023, including an announcement in January to eliminate roughly 12,000 jobs.  Unity Software (NYSE:U) announced a 25% staff cut this week, aiming to restructure and refocus its core business for long-term and profitable growth. Approximately 1,800 employees are impacted, with the company unable to reasonably estimate costs associated with the reduction until the first quarter of 2024. Despite revenue growth, Unity has struggled to turn a profit, leading to a 20% decline in shares over the past six months.  Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to cut several hundred employees in its media units, including Prime Video and MGM Studios. Reports suggest a 35% reduction in the Twitch workforce, affecting around 500 workers, and a 5% cut in the Audible workforce. Like tech counterpart Alphabet, Amazon made various employment cuts in the previous year.  Xerox (NASDAQ:XRX) announced a 15% reduction in its workforce in the first quarter of this year as part of a restructuring plan. The plan focuses on improving and stabilizing the core print business, increasing productivity through a new Global Business Services organization, and directing Digital Services and IT Services capabilities towards more profitable markets. This restructuring follows a 6% year-over-year decline in third-quarter sales.,;,; 2024-01-14 15:16:45]

[Went long QQQ calls today. I feel very dirty.,;,; I had to hold my nose and buy some QQQ calls.  The world cental banks injected $1 Trillion in liquidity and if I have learned something over the decades of trading, do not fight the Fed.  While I am confidant that the world is not saved, as is evident from my CRE post, I also remember 2008 when Bear Stearns went belly up in March but it took the summer and part of the Fall until Lehman went under.  Of course, the DOJ also sued two of Bear's hedge funds in August so that helped.  The chance of the DOJ suing any investment bank or bank this time around is 1%.  I mean, they just backstopped them, again.  **Other contributing factors to my QQQ long position:**  1. Hedge Funds and CTA's are still overwhelmingly bearish according to multiple reports from Government Sachs, the devil (JPM) and others. 2. QQQ is in a technical bull market now.  I don't argue with charts. 3. There's still that $1 trillion I mentioned up above that is supposed to stabilize deposit bases.  And after 2008 the largest banks who received their bailouts, promised to lend that money out.  They didn't - they put it in risk assets - stocks.  But sure, this time they will do as they say. 4. Hedgies are short overwhelmingly, to the tune of $28 billion SPX futures that they need to cover in April. 5. Seasonality as shown by the attached graphic. 6. Perfect conditions for a short squeeze on the NDX which is nowhere near overbought.  **HOWEVER, there are just as many worrisome data points:**  1. Since Dec 28, 50% of the gain in NDX has been from 5 stocks NVDA, AAPL, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA META.  Sorry, that's very.  See #2 2. From the graphic, earnings are now expected to drop 12% yoy from last year.  Not good if you are a fundamental investor. 3. There WILL be more bad news from the banking sector.  Might be a private HF or private REIT, but this is a no brainer. 4. The Fed apparently only really wanted to get the market through the end of this quarter bc how much news have you heard from them about regulatory enforcement?  NONE.  Why? Because if they hadn't, can you freaking imagine what some of these large banks would be reporting. 5. EOQ is the time for mutual funds and all to "paint the tape."  They sell the stocks that have rec'd bad press (banks) and buy the stocks that have rec'd good press (NVDA et al.)  Translation: HF chasing over the last 3 weeks has led to the NDX advance which has held the SPX up. 6. If the tech sector is so hot, then why have so many LARGE layoffs been announced?  And the layoffs are broad: META  -11,000; GOOGL - 12,0000; AMZN-distribution labor - 9000; Indeed - 2200 - uhm, job search site, WMT-layoffs from warehouse to distribution.  And then the one I think is hilarious are the 1400 from McKinsey and Co -who are usually the ones doing the layoffs.  BTW, perhaps the easiest metric to use to know if the NDX run is over?  AAPL.  Pull up a chart.  Lately its been leading the market.  Finally, despite being "forced" into a long QQQ position, I also put on a long VIX position today.  I mean, cmon - look at the daily chart.  I hate it, I think its a joke, but I will not fight the Fed.  I hope the market elevates so I can get short at higher levels. I remain short CMBS, COIN, and CLX.  Long VIX and other "story" plays.  Thanks.     2023-03-30 23:50:36]

[BIG WEEK AHEAD,;,; We have Fed speak and six significant earnings reports with forward guidance this coming week.  My thoughts:  JPOW &amp; Committee has no reason at all to do six rate cuts this year so far.  Too bad - the economy would boom otherwise.  He won‚Äôt declare victory and most likely will remain cautious.  I think the market needs to get over the Fed and move on.      Tuesday the fun begins:  MSFT -  red hot!   The tunes are full blast - can they dance?   They have three businesses to report on plus AI.  Microsoft 365, Asure cloud, &amp; personal computing- XBOX, Bing, Surface, and Activision.  Their yoy earnings is expected to increase 19%.  They been pushing AI close to two years now - show me the money!  Would like to see  yoy revenue growth of at least 25% based on their price. I think they are over bought.    GOOGL -  is expected to grow earnings by 53% to roughly $ 1.61.  Let‚Äôs see how search and YouTube does.  Maybe they have a new AI story to tell.  Over bought I think.     AMD -  is expected to grow earnings by 12% to roughly $0.77.   It‚Äôll be about forward guidance I believe.   I like what I hear about the 8000G processors with lower power graphics and innovative content creation capabilities.   They have a strong story as well with their neural processing unit(NPU) Ryzen A for PC‚Äôs. Over bought but will continue to kick ass I think.  Thursday:  AAPL - is expected to grow earnings 12% with flat yoy revenue.  Really don‚Äôt see any surprise to the upside.  Heard the Apple Pro Vision isn‚Äôt gaining any app‚Äôs on Netflix‚Äôs.    Really no growth story so far.  Sell.   AMZN -big Q upcoming.   They need to demonstrate they can make big money.  They are expected to grow earnings from $0.03 to 0.79/share.  Use them a lot - we‚Äôll see.  Meta - expected to grow earnings by 66% to $5 roughly.  Meta plans to have 350,000 Nvidia H100 chips to drive its data centers &amp; AI by end of 2024. Year of efficiency is over I think.     I‚Äôm hoping for a flat week, but do have puts on MSFT &amp; APPL.   My opinion only.   Your thoughts!,;,; 2024-01-28 05:28:20]

[I am bullish on $CHYNA,;,; First off, let me say that I clearly understand how bad China stocks have been since their peak in 2021. Not only have they come out of the pandemic at an anemic growth rate, the housing crisis, corrupt government, and the list goes on have been very large headwinds.  However, when a stock is trading at 10x PE and still growing at 15% YoY without even touching their AI capabilities, I think a lot of these mega cap China stocks are a steal at these prices.  1. Sentiment is at an all time low. Literally everyone is done with China stocks and refuses to buy them 2. Hedge funds have been piling in since the beginning of the year when $BABA was at $67 and $BIDU was st $98 3. Chinas downturn has likely already happened and the growth story will be back by the end of the year 4. $BIDU has a 10 year floor at $90-100. If it breaks below that, it‚Äôs game over but until then, this is a massive floor to buy at 5. $BABA is at IPO price and has grown revenue 10x since then. Really??   I‚Äôm show their are even more contrarian and value indicators to look at but I‚Äôm convinced. I‚Äôm holding 100s of shares of commons in each and $20k in leap calls across both names. They may not reach their peak in 21‚Äô anytime soon but I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre a safe 50-100% gain from here with patience.  My last point is look at mega cap tech stocks in Oct. 22‚Äô. Don‚Äôt you wish you bought $META $TSLA at $90? $AAPL at $120? $AMZN $GOOG at $80? This feels like that same chance.  Let me know your thoughts in the comments!,;,; 2024-02-01 05:25:16]

[Bearish on $ARM,;,; I want to be bullish on ARM but something I just read changed my mind. ‚ÄúAfter the IPO, SoftBank will still hold 90% of ARM shares‚Äù ‚Äúthey tried selling ARM for $40B to NVDA in 2022‚Ä¶.   This means that the IPO will open 20-30% higher than what SoftBank wanted for the company.  On top of this they are down heavy on other positions and may sacrifice ARM to make up for their lack of performance in the last half decade. I canceled my order for a few IPO shares and will wait. Love the company nervous about the institutional holders. This isn‚Äôt owned by a rational investment bank‚Ä¶.   Lastly the analyst from NEW STREET, name is Pierre Feragu recently put a $59 PT on arm to build hype in the IPO. Guess what other company he recommends with a strong BUY? SOFTBANK. He has a neutral on AMD and AAPL possibly because they are not in his best interests. Something stinks, I‚Äôm probably wrong I usually am but I will wait to enter ARM. Either I‚Äôm buying puts if it skyrockets or will buy shares if it drops below a 40B valuation   -GAPE Capital DD,;,; 2023-09-13 23:54:50]

[$PYPL Ad: Six innovations that will revolutionize commerce,;,; The title says it all‚ÄîI noticed $PYPL promoting this ad campaign, "Six Innovations That Will Revolutionize Commerce." I hope they don't just mention AI six times and call it a day, lol, but it looks pretty promising to me, not just event-wise, but also regarding the stock price for the long run based on valuations.  I think gay bears are pushing prices down, anticipating a further decrease probably, as they profit more from options premiums and engage in reverse plays. The put/call ratio is 0.27 (bullish). Additionally, I've observed negative news and analyst downgrades. Personally, I disregard analysts' upgrades and downgrades. While analysts may often dismiss it as a dead-end company, I recall similar sentiments for META last year, and now it has reached an all-time high. Similarly, analysts had a similar stance on $AAPL last week, and now it's back to $194 from $182. However, I believe $PYPL is an undervalued stock that I favor. It operates in a competitive business, yet it exhibits steady revenue growth.  In my opinion, it's a great stock. Will it skyrocket and provide returns like your big green candle $NVDA and other AI stocks? Definitely not.

[What Company Do You Think Is Least Likely to be Doing ‚ÄúInsider Trading‚Äù?,;,; TL;DR: Which company(s) do you think are least likely to participate in insider trading? My guess; less than you‚Äôd think.   Just started writing indicators with Pine Script, and I need a null hypothesis. In order to accomplish this, I want to harness the power of the degenerate and ask the simple question:  Which companies do you think are least likely to engage in insider trading?  My initial thoughts are companies like AAPL, GOOG, TSLA, etc. because they‚Äôre so large. If you tried trading off of non-public information on such companies, my guess is it‚Äôd be fairly easy to get caught. Everything about them is closely scrutinized.   On the other hand, I could see the same being true for very small companies or companies with very few employees. Maybe some early biotech companies, or a mining stock?

[$TGT's investor hate-wave is a nothing burger.,;,; **TLDR: TGT is oversold and is due to return to $145 before Earnings and Low/Mid 160's after earnings. I'll probably do a DD on $TGT if/when I get my shit together. Questions/comments are appreciated and possibly used for DD insights.**  From the creator of China-Doomer and shitty $SPY loss porn, I bring to media's currently most hated retailer: Target ($TGT).   We all know how the BS started and the resulting a FB post that "rallied" anti-woke consumers and scared $TGT investors. This bear parade has dropped around 30% from its peak. Multiple downgrades, many institutions hating on them. The recent short is at 11%, a highly bearish mentality over angry boomers.   **So why am I bring them up now?**  Target is oversold on the agenda of "decreasing consumer discretionary spending" and "protests". These are nothing but an over-hyped bear's wet dream. For example, research is pointing towards a significant increase of foot traffic into Target. Consumer Spending is increasing despite the doomer posts.    The downgrades reasoning seemed fishy that pointed at $WMT taking more of the sector. I would argue that $TGT target audiences are different from $WMT. $TGT's audience is Millennials/College Student who want a "luxury" experience that cannot afford it. These two audiences with large student debts may sound scary but will not hurt $TGT's bottom line as long as political garbage drags the issue.     **Conclusion**  $TGT dropping as hard as they did while other discretionary consumer retailer/company is at/near 52w Highs seems contradictory. Either the entire market is ignoring $TGT (Consumer Spending is increasing) or the market is overpricing everyone else (Consumer Spending is decreasing yet they're expecting to buy $AAPL's $3.5k porn gear?).   **Positions**  \- Currently debit spreads: 10x each Sept 145/155C &amp; 155/165C  \- Goal: 50x Sept 145C &amp; 155C and 200x 14DTE w/ +15% movement on earnings.,;,; 2023-06-19 17:52:35]

[Apple's new iPhone 15 sees start of production in India,;,;    Foxconn Technology (OTCPK:FXCOF) is starting production of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) new iPhone 15 at a facility in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, and aims to deliver the phones only weeks after they begin shipping from factories in China, Bloomberg News reported citing people with knowledge of the matter.  The tech giant aims to narrow the gap between its India operations and main production base in China. The companies plan to rapidly increase the volume of new iPhones coming from India.  Apple is on a multiyear project to branch out its production away from China, de-risking the supply chain for its vital products as tensions between the U.S. and China make trade less predictable. Meanwhile, India is seeking to have closer ties with the U.S. and make the country a manufacturing hub.  Before the iPhone 14, India output was behind China by six to nine months. However, this delay was reduced last year, and Apple made 7% of its iPhones in India at the end of March. This year, the company aims to move closer to level on shipment timing from India and China, but suppliers are not certain they will attain it, the report added citing the sources.  The capacity of India manufacturing for the iPhone 15 will depend on the availability of components, which are mostly imported, and the ramp-up of production lines at Foxconn's ‚Äî formally known as Hon Hai Precision (OTCPK:HNHAF) (OTCPK:HNHPF) ‚Äî Sriperumbudur plant, near the city of Chennai.

[Alright dipshits, the fun and games are over.,;,; Well, well, well‚Ä¶you regards just think you‚Äôre a bunch of geniuses. Buying calls on the hottest stocks In the world for the last two weeks has paid you pretty well, eh? Where the fuck were you in October? That‚Äôs right, you were scared of a new bear market and calling for a break below $400. Here we are now at the coveted $500 level. Fuck you Tom Lee, you got one right after 2 years of being wrong.   Well guess what, the fun and games are over. And just for that stunt, you‚Äôre going to get some extra homework. I‚Äôm going to name all the reasons why this party is nearing its finale and we‚Äôll soon see how this next 12-18 months unfolds.   1. The amount of euphoria across all social medias, news outlets, and even word of mouth is insane. I have friends asking if it‚Äôs time to buy $NVDA calls up here. We are so absolutely fucked very soon 2. Majority of bears have capitulated and gone bullish, I don‚Äôt hear any more $SPY $300 by March calls anymore, much less whispers of a recession.  3. The economic stimulus pummeled up our ass for the last 3 years has kept the facade going. Trump pumped 4 trillion during Covid before leaving office which gave us our first bubble. Then Biden gave us an insane ‚Äúinflation reduction act‚Äù which pumped billions into infrastructure which has kept industrials like $CAT $DEERE reaching new 52W highs. All of that HAS to stop soon as we‚Äôve reached $34 TRILLION in debt which far our passes our current GDP estimates. Guess what happens when GDP declines? We‚Äôre Uber fucked. And no I‚Äôm not talking about that fat pig $UBER that‚Äôs also pumped for the sole reason they charge 25% fees on my Wendy‚Äôs delivery orders. Greedy cunts.  4. Following up on the point above, very soon the market will have to price in that the charade is over with the debt ceiling and slowing growth will accelerate this bubble popping faster than you can hit the sell button.  5. Majority of stocks aren‚Äôt really doing shit. Equal $SP500 is flat after 2 years, 39% of stocks are back under their 50 DMA. We are literally being pumped to new highs by a few monopoly stocks that aren‚Äôt even growing that fast. $AAPL is growing at ~3% trading at 35 PE lmao   The list can go on and we all see it but nobody cares because it‚Äôs fun to pump stocks and make shit loads of money off it. Believe me, I have too but it‚Äôs coming to an end very soon. My prediction for the next 6-18 months:   1. We see a correction within the next 2 weeks begin to take us down 10%. By the end of March, we‚Äôll find our footing and small caps will pump hard into a potential rate cut in May. By this point, I think things will be very close to breaking if not breaking already. The fed will cut rates and that will be the trigger for Qs to start dumping. Your mag 7 stocks will decline 30-40% within 3-6 months of the first cut. 2. Fast forward 3 months from the first rate cut and things are getting worse. More layoffs, slowing growth, more missed earnings. The fed will cut again and again and beg for the government to pass more stimulus. It won‚Äôt come. If they do, it will only fuck us more. See China for example  3. Fast forward 9-12months from the rate cut and we may finally see our true bottom with the $NVDA bubble popped, tech back at reasonable levels, and many many people fucked. 4. I predict the next bull market will begin in 2026 and be a very slow recovery. No more v shape bullshit  In the end, I‚Äôm staying patient but preparing for the inevitable. I‚Äôm raising cash, buying far out puts for the first dips coming soon and starting to go heavier into $CHYNA names. I think the money will pump there and India once the U.S finally goes in the shitter. Oh and btw, if you guys liked 0Dte call gamma squeeze on the way up, wait till you see it on the way down! Good luck on your $NVDA $1000 calls dumbasses.

The big brain play is NVDA. During the earnings calls, the big tech companies are gonna repeat these two letters: AI. And who sells the shovels to this gold (and crypto) mine? NVDA.

[Should I sell it all and dip into options?,;,; &amp;#x200B;    In 2017 I won 10k in a settlement with my wife's boyfriends' wife, Wendy. I put most of it in the stock market and decided to mess around. I was a well-regarded man but had studied a few strategies, none of them were useful for the amount of money I had. Instead, I did some "swing" trading, it was an early form of meme trading. Basically, I looked for stocks that had predictable patterns based on news &amp; media coverage and just followed them. For example, at the time Tesla was going up and down based on Elon's tweets. I honestly made a good return on most of my trades, but I was also losing some money on my bad trades. I wasn't losing I was just not winning ;) After realizing there wasn't fast money in the stock market, I decided to put my money into some good fundamental companies. Unfortunatly I did no fundamental research and just picked stocks of companies that were A. OLD B. I knew would probably be around for a while. I put 1k down on GE and ignored my phone. Over the next few weeks GE crashed and I like a well-educated gentlemen followed it down with my money. I chased it down doubling down all the way to the bottom.  I kept trading and got my account balance to breakeven, but I was still defeated.   &amp;#x200B;  With no sign of recovery for GE in sight I decided to pull the rest of my money out and sit on my losses as punishment. I knew that GE would eventually go up again and that time has come. I made some other good trades in the meantime and am now up nearly 100% over the last 5 years. Decent returns but my robinhood account was supposed to be yolo money. I have other accounts for my real money and they make decent returns on their own without my input.   &amp;#x200B;  Should I A: Hold, B: Sell Half now and use the money to yolo some options, C: Sell all of it and yolo it all on some options.

[Dont be a Chad! Sometimes we have to seek Value! Prospect Capital PSEC insiders buying! CEO used own cash in September owns 73 million share,;,; Prospect Capital is a BDC \[Business development company\]. For tax purposes they must pay 90% of income in the form of dividends. Whether the stock goes up or down, they pay monthly dividends of 6 cents. This comes out to 72 cents a year. Based on current stock price that is nearly 13% yield. Before anyone tries to say the dividend will be cut, the company has paid dividends since 2004! It has been steady at 6 cents a month since 2017! Also, the last 2 quarters earnings have been strong enough to support these dividends. Earnings has been good enough to actually increase dividends slightly, but I do not expect it.  PSEC is a financial investment company. They own real estate, do some venture capitalism but mainly they loan companies money at higher rates, many of these loans are secure.

[Apple Headset Bill of Materials Leaked,;,; The bill of materials (basically a list of components needed to manufacture a product) leaked for Apple's new mixed reality headset that they should be announcing during WWDC in 8 days or so (whether it gets announced then is speculation still).  &amp;#x200B;  Twitter link: [  &amp;#x200B;  Most interesting numbers are the cost of production (\~1600 USD), projected cost (other sources are saying \~3000 USD), capacity (\~70k monthly), and quantity (half a mil by second quarter). For reference  i think the oculus is priced from around 400-1000 depending on spec, with similar profit margins.  &amp;#x200B;  Not saying to load up on calls (especially since the announcement is still just rumored), but AAPL has been trading down recently due to declining iPhone sales and a rating downgrade.

[NVDIA, TSLA, TSM, PLTR, SMCI and QQQ,;,;   Hello regards, after the crazy market session with SMCI loosing the $1k level , and with NVDIA ER coming to play next week, I saw lots of posts with probable moves on PLTR, TSM, SMCI and others.  Since IV is quit high for options play in SMCI and NVDIA, if the prices tanked we will not see Put or Call gains. However some regards sugested to go with QQQ, trying to capture the NVDIA movement, I did some charts and from my regardness ( I cant read candles, only YOLO charts), my points are summarized bellow:  1. TSLA:  There is a likelihood that TSLA can be rebound if the market start to sell-of NVDIA after the ER. The chart shows migration from TSLA to NVDIA in January.  2. QQQ : seems does not capture the moves of NVDIA, by the chart presented.  3. PLTR: keep the same NVDIA moviment, if one goes down the other goes too...  4.TSM: looks like after Feb/07 investors also have migrate to NVDIA. But TSM also can follow the NVDIA's patterns post ER.  5. SMCI: this crazy rocket since Jan/17 has it own move ...and the NVDIA results or moves can affect only by fear of wich were happened to SMCI (my gues, I am not an expert).  Any thoughts? Something that I missed or my ape brain could not figure out ?  Disclaymer : I have positions in MSFT and AAPL - calls and both are red :(), Put on COIN and Put on CSCO.  But I am considering buying some Calls on TSLA for DTE 03/15, Put on PLTR and TSM.  TLDR: If NVDIA hit the wall after ER, PLTR seems to follow also SMCI, however TSLA has small chance of rebound, since the migration can be reversed after NVDIA ER.,;,; 2024-02-18 00:21:33]

[APPL DD,;,; Hello fellow Regards, I am about to make all of us rich our the fucking wazoo, listen closely because it‚Äôs not that fucking hard to fat finger the put button.   Ok to begin we can see apple trading between 150-170 these past 3 months right? Right, now if you take a look at the calendar you can see that apple is coming up on its next earnings this Thursday at close which means that Friday will be the market open where we see the actual effect of this earnings call.  Now follow me here on this one because it‚Äôs gonna get very complicated but today we saw Jpow talking about the rate hikes and how we will not be seeing them go away for some time correct? Well immediately after that a whale at JP was seen selling 500,000 shares on the whale watcher app. This whale selling out seems reasonable correct? WRONG, after checking senator listing Nancy pelosi purchased roughly 20 million equivalent in shares instantaneously after the sell off of this whale. Still not seeing the connection? Well if it wasn‚Äôt obvious enough Nancy pelosis husband works at JP Morgan and he most certainly sold off those shares to tax harvest his losses on Rivian, this may seem ok until you remember that tomorrow is thurday and apple earnings effect is on Friday which means that Nancy told Jpow to tank the market or at least make it seem like a whale would want to sell off a large portion to offset suspicion. I wouldn‚Äôt have even bat an eye at this until I saw Jpow use his phone after announcing the rate hike and if you know anything you would know that he most likely texted pelosi or even bought apple for himself.   Furthermore, if you look at cnbc headlines you can see fear mongering, this implies they are bullish and would like to maximize profits being up 121% YTD in all positions, it‚Äôs a ploy to increase credibility of the companies reports correct? Correct! So I took this knowledge along with my degree in mathmatics and saw the chart once more to see slow purchasing of whales while offset by sell offs of average Joe traders like me and you, this is what we call the market being so efficiently priced in because the big boys know what‚Äôs gonna happen already. Now this may seem crazy but that‚Äôs not all, let me ask you when is the day of beast feast? This may seem irrelevant but beast feast is a national holiday celebrated on may 5 also know as Cinco de Mayo. Cinco is 5 in Spanish however in Latin (pre erazoic) it is 2, two days after Friday is Sunday? What is open on Sunday? Not Chic fila a! Therefore this implies every 7th year not considering the leap year we have a reversed beast feast due to the timing of the market. How is this important? Well we know that Tim Cook is a hardcore conservative Christian and he cannot eat Sunday post Cinco de Mayo, so he is gonna be fucking raging mad right? So am I saying puts on apple, fuck no you dumbass clearly you aren‚Äôt following me. He is gonna be so fucking mad that the only way he can offset his mood, based on my chemistry background, he must find an equilibrium with the external environment and therefore to decrease enthally( heat generated by anger) he must increase entropy naturally. Root word tropy (trophy) means that there is a reward waiting for us created by him. Friday is his offset with nature.

I do not know why the market went up (knee-jerk reaction?), but these numbers are massively bearish unless I am missing something obvious.

[Time to Bet it All on Apple Earnings üçé,;,; Gang, earnings saga continues and AAPL is stepping into the earnings today, after-hours. The Wall Street crystal ball is predicting a slight glow-up in earnings to $1.39 a share from last year's $1.29, despite expecting a tiny dip in revenue to $89.28B from $90.15B. That's about a 1% slip.  AAPL shares are showing off an impressive 32.5% gain this year, riding the high on dope tech and that globally-desired fruit logo. But even with those gains, analysts are side-eyeing AAPL's growth and are thirsty for those numbers to start climbing again.  We're all ears on the current quarter ‚Äì it's the jolly season, so you know it's gotta be good, right? Apple hasn't offered official guidance since 2020, but their money man Maestri might drop some breadcrumbs for us. Hopefully.   **What I'll be paying attention to**  By far, the most important part of the Apple story is still the iPhone, their golden geese - bagging nearly half the sales last quarter even with a slight 2.4% drop to $39.67B. Apple launched new iPhones in September with a lighter, redesigned titanium body, a longer telephoto lens, and a USB-C charging port. So we‚Äôll get our first insight into demand for the new 15's. AAPL's been hyping up their iPhone game, promising a sprint from last quarter with around 49 million of those shiny new toys shipped. While they haven't offered official revenue guidance in several quarters, I'll be looking to hear any directional guidance into year-over-year revenue growth in the iPhone, as well as any disclosures regarding sales at the end of September and into October. Per the latest [Canalys report on worldwide smartphone shipments]( Apple‚Äôs market share was 17% in third-quarter 2023, lagging Samsung‚Äôs 20%.  Artificial intelligence remains a priority across technology earnings reports. I believe Apple will be keen to promote its AI advancements within existing products but will likely keep its future AI ambitions close to the vest. We need to further understand Apple‚Äôs AI efforts in more detail, and see how that might be a revenue driver in the future.   Services are the next leg of meaningful growth for Apple. I still view services as a bit of a lagging indicator, as many of these services are coupled with earlier purchases of Apple hardware. This still isn‚Äôt a bad thing, however, as these services create stickiness to the iOS ecosystem, which underpins Apple‚Äôs wide moat. In addition to iPhone revenue, I'll be interested to hear any commentary around services, particularly with some macroeconomic concerns and the financial health of consumers worldwide. Even as the Google trial in Washington DC highlights how much of that is from Google paying Apple to be the default search engine on iPhones, and puts that reportedly $19 billion per year deal at risk over antitrust. Apple is expected to report $21.42 billion in services revenue, offsetting some weak hardware revenue, and which would be an 11% year-over-year increase.  Now, Macs and iPads might not have everyone's attention this quarter, people are expecting to see a bit of a slump from last year's high. Apple's been straight-up about expecting a "double-digit" percent nosedive there, blaming difficult comparisons to a good quarter in 2022 when sales popped after prior supply issues. That's definitely not good. Apple executives could focus on the fact it just released new MacBooks with chips on Oct. 30 with new chips to stoke more interest?  The mood among analysts, especially in regard to expectations for the fourth quarter, is changing. [Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring]( says that there are four forces working against Apple in the December quarter: An unfavorable comparison, a strong dollar, iPhone supply issues, and a cautious consumer.  ‚ÄúSentiment has turned more challenging for shares of Apple in recent days with increasing concerns around the lower demand for the iPhone 15 Series in China, as well as lackluster consumer spending momentum globally,‚Äù wrote [JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee]( earlier this week in a note to investors.  **China**  One data point from a market research firm [tracking smartphone sales]( suggested that iPhone 15 sales started off slow in China this year. Uh oh. I'm worried that renewed competition from Huawei in China could be making the iPhone less competitive in the company‚Äôs third-largest market. It could show up in Apple‚Äôs future guidance.  ‚ÄúApple does have a China problem. I think when it comes to the phone, my sense is it‚Äôs going to be soft in China for the Sept. quarter,‚Äù [Deepwater Asset Management founder Gene Munster said earlier this week.](  There‚Äôs some disagreement among analysts whether the Huawei competition is a temporary or permanent factor for Apple.  ‚ÄúImportantly, we believe the data suggests increased competition from Huawei in China is likely to be a headwind next year,‚Äù Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang wrote in a note last month.  But like, we all kinda know that the new premium Huawei device is pretty much technologically inferior.  ‚ÄúWe expect Huawei-related pressure on iPhone to be temporary and moderate into FY24 due to significantly outdated chipset on the Mate 60 series,‚Äù he continued.  Throughout the quarter, buzz from the financial grapevine, specifically a piece from the Wall Street Journal, spotlighted China's play to ditch foreign tech within government walls. This move turned heads on Wall Street, sparking chatter about Apple's shifting stars in the East and fanning the flames over whether a surge in national pride or looming regulatory storms might have Chinese customers giving Apple the cold shoulder.  ‚ÄúWith Huawei‚Äôs unexpected launch of Mate 60 Pro and Chinese government‚Äôs ban of using foreign phones for government workers, iPhone market share in China has been a big concern for investors,‚Äù wrote [Citi analyst A. Malik].  **Global iPhone Sales**  In other regions, investors want to know if the iPhone 15 is selling like hotcakes, or if it‚Äôs not moving off store shelves as fast as previous years. Analysts call the strength of any given year‚Äôs iPhone sales the ‚Äúcycle.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe are in the camp that [iPhone 15] is not a good cycle on demand weakness and elongation of replacement cycles,‚Äù [Barclays analyst Tim Long]( wrote.  While analysts track ship times on Apple‚Äôs website and third-party estimates for iPhone sales, there‚Äôs no substitute for color from Apple CEO Tim Cook or sales numbers, either from the week or so the iPhone 15 was on sale in September or through its unofficial guidance for the December quarter.  Another factor is that some analysts are pointing to supply constraints on some iPhones, particularly the higher-end and more expensive ‚ÄúPro‚Äù models which could push some sales out of the December quarter and into the January quarter.  ‚ÄúHowever, we are more cautious on the December quarter given iPhone supply shortages and uneven consumer spending, and believe Apple will guide to a revenue range that is both below normal seasonality and consensus expectations,‚Äù wrote Woodring, the Morgan Stanley guy mentioned earlier.  **Price targets?**  There are quite a few analysts who are long term bullish on the stock.   * [Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives]( reiterated an Outperform rating with a price target of $240 on Nov. 1, 2023.   * [Evercore Group analyst Amit Daryanani]( reiterated an Outperform rating with a price target of $210 on Sept. 28, 2023.  * [UBS analyst David Vogt]( reiterated a Neutral rating with a price target of $190 on Sept. 27, 2023.   But others not so much  * [BofA Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan]( reiterated a Neutral rating with a price target of $173 on Oct. 24, 2023. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 77%.  * [Barclays analyst Tim Long]( maintained an Equal-Weight rating and cut the price target from $167 to $166 on Oct. 30, 2023. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 70%.  All of these analysts are reported to have an accuracy of over 70%.   **What to do for Earnings**  I hate to say it, but given what I've read, it seems like Apple won't be doing too hot. That being said, it's tough to predict a direction when all the professional analysts are fairly 50/50 on the matter. I'm pretty sure last time I did an Apple play, I just got a straddle and ended up being 30% in the profit. However, historically, the company doesn't even move that much with earnings. We're looking at an average of 4.9%. I'd be lying if puts didn't look appealing right now. However, just as a lotto, I'm going to grab some AAPL 11/3 170p at about 80 bucks a pop. Keep in mind, like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. Next week we have UBER, DDOG, RIVN, RBLX, AMC, DIS, PLUG and U.,;,; 2023-11-02 16:51:37]

[Why I believe Apple's stock buybacks are misallocation of resources.,;,; Apple has one of the weirdest financial statements in the stock market, with PBR=45 and PER=30. This means the company‚Äôs yearly profit is greater than the equity it holds. In fact, despite being one of the most profitable company in the world, Apple‚Äôs equity has decreased from $140B (Dec. 2017) to $60B. Why? They‚Äôve spent \~$90B on stock buyback and \~$10B on dividend per year (less before 2022). This is good if you are a short-term owner of the stock as the company is basically an ATM that gives back all of its profit to the shareholders. However, is this good in the long-term?   They are buying their stock back at PER of 30, which means 3.3% yield. The treasury yield is &gt;4.5% and they are issuing new bonds at &gt;5% ([ So for their stock buyback to make sense, they need to show very good growth over next few years. However, the company has shown negative growth for nearly a year and I see much more obstacles to their growth such as: deglobalization, EU‚Äôs Digital Market Act, saturation of smartphone industry, not much presence in generative AI market. If they do not show significant growth, their resources should have been spent at 1) not rolling over debts at the high rates, 2) acquisitions, 3) R&amp;D, 4) just dividends.   Because of these reasons, if I have to bet, I would bet their stock buyback will decrease next year. However, Apple has some upsides: low market share in many regions like India, increase in service charges (although this is what DMA seemed to be aimed against), some hidden project like Apple Car. However, I believe Apple‚Äôs main profit-maker (significantly greater margin on Iphone compared to other smartphones) is fully saturated and the company is at a junction where they need to spend their resources at making new revolutionary products and not at stock buybacks.,;,; 2023-10-02 03:03:20]

[APPL DD,;,; Hello fellow Regards, I am about to make all of us rich our the fucking wazoo, listen closely because it‚Äôs not that fucking hard to fat finger the put button.   Ok to begin we can see apple trading between 150-170 these past 3 months right? Right, now if you take a look at the calendar you can see that apple is coming up on its next earnings this Thursday at close which means that Friday will be the market open where we see the actual effect of this earnings call.  Now follow me here on this one because it‚Äôs gonna get very complicated but today we saw Jpow talking about the rate hikes and how we will not be seeing them go away for some time correct? Well immediately after that a whale at JP was seen selling 500,000 shares on the whale watcher app. This whale selling out seems reasonable correct? WRONG, after checking senator listing Nancy pelosi purchased roughly 20 million equivalent in shares instantaneously after the sell off of this whale. Still not seeing the connection? Well if it wasn‚Äôt obvious enough Nancy pelosis husband works at JP Morgan and he most certainly sold off those shares to tax harvest his losses on Rivian, this may seem ok until you remember that tomorrow is thurday and apple earnings effect is on Friday which means that Nancy told Jpow to tank the market or at least make it seem like a whale would want to sell off a large portion to offset suspicion. I wouldn‚Äôt have even bat an eye at this until I saw Jpow use his phone after announcing the rate hike and if you know anything you would know that he most likely texted pelosi or even bought apple for himself.   Furthermore, if you look at cnbc headlines you can see fear mongering, this implies they are bullish and would like to maximize profits being up 121% YTD in all positions, it‚Äôs a ploy to increase credibility of the companies reports correct? Correct! So I took this knowledge along with my degree in mathmatics and saw the chart once more to see slow purchasing of whales while offset by sell offs of average Joe traders like me and you, this is what we call the market being so efficiently priced in because the big boys know what‚Äôs gonna happen already. Now this may seem crazy but that‚Äôs not all, let me ask you when is the day of beast feast? This may seem irrelevant but beast feast is a national holiday celebrated on may 5 also know as Cinco de Mayo. Cinco is 5 in Spanish however in Latin (pre erazoic) it is 2, two days after Friday is Sunday? What is open on Sunday? Not Chic fila a! Therefore this implies every 7th year not considering the leap year we have a reversed beast feast due to the timing of the market. How is this important? Well we know that Tim Cook is a hardcore conservative Christian and he cannot eat Sunday post Cinco de Mayo, so he is gonna be fucking raging mad right? So am I saying puts on apple, fuck no you dumbass clearly you aren‚Äôt following me. He is gonna be so fucking mad that the only way he can offset his mood, based on my chemistry background, he must find an equilibrium with the external environment and therefore to decrease enthally( heat generated by anger) he must increase entropy naturally. Root word tropy (trophy) means that there is a reward waiting for us created by him. Friday is his offset with nature.

[Apple: Why The iPhone 16 Could Be A Breakthrough Platform For AI On The Edge,;,; TL;DR: Apple engineers have recently demonstrated the ability to run large language models (LLMs) on small end devices using flash memory, offering a potential solution to the limitations of DRAM. Apple's next generation of devices, and the iPhone in particular, could be breakthrough platforms for AI on the edge. Apple's lead in chip technology could put it at the forefront of a potential revolution in AI hardware. This would be the foundation for a unique ecosystem of AI apps for Apple devices.  The full text can be found [here](  or [here](      This is the author's opinion only, not financial advice, and is intended for entertainment purposes only. The author holds a beneficial long position in Apple Inc.   "Apple still makes its money by selling end devices. So why should Apple watch its end devices become mere middlemen for its competitors' cloud-based AI solutions? As far as I know, there are no signs that Apple will suddenly enter the cloud AI race with Open AI's ChatGPT or Google Bard. I think Apple is planning something else, and there are the first concrete signs of it: starting with the iPhone, Apple's products could become platforms for running LLMs on the edge. In December 2023, Apple engineers published a [groundbreaking paper]( showing that large LLMs can be run on the flash memory of an end device (such as an iPhone), bypassing the problem of limited DRAM on the edge. Flash memory has about an order of magnitude higher storage capacity than DRAM, making it possible to run even large LLMs on small end devices. Also in December 2023, Apple released its own open source AI framework, [MLX]( which is optimized for Apple's silicon chip architecture. App developers can already use it to write their own machine learning applications on Apple silicon. Earlier, in October 2023, Apple engineers unveiled their own [multimodal LLM Ferret]( which has since been [released as open source]( as well. Every new powerful open source LLM ultimately attacks the market position of commercial LLMs. With the M1-M3 generations, Apple has developed cutting-edge processor technology and has been a leading chip developer for years. For now, AI appears to be primarily a software revolution. Given the similar performance of OpenAI's GPT-3.5, xAI's Grok, the open source model Mixtral, and Google's Gemini Pro, as well as the reported similar performance of OpenAI's GPT 4.0 and Google's Gemini Ultra, there is already a suspicion that we are not so far away from the maximum possible performance of the new LLMs - some call it [Peak AI]( Perhaps the next quantum leap in AI will be preceded by a revolution in computer chips - in which case Apple, as a leading chip designer, would suddenly be at the forefront. And when it comes to implementing and applying such AI models, let's not forget that Apple's devices are already packed with all kinds of sensors that generate a constant stream of data for locally executed AI.  So do we really want to believe that the world's most highly capitalized company is sleeping through the AI revolution and thinks it can continue to satisfy its customers with annual "lackluster" updates to high-priced devices? I doubt that Apple is simply relying on its product ecosystem to keep its customers. A new generation of iPhones and other devices capable of efficiently running AI on the edge would be the foundation for an ecosystem of new Apple and third-party apps that only Apple device owners would have access to - a Buffetian economic moat par excellence.

[Apple, Amazon and Coinbase Earnings Today,;,; Today we have a pretty massive line up with earnings, and I wanted to offer my 2 cents for those looking to play either Apple or Amazon  **Apple**  Let's start with AAPL. Apple‚Äôs stock is up over 51% so far in 2023, hitting all-time highs. I honestly see it as a safe haven with strong cash flow, even tho investors have been worrying about slowing demand for consumer goods, including PCs and smartphones. During the call, I'll want to hear about how the current quarter, which ends in September, is shaking out. Apple hasn‚Äôt given guidance since 2020, citing uncertainty, but they will provide us with some data points that they can use to determine whether Apple sees overall sales growing or shrinking. Wall street is expecting   * Revenue: $81.7 billion  &gt; iPhone revenue: $40.2 billion  &gt; iPad revenue: $6.4 billion  &gt; Mac revenue: $6.3 billion  &gt; Other products: $8.3 billion  &gt; Services: $20.7 billion  * EPS: $1.19 per share  The company‚Äôs forecast will be more important. It may give clues as to whether global economies are set up for a ‚Äú[soft landing]( after two years of interest rate hikes. The June period is typically Apple‚Äôs slowest quarter of the year, while its fourth fiscal quarter often captures back-to-school laptop spending, a few days of new iPhone model sales ‚Äî which usually come out in September ‚Äî and shows Apple‚Äôs momentum heading into the holiday season.  ‚ÄúWhat will matter most will be management‚Äôs September quarter,‚Äù wrote Morgan Stanley analyst [Erik Woodring]( in July, adding that he expects Apple to guide to year-over-year revenue growth again.   I'm eager to see Apple give data points on India sales. Apple CEO Tim Cook traveled to the country in April and spoke about hopes for significant growth in the region. India became one of Apple‚Äôs top five iPhone markets during the quarter.  I don't know if people follow professional analyst notes, but [D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte wrote this week,]( ‚ÄúOn the call, we look for additional details on its expansion in India, including its retail and manufacturing presence.‚Äù   But Apple‚Äôs older growth driver, China, is likely to be closely watched as well. Greater China ‚Äî including Hong Kong and Taiwan ‚Äî is Apple‚Äôs third-largest sales region, and it has reported two straight quarters of revenue decline, even as the region reopened after years of strict Covid lockdowns.  ‚ÄúIn our conversations, most investors feel that a soft China could pose a risk to the numbers and further commentary, but we feel that Apple‚Äôs position in China is on a solid footing and that the company is likely to see only a small if any decline in its iPhone sales,‚Äù wrote [Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar]( Kumar said if China ends up being weak, it could be offset by strong sales momentum in India.  Apple mainly manufactures in China and investors will want to hear that the company has overcome many of the supply chain snags that have hampered sales over the past two years. If Apple stockpiled parts and has enough to make what it needs to produce, it could help margins.  Maybe people are tired of me tossing random names in the air, but a lot of these analysts are paid to do the heavy-hitting research, so it's only beneficial to read up on what they say. J.P. Morgan analyst [Samik Chatterjee]( thinks it is time to start viewing Apple in a new light, and I agree with this sentiment. Rather than seeing the tech giant as a product cycle company, it should be seen as a ‚Äòresilient earnings compounder.‚Äô  ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs diversified revenue drivers within Hardware, as well as the natural diversification of the replacement cycle for hardware product on account of a ~2 bn installed base of devices has moved the company incrementally away from being dependent on a product cycle relative to iPhones or any other hardware,‚Äù the analyst opined.  Moreover, the Services segment has grown significantly over time and is now well diversified in terms of its drivers, allowing it to achieve double-digit growth (excluding currency impact) even during challenging economic times. This ‚Äúinherent diversification‚Äù positions the company next to other ‚Äú‚Äôearnings compounders‚Äô with resilient drivers.‚Äù  It also makes it easier to justify the premium multiple the stock has been trading at for the last six months, one which it is likely now to hold on to. Apple‚Äôs profitable services division includes monthly subscriptions such as Apple Music, warranties under AppleCare, fees from the App Store, advertising revenue from search licensing agreements with Google, payments from Apple Pay and other products. I'd like to see Apple‚Äôs services business grow regularly and smoothly, because the margins on services are so much higher than when Apple sells hardware. In particular, many analysts want to see services re-accelerate after a few quarters of weak growth because of lagging App Store software sales.  Apple suggested a 5.5% year-over-year increase in services]( and [FactSet‚Äôs]( estimates more than $20.7 billion in revenue. In fact, given the fact Apple is ‚Äúwell positioned to drive higher confidence from the upcoming earnings print as an ‚Äòearnings compounder‚Äô that continues to drive resilient performance,‚Äù Chatterjee thinks a new price target is due.  As for what to look out for in the report, Chatterjee expects the major highlight will be the pivot back to revenue growth on a year-over-year basis in F4Q23 (September quarter), boosted by ‚Äútypical seasonality‚Äù in the majority of the business‚Äô segments but with an additional kick from ‚Äúmoderating currency and improving Services growth rates as advertising rebounds.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe return to growth will mark Apple cycling past the most uncertain macro backdrop with resilient revenue and earnings, and well positioned to drive robust growth in a normal macro,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúFor the Services business, we expect year-over-year revenue growth to accelerate from the +5% level expected in [fiscal third quarter,] with our checks suggesting online advertising has improved,‚Äù [Deutsche Bank analyst Sidney Ho]( wrote. But analysts will want to see Apple signal more growth than that.   We also need to keep in mind, Apple's AI acceleration. These analysts will also likely ask about artificial intelligence, given the industry wide obsession with the technology. There's also been a recent [Bloomberg report]( that Apple is developing a ChatGPT-like AI model internally. Don‚Äôt expect Apple to gush about what it‚Äôs working on internally, though. ‚ÄúWith the official intro of Vision Pro, we expect Apple‚Äôs updated comments on its AI aspirations to be a focus (albeit likely very high-level),‚Äù wrote [Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers.](  Apple reports its results by product line, which can give us a look into which businesses are thriving and which ones are in a down cycle. IPhone, iPad and Mac sales are all expected to be down on an annual basis, with iPad sales projected to drop nearly 11%. Wearables, the product category with headphones and Apple Watch ‚Äî and what will likely be the reporting category for Vision Pro when it goes on sale ‚Äî is projected to decline less than 1%. However, the experts expect Apple‚Äôs services business to grow 5.2% on an annual basis, which would be a bright spot for the report.  Given these details, I'm fairly sure AAPL calls will be the play today, but with high IV, I'm gonna grab a spread. I can buy the 8/4 192.5c for $300 and sell the 195c for $196. This means I can grab the spread for $104 each. Ideally, if AAPL were to go up just 1.8%, this means the spread can be sold at 140% profit.    **Amazon**  Okay, next is AMZN where analysts are predicting an earnings of $0.35 per share, significantly better than the loss of $0.200 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. In terms of sales, they anticipate an increase of 8.46% over the prior year quarter. For revenue, we expect them to report $131.49 billion. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts forecast a profit per share of $1.61. Data from [refinitiv](  While revenue growth remains steady at Amazon, [it‚Äôs been stuck in the single digits]( for five out of the past six quarters. That trend is expected to continue, as analysts are looking for 8.5% growth in the second quarter and a number just slightly higher in the third period.  I believe Amazon‚Äôs expanding Amazon Web Services (AWS) will have a large impact on its second-quarter performance. Amazon Web Services has been a growth driver for years, but the pace of expansion is slowing as customers clamp down on spending due to an uncertain economic outlook. In the first quarter, AWS sales increased roughly 16%, the slowest growth since 2015, when Amazon began breaking out cloud revenue.   In the second quarter, AWS made its purpose-built security data lake, called Amazon Security Lake, generally available. The service aids in the simplification of compliance monitoring and security data management across hybrid and multi-cloud environments by centralizing an organization‚Äôs security data across AWS environments. It introduced a new configuration for Amazon Aurora, namely Amazon Aurora I/O-Optimized, which provides improved price performance and predictable pricing for I/O-intensive applications. It unveiled three new capabilities for its threat detection service called Amazon GuardDuty - GuardDuty EKS Runtime Monitoring, GuardDuty RDS Protection and GuardDuty Lambda Protection. AWS also announced the general availability of its no-code service, called AppFabric. I expect all these initiatives to have helped Amazon win customers. This, in turn, is expected to have boosted AWS‚Äôs second-quarter revenues, whose consensus mark stands at $21.49 billion, up 8.9% from the year-ago reported figure.  However, Brian Olsavsky (Amazon‚Äôs finance chief) warned in April that the company expects to see more of the same in the second quarter in cloud. In addition to cloud, profit margins will be an area of emphasis for investors, as well as artificial intelligence, a focus for companies across the sector.  ‚ÄúThe key question will be whether management suggests that with the timing of the optimization cycle, AI workloads, and easing comps that AWS is likely to start showing revenue growth acceleration beginning in Q3,‚Äù analysts at [Evercore]( who have the equivalent of a buy rating on Amazon, wrote in a note this week. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know.‚Äù  AWS rivals Microsoft and Alphabet last week reported solid results in their cloud businesses, beating analysts‚Äô revenue expectations. But both companies said they continue to see organizations moderating their cloud spend.   Last week, Amazon hosted an AWS Summit, where the company announced updates related to generative AI, including a service that uses the technology to transcribe and summarize doctors‚Äô patient visits. Amazon‚Äôs results will give investors a sense of whether the company‚Äôs ongoing cost-cutting efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Evercore analysts said they expect to see improving margins in Amazon‚Äôs retail business in the second quarter, as ‚Äúcomps against ‚Äô22‚Ä≤s massive cost spikes, capacity utilization recovers, and newfound efficiencies from the regionalization of Amazon‚Äôs retail operations kick in.‚Äù  Recent data released by the company showed improving delivery speeds and efficiencies in Amazon‚Äôs fulfillment network. The company said it‚Äôs made significant headway on its efforts to establish one- and same-day delivery as the standard for Prime members, while also bringing costs down. Also during the quarter, Amazon hosted its annual Prime Day discount bonanza, which they claim as its ‚Äúbiggest ever.‚Äù Amazon‚Äôs guidance for the third quarter could give a glimpse into how much Prime Day lifted sales.  Amazon‚Äôs advertising business is becoming increasingly important to the company‚Äôs financials. Several industry surveys have indicated a slow rebound in the digital ad market may be underway. Meta showed better-than-expected results last week, but rival Snap fell short of sales expectations and gave a weak forecast for the current quarter.  With Amazon's earnings, it's certainly a toss up. But I'm learning bullish. I'm gonna go ahead and do another call spread, getting AMZN 130c at $380 a pop, and selling the 135c at $195 each. This means I can grab the spread for $185 each. If AMZN were to go up with earnings, just 4.8%, this play will profit 170%.   **Coinbase**  Last and certainly least, there's Coinbase. I don't know if anyone rememebers but the SEC [sued the crypto exchange]( not too long ago. The lawsuit is in regards to them allegedly operating as an unregistered exchange.   At today's earnings, investors are gonna be listening to hear about trading volumes and adjusted EBITDA. Coinbase improved its net loss from $557 million during the fourth quarter of last year to $79 million in the first three months of 2023. The exchange generated $284 million in adjusted EBITDA ‚Äî earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ‚Äî last quarter compared to a $124 million loss in the prior quarter.   ‚ÄúUnlike last quarter [when] we saw potential upside going into the print, this quarter is the opposite,‚Äù said [Owen Lau]( an executive director at Oppenheimer and Co. Lau mentioned that he estimates Coinbase‚Äôs trading volume will have fallen 34% quarter over quarter ‚Äî from $145 billion to $91 billion. The exchange‚Äôs adjusted EBITDA could fall about 90% to $29 million, he added.  [Mark Palmer]( an analyst for Berenberg Capital Markets, said the [Ripple ruling]( and the prospects of a spot [bitcoin ETF]( approval have given some investors ‚Äúa false sense of confidence‚Äù about Coinbase‚Äôs prospects.  In addition to weak transaction volumes, Coinbase‚Äôs results are likely to reflect lower interest income from USD Coin (the digital stablecoin). The exchange, which [introduced the stablecoin]( with payments company Circle in 2018, offers users rewards by holding USD Coin on Coinbase.  Interest income rose to about $240 million during the first quarter, up from $182 million during the prior quarter. Of that $240 million, $199 million was USD Coin, Coinbase said in its Q1 shareholder letter. But USD Coin‚Äôs market capitalization has fallen by more than 50% over the past year.  ‚ÄúWe see no reason why Coinbase‚Äôs guidance for the balance of the year should be particularly encouraging,‚Äù Palmer said. ‚ÄúWhile interest income on USD Coin has been a tailwind for Coinbase since interest rates started to rise, the continued decline in the stablecoin‚Äôs market cap raises real questions about the extent to which that income will support its operating performance going forward.‚Äù  Morningstar Analyst [Michael Miller]( said he will be paying particular attention to Coinbase‚Äôs expenses and non-trading revenue sources. So will I. The exchange‚Äôs operating expenses fell to $896 million in the first three months of 2023, a 24% drop from the previous quarter. The figure represented its lowest level of expenses since the first quarter of 2021.   ‚ÄúCoinbase has signaled that it‚Äôs pulling back on its investment spending during weak cryptocurrency markets and what it chooses to continue to invest in will indicate what it sees as priorities,‚Äù Miller mentioned.   Still, Coinbase said in its May shareholder letter that it expected second quarter expenses to increase due in part to higher legal expenses. Miller said he is also keeping an eye on any momentum Coinbase reports related to reducing its reliance on transaction fees.   Coinbase‚Äôs so-called subscription and services revenue, the bulk of which was interest income last quarter, also includes blockchain rewards from staking and custodial fee revenue. Combined, the category brought in about $362 million last quarter, compared to $375 million of transaction revenue.     ‚ÄúCoinbase being selected to provide custodial and surveillance services for a potential Blackrock ETF is a win on this front,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut it remains to be seen how much subscription and service growth Coinbase can create outside of interest income, which is now facing major headwinds.‚Äù   Guidance around the road forward as Coinbase deals with the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit could be helpful as well. The SEC has said it would oppose any motion brought by Coinbase seeking to dismiss the commission‚Äôs lawsuit. Honestly, any update related to Coinbase‚Äôs regulatory issues would very interesting but I‚Äôm not really expecting anything material to come out with earnings.  As a result of my research, I'm just gonna go ahead and get puts. COIN 8/4 90p is $420, and the 85p is trading at $242. Which means I can get a put spread for $178. Like the previous plays, I'm buying the more expensive contract, and selling the cheaper one as a hedge. If the stock were to drop 7.1%, this spread will profit 181%.,;,; 2023-08-03 19:33:44]

[Apple's new iPhone 15 sees start of production in India,;,;    Foxconn Technology (OTCPK:FXCOF) is starting production of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) new iPhone 15 at a facility in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, and aims to deliver the phones only weeks after they begin shipping from factories in China, Bloomberg News reported citing people with knowledge of the matter.  The tech giant aims to narrow the gap between its India operations and main production base in China. The companies plan to rapidly increase the volume of new iPhones coming from India.  Apple is on a multiyear project to branch out its production away from China, de-risking the supply chain for its vital products as tensions between the U.S. and China make trade less predictable. Meanwhile, India is seeking to have closer ties with the U.S. and make the country a manufacturing hub.  Before the iPhone 14, India output was behind China by six to nine months. However, this delay was reduced last year, and Apple made 7% of its iPhones in India at the end of March. This year, the company aims to move closer to level on shipment timing from India and China, but suppliers are not certain they will attain it, the report added citing the sources.  The capacity of India manufacturing for the iPhone 15 will depend on the availability of components, which are mostly imported, and the ramp-up of production lines at Foxconn's ‚Äî formally known as Hon Hai Precision (OTCPK:HNHAF) (OTCPK:HNHPF) ‚Äî Sriperumbudur plant, near the city of Chennai.

[Apple Inc. Faces Steep Decline in Stock Price as Q4 Sales Projections Wane,;,; In a surprising turn of events for tech giant Apple Inc., the company's stock price is poised for a significant downturn in the final quarter of 2023.  The just broke it‚Äôs 4 days winning streak and the volume is much lower than normal. Numerous indicators, including a decline in projected sales and worrisome economic factors, suggest a challenging period ahead for one of the world's most valuable companies.  The Google search engine lawsuit also weighs heavily on the company and it can cause a significant earnings drop if the arrangement was to be cancelled. Apple has not yet launched any major AI enabled capability and the sales volume for the newly launched IPhone 15 look dismal. Chinese customers are cautious and the recent ban on government officials carrying iPhone is also causing a dip in the demand.  Apple's Q4 2023 sales projections have fallen short of expectations, sending ripples throughout the financial markets. Analysts, who previously anticipated a robust quarter, have revised their forecasts downward, citing multiple factors contributing to the decline.  The latest sales figures show a dip in iPhone sales, a critical source of revenue for the company, primarily due to market saturation and consumers holding onto their devices for longer periods. Moreover, supply chain issues have constrained product availability, resulting in delayed launches and unfulfilled demand.  Several economic factors are also contributing to Apple's woes. A recent hike in interest rates by the Federal Reserve has tightened consumer spending, impacting the purchasing power of prospective Apple customers. Rising inflation has made Apple's premium products less affordable for consumers, creating a headwind for sales.  Furthermore, global economic uncertainty and ongoing trade disputes have disrupted the company's international market operations. Supply chain disruptions caused by geopolitical tensions have driven up production costs, further pressuring Apple's margins.  As of October 11, 2023, Apple's stock (AAPL) is trading at $178.39 per share, a significant drop from its 52-week high of $198.23. The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio has contracted to 29.98, indicating that investors are becoming increasingly cautious about the company's future growth prospects. The company's market capitalization now stands at $2.79 trillion.  Looking at technical indicators, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has crossed below the signal line, traditionally considered a bearish sign, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is nearing oversold territory, suggesting that the stock may be undervalued or experiencing strong selling pressure.  Investor sentiment is undoubtedly shifting. While Apple has long been considered a safe haven for investors, a growing number of shareholders are expressing concerns about the company's ability to sustain its historic growth rate. The sentiment is reflected in the significant increase in short interest over the past month, as more investors bet on the stock's decline.  Apple Inc. finds itself at a critical juncture, facing a multitude of challenges that are impacting its sales and stock price. With declining sales projections, economic headwinds, and a changing investor sentiment, the company's stock price is likely to experience a sharp decline in the coming quarters. Apple's ability to adapt and navigate these challenges will be closely watched by investors and market analysts worldwide.,;,; 2023-10-11 05:20:06]

After watching the Blackberry movie it was painfully obvious that if you don't innovate and change you will wither a violent death on the vine; speaking of berry's.   But Apple, if it plays its cards correctly it has the best situation today to take full advantage of AI. Before I explain how, there is a stark warning here. If Apple chooses to ignore the reality and not innovate because it wants to hold on dearly to it's legacy platform it will suffer the consequences.   In short, I would think they have about 2 quarters to show the goods/something before other players begin to take an unprecedented hold. In the very least, mindshare.     So how can AI drastically change the upward trajectory of Apple for the next 20 years?   Edge AI/Endpoint AI.   As of now, your AI is strictly coming from an API that is utilized by a user experience that is brought to you by an APP or a browser.   This has no real effect for buying a new Iphone or even wanting to. This problem is looming large for phone and pc manufactures alike. So how does Edge AI change this?   Incomes AI agents. However, the architecture here is a bit more complex that is currently experiences by API AI. Currently, the way AI works is by tokens.   You can think of tokens under 2 premises.   1. They are a currency exchange of data going into the API and data/response being received from the question or query you give the API. Literally, currency because they cost money in exactly that exchange. As an example if I ask GPT to write a book the incoming tokens are small but the output would be very large.  2. A form of short term memory or if you're an engineer "cache". This allows the conversation to be remembered for a short (token limit) amount of time. The AI api does this trick by adding back in your previous responses and answers for each one of your queries. Even when you don't realize it. This also is hell on your browser memory and caching system. In short, it's completely inefficient and overly large token limits aren't helpful but that is another topic.   So how can AI agents help this? Localized memory. Think of it like this. A gaming console PS5 or Xbox Series X is still better for gaming than pure online gaming? Why. Because having local memory and compute is still better than trying to pipe network calls of cloud compute. The end user hardware is still a viable solution and persits to this day. Don't believe me, ask Google Stadia. That closed down faster than Google Glass.   AI agents can be this and even for more reasons than the previous cloud gaming example.   AI agents, in a certain form, can be localized agents that manage memory, history and potentially AI models themselves.   That last part requires chips that are GPU like chips that will be great with inference which is the AI term of hitting an AI model for the models reponse. Meaning, a local model that has been trained with YOUR data can be trained and then inferenced (called) all within your device.    Before you think I'm talking nonsense. Take a look at Rabbit.     Now this may not be something you're interested in but it is the shot across the proverbial bow. It's a device that connects to ChatGPT by internet.   Another device which is similar is The Pin. It even has a cute little projector so that you can look at things on your "hand".     Again, the Pin connects to ChatGPT through the internet.   And yet while these devices are cute they're, in my opinion, useless really. They don't do what your Apple watch, Iphone or Ipad can already do through a browser and or an app.   My point here isn't to DD or dogshit on these devices but to explain a point of not being very viable. They require the internet for any use.   While the internet is fine for the current API version of AI it is not very useful for true long term memory Agent AI.  **The Rise of NPU's**  Running an advanced form of an AI agent with localized models requires GPU type compute and that exists in chips today. It's called an NPU. An NPU is an ARM semiconductor term for a Neural Processing Unit. There are all types of mobile/Edge AI semiconductor names that you may of heard of. TPU's, NPU's, GPU's, etcetera.   The point is, they are a type of silicon chip that can be run on a power efficient mobile system such as those through ARM.   So how might this all help out Apple? Well, for the first time in a decade there could be a real reason to actually upgrade your phone. Hell, throw in the projector if you want but the capability of keeping an updated AI agent locally will need to have more compute power, memory and capabilities then what is currently available from an Iphone. Throw in some practical features such as data aggregation and inference management and you have a bonafide but localized AI agent from from the Edge.   **True Agency through an entire new App store**  Next, because your phone can be a real artificial intelligent agent you could power other such devices from your phone. Again, more compute, memory and capabilities.   Imagine an entirely new framework of "apps".   Imagine saying hey Siri "Can you reprogram my security system to not go off when my mother comes to the house, in fact can you let her in when she arrives."  Or "Hey Siri, can you start the oven at 3pm today at 350 for an hour."   Or "Hey Sir, can you create a practice math test for Jason and send it to his Ipad. Send me the results when he's finished and let's setup a call when he's done so we can go over it."   Or "Hey Siri, remind me when this stock reaches this price so I can buy more and can you execute the trade for me."  The possibility of connected AI capabilities through Apps that already exist but are in their own silos is endless.   AI would effectively move those apps outside of their silos and connect in ways we've never imagined.   But this can't be done properly without AI agents and a certain level of agency.   The future is bright and Apple could lead this new technology into the future. If not, somebody is going to do it.   I would usually get paid for such consultancy but consider it a gift.   If Apple spoke to this I would buy more than 1 share. ,;,; 2024-01-31 03:40:16]
[Apple launches new mental, eye health features,;,; At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference Apple introduced its much awaited mixed-reality headset Apple Vision Pro, but quietly also provided new health features in iOS 17, iPad OS 17, and watch OS 10, expanding in two impactful areas.  The company said the new mental health features allow users to log their momentary emotions and daily moods, see valuable insights, and access evaluations and resources.  The iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch offer new vision health features which encourage healthy behaviors to reduce the risk of myopia (nearsightedness), and the Health app has come to iPad, according to the company.  Apple noted that new features and existing health features are based in science and built with privacy at the core.  **Mental Health:**  In the Health app people can scroll through engaging, multidimensional shapes and choose how they are feeling in a range from Very Pleasant to Very Unpleasant. Then, they can select associations which are having the biggest impact on their feelings, such as Travel or Family, and describe their feelings, like Grateful or Worried, the company added.  Users can see insights to identify what may be contributing to their state of mind ‚Äî if it's associations or lifestyle factors, such as sleep or exercise ‚Äî and can use this to better manage their health, Apple noted.  **Vision Health:**  Apple said that with watch OS 10, Apple Watch launched the ability to measure time spent in daylight using the ambient light sensor.  Users can view the amount of time spent in daylight detected by their Apple Watch in the Health app in iOS 17 and iPad OS 17.  Apple said the new Screen Distance feature uses the same TrueDepth camera which powers Face ID on iPhone and iPad to encourage users to move their device farther away after holding it closer than 12 inches for a longer time.  Children who do not have their own phone, can use Family Setup to pair the Apple Watch to their parent's iPhone, which will give the guardians visibility into the amount of time the kids are spending in daylight with Health Sharing  Additional Updates: With iOS 17, iPad OS 17, and watch OS 10, the Medications feature provides users the option to receive follow-up reminders if they have not logged taking a scheduled medicine.  The new Journal app on iOS 17 allows users to writing about and remembering life's moments. The app uses new Journaling Suggestions API to offer a personalized set of moments to write about, using on-device machine learning.  Apple Fitness+ introduced Custom Plans, via which users receive a custom workout or meditation schedule based on day, duration and workout type, among other things.,;,; 2023-06-06 10:24:53]

[Time to sell: Apple's Wonderlust Event: Tim Cook's 180-Degree Jump On Hold,;,; Apple's Wonderlust Event: Tim Cook's 180-Degree Jump On Hold  Inside sources at Apple have revealed that Tim Cook, Apple's revered CEO, had a jaw-dropping 180-degree jump planned for the upcoming Wonderlust event. This was where the iPhone 15 was poised for its grand unveiling. The idea was for Cook to leap into the air, execute a twist, and land facing the opposite direction. This ambitious sequence was to be captured by a camera which would transition seamlessly, ensuring the audience would never see Cook's back.  However, these plans might have to be shelved as Cook is currently grappling with ankle issues. With the event fast approaching, insiders hope for his timely recovery, as this jump has been something he's been planning for the better part of a year.  Those familiar with Apple's history know that Steve Jobs, Apple's late co-founder, had an undeniable charisma on stage. Cook, having always held deep admiration for Jobs' theatrical prowess, saw this jump as an opportunity to take a leap forward in his stage presence. This theatrical flourish wasn't just for the spectacle, but to symbolize Apple's radical shift in direction, especially with the introduction of the UCB-C port.  But for Cook, and indeed for Apple, the larger picture always takes precedence. Health is paramount, and taking risks, especially physical ones, might not be worth the price, no matter how impactful the intended message.  There's still some hope that Cook might compromise with a 90-degree turn instead, which, while less dramatic, still conveys the message of a change in direction. Fans and analysts are watching closely, with many sending well wishes for Cook's speedy recovery.  As the Wonderlust event approaches, the tech world is abuzz not just about the new iPhone 15 and its features, but also about Cook's potential stage antics. Whether he jumps or not, it's clear that Apple's CEO knows how to keep the world on its toes. Whatever happens, Apple's upcoming event promises to be memorable in more ways than one.,;,; 2023-09-11 19:18:36]

[Supreme Court rules in Apple's favor in Epic Games appeal,;,;  In the ongoing legal battle between Epic Games and Apple, the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of Apple, allowing the tech giant to maintain its App Store payment rules for now. This decision is a temporary win for Apple, as the lawsuit continues to unfold.  Currently, companies selling apps on the App Store are charged a percentage of the sale price (15% to 30%) for using the platform. Epic, along with others like Spotify, claimed this practice was unfair.  While Apple largely won the suit and wasn't found guilty of anticompetitive behavior, the judge did mandate that Apple's anti-steering rules be lifted. **This meant that companies should be allowed to guide users to their own sites for purchases or subscriptions, potentially offering lower prices than on the App Store.** The Ninth Circuit upheld this ruling but paused its implementation, allowing Apple to appeal to the Supreme Court.  The recent win for Apple results from the Supreme Court's decision not to expedite the implementation of the anti-steering rules. Justice Kagan rejected Epic's plea to have the rules enforced immediately, granting Apple more time. This victory isn't definitive, though, as the legal battle is far from over.  **The implications of this case are significant. Beyond the US, the EU is also pressuring Apple to revise its App Store rules to allow third-party developers to offer alternative payment methods. The outcome could impact not only Apple's App Store revenue but also set a precedent for other video game companies to offer alternate purchasing options, potentially affecting Apple's bottom line.**  In conclusion, while Apple has scored a small victory in the ongoing legal saga with Epic Games, the larger implications and potential changes to App Store rules are still to be determined. The battle is far from its final stages, and its outcome could have far-reaching consequences for the app and gaming industry.  **Summarized by CHATGPT, Siri's 100000x better version.**   Source: [  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-08-10 02:18:03]

[Psyops and Apples Earnings‚Ä¶. 5-4-23 SPY/ ES Futures and VIX Daily Market Analysis,;,; Well unless you live under a rock you saw the media having a full tizzy today about WAL. Now lets paint the picture here‚Ä¶   You have PACW last night publicly declaring literally hours after JPOW said the banks were strong and sound that it was infact not strong and sound. And that they were weighing their options‚Ä¶ The market absolutely did not handle that news well.   Amazingly the market continued to still buy the dip throughout the night. Then what happens? The Financial Times puts out a piece that it has hired advisors to explore its options‚Ä¶ now the true question is how does something like this get made up? Or is it?   &amp;#x200B;    Lets think about this logistically‚Ä¶ is a major media source like the financial times who is the worlds largest circulation fund group out there really going to put out a fake article? Would a company like them REALLY risk their status and credibility doing that?   No I don‚Äôt think they would‚Ä¶ so this is my thoughts‚Ä¶ PACW is going to go under next as we saw last night after hours with the hit piece‚Ä¶ now WAL is probably the next one to go down‚Ä¶ perhaps it was meant to be released after hours today and the article got pushed too quickly‚Ä¶ or perhaps the source leaked the info quicker than they were supposed to‚Ä¶ we will never know the truth‚Ä¶  There are two ways to look at this‚Ä¶ WAL is truly on the brink of collapse and are clinging to life with saying it was false or two that was a VERY purposefully released statement to cause panic and then they retracted it to save the market‚Ä¶ Whether its right or not think about how much more easily that news will be digested when it actually comes true‚Ä¶ Buy the rumor and sell the news‚Ä¶   I truly don‚Äôt think we have seen the last of these banks collapsing.  **APPLE EARNINGS**  &amp;#x200B;    Im actually a little surprised as of writing this and the conference call starting at 5pm that Apple is only up 1%... that‚Äôs pretty underwhelming move for Apple as I believe about a 3.5% move was expected‚Ä¶   **SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**   &amp;#x200B;    Now we did not make any changes to supply/ demand today but we did come down and bounce pretty nicely off that 404.3 demand area and closed over it. There is a very real scenario here where we actually could find ourselves bouncing green tomorrow back to that 410 area which would likely established this 405.13 area as a new demand (support). If that happens then I would actually look for a rally into CPI next week back to that 415-417 area.   However, if with the lackluster Apple move after hours and most importantly Unemployment rate in the morning‚Ä¶ takes us down then we could look for a closure under 404.3 tomorrow which then once again opens up a move to 399.07.   **SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**   &amp;#x200B;    On SPY daily here we DID finally close back under 405.2 support and more importantly we did break that rising wedge on the daily timeframe once again‚Ä¶ Now this has happened once before last week and that led to an immediate bounce back to 415-417 area.   I actually tend to favor a bullish move from here‚Ä¶ We didn‚Äôt close out In my opinion a very bearish continuation candle. This is more of a dragonfly doji/ hanging man candle close which would more likely than not result in a push back up tomorrow not down.   Bear case- we closed a full candle below the daily 8/20ema and actually closed below the daily 50ema for the first time since March 28th. We closed under 405.2 which is a major pivot point. We broke through a major support of the daily rising wedge. Daily IV and price action represent a bearish movement not bullish.   Bull case- we did close that hanging man bullish reversal pattern today. With 404.3 demand being a nice support bounce here and seemingly the banking issues being over for now‚Ä¶ without further fuel for the sell off realistically this could see a reversal back to the upside.   &amp;#x200B;    From a weekly stand point here‚Ä¶ bears NEED a closure under 407.3 minimally but ideally under 402.5 EOD tomorrow‚Ä¶ Bulls NEED a closure minimally back over 407.3 but realistically back over 411.6.   SPY Daily Levels    Supply- 399.1 -&gt; 415.6    Demand- 404.3     Support- 404.3 -&gt; 401.4 -&gt; 399.9    Resistance- 407 -&gt; 407.92 -&gt; 411.5  **FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**  &amp;#x200B;    A slightly different story on Futures here‚Ä¶ so what im seeing is that we did end up losing 4085 demand (support) and actually are turning it into resistance now‚Ä¶ We can within 7 points of that 4055 supply target I have been so longly waiting for‚Ä¶   Now a few major differences here on Futures is that we have no put in 5 out of the last 6 days as ‚Äúhigh volatility‚Äù candles‚Ä¶ this in simple terms means that there is MAJOR fights in price action going on‚Ä¶ in very simple terms‚Ä¶ low volatility means that one side is sitting out (as in buyers easily are winning) and high volatility means that there is a high level of movement on buyers and sellers to get whatever direction we have‚Ä¶ Why does this matter? Well it matters because the last time we had this many high volatility candles in this short period of time was the March bottom‚Ä¶ now keep in mind high volatility usually signifies and end of a trend‚Ä¶ what would you say the longer term trend has been? That would be bullish‚Ä¶ so if that is changing well‚Ä¶ we may be seeing the top then‚Ä¶. Now mind you this will never predict the timing of it and a daily timeframe can take a while to pray out‚Ä¶   **FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**  &amp;#x200B;    Now on futures as I had mentioned yesterday we had lost the daily rising wedge support which signified that we should have seen the red day like we did get today. However, the daily candle structure remains notably different and is very important in its difference‚Ä¶  The daily futures candles is actually a gravestone doji‚Ä¶ now this is where you have to know price action to see the difference here‚Ä¶ many people assume that any sort of doji signifies an immediate reversal‚Ä¶ however, that does not actually always happen. More times than not I would say a downtrend with a gravestone doji actually results in a continuation pattern.   Few things to note here‚Ä¶ this is actually SPY and Futures fourth red day in a row‚Ä¶ that has not occurred since December 14th to 19th‚Ä¶ I would be a little surprised to see a 5th red day in a row but from a macro news stand point of the banking issues I could see it happening‚Ä¶   This doji candle today did come up and retest the daily 8/20ema and hard reject is and in addition to that we also have our first 8/20ema bearish crossover since February. Which if you remember started a nice 8% sell off on SPY.   &amp;#x200B;    From a weekly stand point on futures‚Ä¶ Bears NEED a closure under 4055 ideally but minimally under 4095‚Ä¶ bulls NEED a closure over 4095 minimally but ideally over 4110.  Futures daily levels    Supply- 4040 -&gt; 4055    Demand- 4085    Support- 4074 -&gt; 4055 -&gt; 4040    Resistance- 4085 -&gt; 4095 -&gt; 4110  **VIX**  &amp;#x200B;    We did not quite get the 20-30% VIX reaction I was expecting though we were up around 20% at the peak of the WAL news‚Ä¶ We are seeing two more rising wedges broken here and riding in a bull channel up now too‚Ä¶ The question remains is there enough news to push the VIX higher or much like April is this 20.1 level where the fear dies?   One big difference I see here is that the FG index is much much lower than last time the VIX was at these levels‚Ä¶ with the FG index at 50‚Ä¶ we have room to truly go either way.   **DAILY TRADING LOG**   &amp;#x200B;    I took a nice put swing based on some data that I had about FOMC meetings and post-FOMC day trends‚Ä¶ I sized heavily down but still pulled out a nice win‚Ä¶ I once again found myself getting ate up in opening hour‚Ä¶   Today was a very tough day to trade‚Ä¶ I felt like any time I finally found an entry the move was over, I also found myself more times than not waiting for confirmation that never came before the move happened. The very few times I did find confirmation I was left chasing premiums trying to get entries‚Ä¶ Its terribly tough to enter a trade when SPX premiums are moving $1 at a time‚Ä¶   Overall a good day of profits‚Ä¶ This week right now im sitting just under 2x my weekly goal‚Ä¶ one of my best weeks of trading this year‚Ä¶ actually as of now this is my 2nd most profitable week of trading this year‚Ä¶ If I am able to put in another good trading day tomorrow (profitable) I will be able to turn in my most profitable week of the year‚Ä¶  However, I have severely struggled trading Fridays lately so I do plan to go in lightly and nimbly using my tools‚Ä¶,;,; 2023-05-04 21:45:28]

[WTF is going on? (AAPL),;,; No seriously, it‚Äôs actually crazy how no one is talking about the fact that Apple is potentially in a highly dangerous position due to the Anti-Trust lawsuit against Google. You regards realize that this doesn‚Äôt just have implications for Google but will most likely seriously fuck up Apple too if the deal between them to default Google as a search engine is ruled as anticompetitive?  Apple nets $10-$20 BILLION a year just from setting Google as a default on devices and its browsers, and even if the district court doesn‚Äôt go nuclear and void the agreement, kneecapping Apple‚Äôs profits back to the stone age, it could demand that Apple pay out some or all of the money earned through that deal to competing search engines.

ADVERTISEMENTSCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT ‚ÄúAs we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future,‚Äù Cook said during a call with analysts. ‚ÄúThat includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we‚Äôre excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.‚Äù  Generative AI started drawing significant attention from technology companies and investors starting in 2022, after OpenAI released ChatGPT and image generators rapidly improved.

Apple typically announces new software in June at its annual developer‚Äôs conference, WWDC. Last year, the company announced an autocorrect feature for the iPhone keyboard based on a transformer-based language model, which shares the same underlying technology as GPT.

I believe Disney will announce a [strategic partner for ESPN]( in the **VERY** near future and there is overwhelming evidence suggesting that the strategic partner is APPLE.  I am not the only one. Analyst Dan Ives ($APPL) believes [a deal between ESPN and Apple is a "no brainer']( and has it on his 2024 predictions. Ives says an ESPN roll-up or major partnership ‚Äúwould make a ton of strategic sense‚Äù for Apple, helping it ‚Äúgain valuable sports content, major TV rights across each of the major professional and college sports packages, and change the cross-sell opportunities and attractiveness of Apple TV looking ahead while putting Apple on the sports map, globally speaking.‚Äù  **My price target is $110-$120** depending on ESPN's valuation. The street values ESPN at \~$30-$50bn on a standalone basis.  **Why the opportunity exists:**  Disney and Apple have a long, symbiotic relationship. This is largely due to Disney's collaboration and acquisition of Pixar from Apple in 2006 for $7.4bn. More importantly, Disney's CEO Bob Iger used to be on the board of Apple and Apple's CEO Tim Cook used to be on the board of Disney.  Disney wants to take ESPN direct to consumer. Iger has explicitly stated that Disney is ["in talks with a strategic partner that will provide marketing / distribution and possibly even content support.]( Further, he stated that "we are looking forward to sharing more information in the coming months". This is the catalyst.  Apple has long expressed an interest in getting into the sports content business. [This is evidenced]( by its investment in [MLB and MLS sports rights.]( But Apples not alone.

[Elon Musk goes off on Disney CEO Bob Iger, says he should be 'fired immediately',;,; [  &amp;#x200B;  Elon Musk isn't letting up in his beef with Disney CEO Bob Iger.  The X boss trashed Iger on Thursday, [writing on X]( (formerly Twitter) that he should be "fired immediately" and that Walt Disney himself is "turning in his grave over what Bob has done to his company."  Musk pounced on news that New Mexico's attorney general had [sued Meta]( and its CEO ‚Äî and longtime Musk rival ‚Äî Mark Zuckerberg.  The lawsuit alleges that Meta's social networks aren't doing enough to protect kids and that Instagram and Facebook were "not safe spaces for children but rather prime locations for predators to trade child pornography and solicit minors for sex," according to AG Ra√∫l Torrez.  One user on X pointed out that Disney was still advertising on Meta; the company recently [pulled ads from X]( after Musk supported an [antisemitic post](  Musk [chimed in]( (misspelling the Disney CEO's name): "Bob Eiger thinks it's cool to advertise next to child exploitation material. Real stand up guy."  When another user asked why Iger hadn't been fired yet, Musk replied: "He should be fired immediately."  He also responded to a news headline about his call for Iger's firing with one word: "truth."  Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment ahead of publication.  It's Musk's latest attack on an advertiser who fled his platform. At the New York Times' Dealbook summit, Musk had a succinct and vulgar response to companies that didn't want to give him money anymore: ["Go fuck yourself."](  At the event, Musk took the opportunity to single Iger out.  "Is that clear?" Musk asked. "I hope it is. Hey, Bob."  Earlier at the summit, the Disney CEO was asked about his company's decision to pull advertising on X.  "We know Elon is larger than life in many respects, and that his name is very much tied to the companies he either has founded or he owns, whether it's [Tesla]( or SpaceX or now X," Iger said.  Iger appeared to reference Musk's decision to boost an antisemitic tweet last month.  "By him taking the position that he took in quite a public manner, we just felt that the association with that position and Elon Musk and X was not necessarily a positive one for us," Iger said.  Musk faced an [onslaught of criticism]( over his post on X which called an antisemitic post the "absolute truth." Though, Musk later appeared to walk back his original comment, calling it "foolish."  Iger and Disney are one of many that Musk has taken aim at over the years.

[Americans Failed to Pay a Record $688 Billion in Taxes. The IRS Says That Will Change.,;,; Americans didn‚Äôt pay an estimated $688 billion in taxes due on their 2021 returns‚Äîthe largest shortfall ever. Audits and other enforcement will be stepped up to reduce the gap, the Internal Revenue Service said Thursday. The number includes $542 billion due to underreported income, with the remainder of the shortfall owed by those who didn‚Äôt file returns when they should have or never paid their bills. The total gap is up more than $138 billion from estimates for tax years 2017 to 2019. Much of the increase is due to economic growth. The IRS said there has also been a shift from wage income, for which taxes are withheld, to gig economy jobs, for which there is a lower degree of compliance. Taxpayers‚Äô overall compliance rate is projected to stay relatively steady at 86.3% for tax year 2021, after audits and other enforcement actions. The largest element of noncompliance, $182 billion, was attributable to undeclared business and farm income reported on Schedule C and F on individual returns. ‚ÄúThis increase in the tax gap underscores the importance of increased IRS compliance efforts on key areas,‚Äù said IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel in a statement.

[Insider Trading Weekly Update #032: Is Icahn Attempting an $SWX Takeover? | $APPL COO Sells ~28% of Stake | Insider Trading Recap,;,; GM WSB,  TL;DR - Feels like deja-vu, but the spotlight is once again on Oil with Buffett and Icahn buying more of $OXY and $SWX, respectively. Total insider trading activity declined this week, with \~50% declines in both purchases, sales, and insiders submitting Form 4 filings from the prior week.  The major drop in Consumer Staples is due to the Walton‚Äôs selling a small percentage of shares. They do this on a regular basis and are likely rewarded more through stock options.

[How to play tonight's AAPL Earnings safely,;,; Apple (AAPL), the king of the stock market, reports earnings is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter results after close today. Apple stock has not disappointed this year and the sturdiness of Apple‚Äôs returns simply cannot be understated. The stock is up 30% YTD, 300% over the last five years, and **1100% over the last 10 years**. It isn‚Äôt flawless though, as it was down -30% during 2022. However, it has nearly earned it all back in the first four months of 2023.   As the world‚Äôs leading consumer products and technology company, Apple‚Äôs earnings act as an important forerunner for the broader economy. What should we expect from Tim Apple?   Here‚Äôs what analysts think:  * Earnings: $1.43 per share, according to [Refinitiv](  * Revenue: $92.96 billion, according to Refinitiv  Revenue is expected to *decrease* 4.4% from $97.28 billion in the same quarter a year ago. This isn‚Äôt great, but also not terrible. Something I don‚Äôt often see mentioned about Apple is the strong seasonal tendencies of its revenues. [Take note of this chart.]( In the quarterly revenues, we see revenues regularly explode higher following the holiday season and are then mostly stagnant through the rest of the year. But Q1 2023 sales were below Q1 2022, which shows that there was a YoY slowdown in the most recent holiday season.  Apple prepared investors for a down quarter in January. The company hasn‚Äôt provided formal guidance since 2020, but it gives analysts and investors a number of data points that can be used to roughly estimate its performance.  The information it provided earlier this year suggested that sales would drop for a second straight quarter by roughly 5%. Sales of iPads and Macs are expected to see sharp decreases ‚Äî 12% and 25.4%, respectively ‚Äî and iPhone sales also likely dropped. Analysts polled by [FactSet]( expect annual declines in all of Apple‚Äôs hardware product lines.  The report comes as the PC and smartphone markets are mired in one of the worst slumps in recent years. Electronics sales are down sharply after many consumers bought new PCs and phones during the pandemic and others are tightening their belts because of high inflation or recession worries.  In the first quarter, PC shipments decreased 29%, [according to IDC]( while smartphone shipments were off 14%.  Apple‚Äôs report wraps up earnings season for tech‚Äôs mega-cap companies, after Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft all issued results last week. All four topped analyst estimates, though growth rates were still muted compared to prior years.  While Apple isn‚Äôt immune to the broader market slowdown, some analysts hope it will show strength and resiliency because it sells premium products and has loyal customers. Refinitiv consensus estimates suggest Apple could guide back to growth. They expect 2% expansion in the third quarter. But others are concerned that revenue will keep falling, suggesting that demand for Apple‚Äôs products is eroding.  Does anyone know Samik Chatterjee, the analyst at JPMorgan? He mentioned in a note this week that the "eventual outcome might be simply driven by F3Q guidance, where investors might be looking for assurance and visibility into limited downside despite a tough macro.‚Äù See, if Apple‚Äôs outlook suggests a year-over-year decline that‚Äôs less than 5%, Apple could still ‚Äútriumph‚Äù on fundamentals, at least according to Chatterjee.  Along with earnings, Apple is also likely to update investors on its [capital return authorization]( Analysts expect the iPhone maker to announce plans to spend as much as $90 billion on share repurchases and dividends.  **What about the Technicals?**  There isn‚Äôt a clean chart pattern to trade AAPL from, [but this large range looks significant]( The $180 level is resistance and $130 support. Right now, price is in no-mans land in the middle of this large range.  If price can clear the $180 level, resistance should turn into support, and the next multi-year leg higher in Apple should commence. However, a rejection at $180 would be very significant. If the stock can‚Äôt clear that level, it may be indicative of not just Apple, but the market more broadly.  With a recession likely coming later this year, it is possible we will see Apple retest the high of the range, and then as the recession takes hold, swing back down to the bottom of the range. Rather than trying to short the stock, investors would be better off waiting for price to come back down to the $130-$140 buy zone.  **Valuation??**  The price of Apple is currently 28 times its one-year forward profits, which is higher than both the market average and its five-year median price of 24 times. Despite being one of the most respected companies in the world, this valuation is neither particularly high nor low. The bears don't have a good time with this fair assessment.  **What to do for Earnings?**  Apple is a juggernaut in the stock market, and its supremacy is undeniable. Apple brought luxury to the masses, so if the average person begins to feel the heat of a slowing economy, they probably won‚Äôt be buying a new iPhone. Does this mean puts for earnings? We know the stock moves on average 5 ¬± 3% with earnings. However last quarter, it moved +7%, the one before it was +9% and the one before it was +6%. Wait, so calls? I'm thinking a strangle. I'm going to bet that while it moves on average 5%, it's going to move more, without attempting to predict whether it's going up or down. So I'll be buying AAPL 5/5 160p (at 138 bucks) and 170c (at 150 bucks). This means you can get the strangle for $288. The stock would have to move 4.6% up or 5.1% down to break even. Mind you, this post is not financial or investment advice - consider it as just me offering some education based on what analysts tend to look for in a company when it's time to make a last minute earnings prediction. In fact, just because I'm posting it, AAPL might just stay flat.,;,; 2023-05-04 18:55:29]

[$ARM - Capitalize off the Rug Pull,;,; As with most IPOs, ARM is overvalued as fuck. Share lockup expires on 3.12.24, and a lot of regards here are waiting until then to buy puts. They will miss out on **HUGE** gains. The play is: ~~FDs~~ **OTM puts expiring 12/15**. I will explain why in this post:  (Skip to end for TL;DR if you can't read -- this is long)  &amp;#x200B;  **1. Fundamentals**  ARM has not mooned **40%** from its lows because of its fundamentals.  PE Ratio: 172.4  Forward PE: 66.3 - Over 2.5x NVDAs FW PE.  Forward PS: 21.6 -- This one is especially regarded.  Price/Book - 14.4  A rudimentary look into their numbers shows that the company is probably overvalued by 60-70%. High margin tech companies (which ARM is not) have a trailing Price/Sales of around 6-7. I'd expect that it will probably dump under $25/share by the end of 2024, at MINIMUM. Because things get even worse from here.  Most IPOs have prospects of incredible growth, which shrouds their suspect fundamentals. ARM doesn't have that luxury, as it is oversaturated in many of its markets -- and unable to significantly expand in others.  "We have maintained market share in the mobile applications processor market of greater than 99% for many years". They can't grow in the smartphone market, and the industry itself is not projected to grow much in the near future.   "Our market share in the IoT and embedded chip market has grown from 58.4% as of December 31, 2020 to 64.5% as of December 31, 2022". Growth, but not the type of growth you look for at a P/B over 14.  "Our market share in the cloud compute market has grown from 7.2% as of December 31, 2020 to 10.1% as of December 31, 2022". They have potential to expand more in this market, but they aren't projecting that they'll be able to do so.   \^ All from their F-1.   Because ARMs chips are traditionally more efficient and thus have less power than Intel's x86 architecture, they don't have the current ability to expand in these more lucrative markets that require beefier processors. They already completely control the market in smartphones -- which would be good for them, **if they actually made money off it:**  [Apple makes up less than 5% of Arm's revenue, and Arm can't do anything about it - 9to5Mac](   Some highlights:  "Despite Apple‚Äôs reliance on Arm as the instruction set for iPhone chips, **Arm earns less than 5% of its annual revenue from Apple**."  "Apple pays Arm ‚Äú**less than 30 cents per device** for the right to use Arm-based chips in the hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads, Macs and Apple Watches it sells each year"  "At one point, Son called Apple CEO Tim Cook to tell him Arm would be raising prices for all its major smartphone and chip customers. **Cook‚Äôs team reassured him that Arm couldn‚Äôt raise fees, because the companies‚Äô contract at the time lasted through 2028**. Son backed off. Since then, Apple and Arm have been through several rounds of negotiations that have kept the financial terms of Apple‚Äôs deal largely in place, people familiar with the matter said."   Yep, that's Masayoshi Son, trying to fuck up yet another company.   ARM's business model is DOGSHIT. They make miniscule amounts off of incredibly lucrative technology, AND THEY CAN'T CHANGE THAT. They have no leverage, because all of their deals are already in place. *And here's the kicker:*  **"In the meantime, Apple has explored the long-term possibility of using a competing technology in the chips for its devices, according to one former Apple employee."**  They are talking about **RISC-V** \-- the OPEN-SOURCE architecture BASED OFF ARM (Advanced **RISC** Machines) architecture. "RISC-V is provided under royalty-free open-source licenses" (Wikipedia).   In simple terms: ARM is a monopoly, but in the future (think 8-15 years) they will be **DISPLACED BY ROYALTY FREE OPEN-SOURCE LICENSING.** Why the fuck would you want to own this company long term, when they will become irrelevant in a decade? This is a ticking time bomb.  &amp;#x200B;  **2. Gy-na**  I'll keep this part more succinct. ARM DOESN'T OWN ARM China, from which they get **25%** **of their revenue**:  [Arm's China relationship complicates IPO | Reuters](   Highlights:  **"Arm itself holds an effective interest of only 4.8% in Arm China."**  "Arm said in its filings that "in the past, **we have received late payments** from Arm China and have **had to expend company resources to obtain payments from Arm China**.""  "24% of revenue came from Arm China in the fiscal year ended March 31, but **40% of accounts receivable were attributed to China**, meaning **Arm has still not been paid** for all products sold in China."  So, ARM China is a separate entity despite the name, and they only pay ARM when they feel like it. ARM literally has to pay debt collectors to fly over and get ARM China to fork over money. **What happens when ARM China decides that they don't want to pay at all?**   &amp;#x200B;  **3. Timing**  I hope I've established that ARM is a complete dumpster fire. But this could go higher short-term, right? Why am I saying that the stock will dump this specific week?  The Oompa Loompas on stocktwits are disgustingly bullish on this stock. They had been waiting for yesterday -- a breakout above the closing price on IPO day -- as an entry point (despite the fact that there has already been a substantial move up). Well, how did they enter?   [Huge call volume coincided with 8&amp;#37; pump on 12\/8](  I'll tell you how: they all bought calls **expiring this week**. In fact, that alone is likely what caused the breakout, as options sellers had to hedge against these morons piling in.   As we all know, options are a zero-sum game. You regards especially know full well that options sellers usually come out on top -- why not take their side for once? Now that dumb money has all jumped into the same boat, they'll sink it.   There are a couple technical lines of interest. The support at $61 (closing price on 9/15) is support. That will break. There's another at $60, and that may hold for this week. But if it fails, this is drilling to $55 -- a long term resistance before the initial breakout, which is conveniently also max pain.  (Additionally, I expect the broader market to fall this week due to FOMC / dot plot not showing as many cuts as the market wants / Hawkish Powell. This is a nice way to combine two theses.)  [Fun with Crayons: First exit under $61, but $55 is possible.](  &amp;#x200B;  **4. Strategy**  I have 12.15 64Ps, as well as 4.19.24 65Ps in anticipation for the longer-term dump.   The way to play this is to target any strike (or combination) from 65 to 60, doesn't really matter which. I honestly think that the 50s are possible, but this stock has a really fucking high beta and it could have a dead cat bounce -- so you should sell some when it breaks $61.   Buying at open is the best strategy, as this thing has been making its daily move in the first hour(s) of the day recently. However, I also wouldn't be surprised if it goes sideways/up on Monday/Tuesday, so there's potential to just wait until Tuesday close to buy. CPI fuckery is what I'm specifically worried about. Wednesday through Friday should be blood red, so getting in before then is crucial for maximizing returns.  &amp;#x200B;  **TL;DR: ARM is a turd of a company, and retail has just piled into calls. Buy weekly OTM puts to capitalize off the imminent rug pull that this stock is going to suffer.**   Not financial advice. ,;,; 2023-12-09 23:10:13]

[The market is collapsing,;,;  ###HOW YOU LIKE THEM APPLES B*TCHES ###CRASH COMIN BABY CHUUUUU CHUUUUUU       EDIT: AS I SAID AT THE BOTTOM , I am NOT calling the top.    The US economy is fucked. Housing is slowly collapsing, rent price are also slowly declining. Goods and services are now extremely overpriced  even when accounting for inflation.  I am a truck driver, and let me tell you how I see things from the road.  Before the pandamic and this huge rise in costs, loads were paying about 3 dollars a mile when diesel was 2-3 dollars a gallon (even 1-2 dollars in some places) During COVID, people were getting 4-5 dollars a miles per load, while diesel was still 2-3 dollars a gallon.  Now it's about 2-3 dollars per mile, and diesel is 4-7 dollars.   Solo drivers used to dominate the road. Now, companies are specifically seeking team only operations (2 drivers in one truck) to order to  offset the cost of the fuel and also the decline/stagnation in pay rate from brokers/shippers.  In some places in the country, truckers are barely getting enough money from the loads to cover basic expenses.   The market does what it wants , correct. But the collapse is coming, and it WILL NOT  be a soft landing.   the Yellow Cab trucking company was the first big one to go under, and they were not the first and won't be the last.  Smaller companies and owner operators have been getting wiped off the map for almost 2 years now. The last 2 people I worked for had to close down shop.   What does that mean for you?  Trucking is the only way everyone in the country can have access to goods AND services that use any kind of tools or materials. If we are losing money and work, it will soon translate into you and the companies you work for, going down the same path.

[$MASI ($AAPL‚Äôs current nemesis),;,; What do we think about $MASI (the company responsible for Apple halting sales of their watches due to claims of Apple ripping off their patents on blood O2 sensor). Currently $6B market cap could easily see Apple having to pay out several times more than that to settle with them.  This is a multi year long case that seems to be coming to fruition fast. Overall the chart looks bullish (not saying much with everything bullish rn) but they have other tech and products so this isn‚Äôt just a pure play on the Apple case - meaning if the case fails I don‚Äôt see the stock dumping solely because of it.   What do we think? Terrible spreads on their options but 1/19/24s are well after the 12/25 date the White House has to figure shit out with the current restrictions.

[DD: Scary Fast to a Recession Next Year,;,; # Introduction  Obvious Note: This post is not financial advice. Quite honestly, I'm not even sure how solid this thought process is, and am open to contrarian views to my own.  **tl:dr:** AAPL averted crisis for now, but I think that the Scary Fast event was done out of real fear, and it means that a correction will come by EoQ12024 for QQQ and possibly SPY - trust me, this makes sense, please read.  I actually had puts on AAPL for the last few weeks, and the Scary Fast event basically wrecked my Puts for earnings week, so take the research and opinions below with this bias in mind.  # Tim can Cook: Pivoting back to the 30Day Mean  Right before earnings (Oct26), it looked as if AAPL was going to continuously breach the lower end of its 30day 2St.D. Bollinger Band: for amateur Astrologists like myself, this is often a pattern that we see when the market believes that there is going to be a massive downside correction to a stock's price, as upside price movements often come smoothly ("escalator up, elevator down").  It wasn't only the chart, the stories in the news also agrees:  1. Apple facing massive risk over its China supply chain due to Foxconn being audited by the CCP: [ 2. Apple's sales of Macs shrinking YoY: [ 3. Apple's bread and butter (iPhone) facing increased risks in both its largest overseas market (Greater China area), due to breakthroughs by Huawei on new chips made by SMIC (China's domestic semiconductor manufacturer) affecting demand: [  Given this, Apple's price has gone all the way from its ATH of \~$196.45 on Jul31st, to breaching below 200DMA and below 30Day bollinger band: \~$166.89 on Oct26th.  Seeing both the ink on the newspapers and the crayons on the stock chart, Tim then ControlledTheNarrative (haaaa, I hope he's doing ok tho) and made everyone prepare for a product announcement event right before earnings - fuck them employees being able to spend time with their kids on costumes amirite?  The thing is: it worked.  # Scaring the Bears on Halloween  The event addressed the fears of investors with the following announcements, directly targeting the news points above:  1. The new M3 chip, and its increased speed and capabilities (assuaging fear 3): Although these chips only are hitting the new Macs now, we all know that Apples' chip improvements will eventually reach all of its products. (source: [ 2. new MacBook Pros with said M3 chip (assuaging fear 2): Not only did Apple directly strike at the investors' worry of lagging Mac sales, they also made it a fashion statement by creating a new, cool, modern color for it. This move will ensure that demand will be high for those who treat Apple products as a status symbol, as they have done for the iPhone in the past. (source: [  However, just to be safe (these are all according to Ming-Chi Kuo):  1. Apple has long been working on a iPhone SE 4: [ 2. 2024 budget MacBook is currently under consideration: [ 3. Apple is also working on an AirPods 4, which is going to be budget-friendly: [  *\*\*\*These three points are important, and we're going to circle back to that in a bit.\*\*\**  # The Market Helps Those Who Help Themselves  But the event was a massive success. In the week before earnings, Apple reverted upwards from $166.89 to $177.57, and only went down to $176.65 after earnings. Apple deserves that dub and I hope they take it to the bank as quickly as they made that event.  To Eiffel Tower the bears even more, Jerome Powell, coincidentally armed with an iPad just \~a month prior, announced that there will not be a rate hike, contributing to Apple's valuation boner above.  However, my bet is that it won't last.  # Apple's History: Reaching Down During Bad Times  Note how in the 3 points above regarding the iPhone SE4, MB, and AirPods 4, Apple is reaching down to the budget market. Historically, Apple has only done that when they smell trouble:  1. iPhone 5c was released in Sep2013    1. AAPL dropped from \~$26 to a low of \~$15 from Sept2012 to July2013    2. QQQ was at \~$68.23 in Apr2012, and did not exceed that consistently until Apr2013 2. iPhone SE was released Mar2016    1. AAPL dropped from \~$33 to a low of \~$23 from May2015 to Mar2016    2. QQQ was at \~$114 at Jul2015, and did not exceed that consistently until Jul2016 3. iPhone SE2 was released right at the start of the pandemic, and the stock would've seen action similar to above had PapaPowell'sPrinter and his trusty iPad hadn't snipped our currency with his printer ala Nero. 4. iPhone SE3 released in Mar2022, right when the post-printer correction was beginning to happen.    1. AAPL dropped from \~$182 from Jan2022, and did not exceed that until Jun2023.    2. QQQ was at ATH in Jan2022, and was at post-pandemic low by Jan2023.  Apple is now doing iPhone SE4, new entry-level MB, new budget airpods all in 2024. I have no idea what breakfast Apple's economists eat, but if Apple's product rumors are any indication, we will be in more economic pain in the months to come.  # My Guess For the Future  *Side note: S&amp;P500 does not have +6% weeks during real bull markets. Real bull markets are gradual growth and consistent day-over-day and week-over-week results.*  Do I have positions yet? No, to be honest, I think options are overpriced in general right now and I don't want to short stock or sell naked calls, but if I had to make target prices right now, it's going to be:  AAPL \~$170 target price by EoY, with more corrections to come in 2024.  SPY &lt;$400 by EoY, again with more downside in 2024.  QQQ &lt;$345 by EoY, and you guessed it, more downside in 2024.  Will post positions by EoY if these price targets come true, right now this is just a precursor hypothesis.     EDIT: formatting and slight corrections.,;,; 2023-11-06 06:42:02]
[Anyone buying AAPL calls before WWDC,;,; apple is about to announce product which may lead to a big stock increase  Given the recent rumors of Apple's highly anticipated VR headset announcement on June 5th, there has been speculation regarding market interest in purchasing Apple call options. This is because Apple has historically experienced significant stock price increases upon the release of new products, especially those that break new ground in their respective markets.  For example, Apple's first iPhone release in 2007 revolutionized the smartphone industry and generated a lot of excitement and anticipation. In the months leading up to the announcement, there was a lot of buzz around the product, and this was reflected in the company's stock price. On the day of the announcement, Apple's stock jumped 8%, and continued to rise in the following weeks, resulting in a 25% increase in the company's market cap.  Similarly, the release of the iPad in 2010 generated a lot of hype and speculation, and Apple's stock price saw a substantial increase in the months leading up to the announcement. On the day of the announcement, Apple's stock rose 1.2% and continued to rise in the following weeks, leading to a 12% increase in the company's market cap.  More recently, the announcement of the Apple Watch in 2014 generated a lot of buzz and excitement, and the company's stock price saw a significant increase in the weeks leading up to the announcement. On the day of the announcement, Apple's stock rose 2.7%, and continued to rise in the following weeks, resulting in a 9% increase in the company's market cap.  Given Apple's track record of producing innovative and groundbreaking products, it is plausible that the rumored VR headset announcement could have a similar effect on the company's stock price. The market may be anticipating a substantial increase in demand for the product, which could translate into higher revenue and earnings for Apple. Additionally, with Apple's reputation for consistently improving upon its products, there is optimism among investors that the VR headset will be well-received and help to solidify Apple's position as a leader in the technology industry.  As a result, there may be market interest in purchasing Apple call options in anticipation of a potential rise in the company's stock price following the announcement. Early indications suggest that Apple's VR headset may contain cutting-edge technology, such as eye-tracking sensors and advanced haptic feedback, which could make it a game-changer in the VR market. If the rumors are true and the product lives up to expectations, Apple's stock price may experience a significant boost in the coming weeks.,;,; 2023-06-01 23:00:58]

Automakers have already been making the transition which has led to cost savings in the manufacturing process. Apple is even testing the tech for their titanium iwatches.

[My employee called me a üåàüêª and then quit,;,; So, I‚Äôm a supervisor at Wendy‚Äôs and I had a 1 to 1 with one of my more problematic employees. This kid was a full charity case diversity hire, it might be an adult, but it has the mental age of a 4 year old and ticked nearly every box for learning and mental disabilities. It‚Äôs so bad I struggle to believe it‚Äôs human, it‚Äôs full on regarded in every sense of the word. I don‚Äôt know how, but it somehow managed to operate the till and thinks that‚Äôs the height of modern technology, so much so that it thinks Wendy‚Äôs is a global tech giant about to take on Apple.  Anyway, during our 1 to 1 I wanted to try to relate to this thing a little bit better. I know it‚Äôs interested in the market (it talks about shorting Apple all the time because it will make the difference in ensuring Wendy‚Äôs outperforms them) and this was just as the interest rate decision was going to be made and all of a sudden this thing shouts at me, ‚Äúoh shit you‚Äôre a üåàüêª too?!?‚Äù. Now, on the side I may or may not have been embezzling money from Wendy‚Äôs and may or may not be down $128k. To say I‚Äôm f-ed is an understatement. I may or may not have been shorting BTC because it‚Äôs obviously a Ponzi. Now, say what you will but as long as I can keep this secret long enough, I will hit the jackpot. I‚Äôve gone with 4x 0DTE OTM options because I know it will eventually collapse, and when that happens this will be the best way to profit from it. They‚Äôre virtually free and will pay off millions. It‚Äôs only logical.  Anyway, now I‚Äôm freaking out that it figured out what I was doing. So, I‚Äôve got to fire him right but I need HRs approval. I tell it that, and it suddenly mumbles some random incoherent mess at me and quits! I was honestly relieved, I no longer had to deal with it, my secret is safe, and I can now fire the guy I pay to wipe this things bottom after it sh*ts. I never liked that guy, but funnily enough no one wants to wipe for other people.  Problem is though, now this thing is hiding out behind the dumpster at the back of the shop. Is it trying to ambush me? I‚Äôve tried calling the police since it‚Äôs trespassing, but I can‚Äôt get it to go away. It keeps telling me it can offer me a good time for $20. Is that code for telling me it knows I‚Äôve been making $20 bets on BTC using Wendy‚Äôs money?  In hindsight, I don‚Äôt actually think it‚Äôs smart enough to know what I‚Äôm doing, so it was probably an overreaction. But I am still paranoid about it all.  Is anyone able to provide some advice on what to do with this thing? I don‚Äôt need any investing advice, I‚Äôve got it all under control.  Edit:  I think my employee might also be active on this in.

[Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,;,; From [Investopedia](  "Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.  KEY TAKEAWAYS Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.  The company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.  Previously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.  The move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.  Apple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release.   The company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.  The company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.   The new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).   Apple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.   So far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.  Apple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year.   In each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.  Apple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed."  Personally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.,;,; 2023-03-28 09:43:30]

[In-Depth Analysis: Apple's AAPL Stock Performance and Underperformance in the AI Race,;,; I've been studying Apple's recent financial performance and found some points of concern. Despite their significant revenue, they have seen a decline in gross margin percentage, from 38.2% in 2017 to 37.6% in 2020. This could be indicative of increased production costs or decreased pricing power.   Furthermore, they have been spending heavily on share buybacks, with a total of $73.2 billion in 2020 alone. While this may boost earnings per share in the short term, it's also indicative of a potential lack of more productive investment opportunities.   In addition, while Apple's been investing in AI, they seem to be lagging behind competitors like Google and OpenAI. While they have made some acquisitions in the space, they have yet to make significant strides, which raises concerns about their ability to keep pace in this rapidly evolving field.   I believe it's important for us as investors to critically assess these companies, especially ones as influential as Apple.,;,; 2023-05-24 18:39:59]

But my Roth is a closed system at this point, since my earnings don‚Äôt allow me to contribute anymore. So I can only work with what I have in the account ($125k). Other holdings are FZROX and AAPL (at a low basis that I‚Äôll hold).  Would you take the ~$9k profit in TSLA and index it, or just let it ride based on your opinion of the company‚Äôs future? I‚Äôm not very bullish on it, and curious what others think.,;,; 2024-02-09 16:03:54]
[Warren Buffett built a $107 billion net worth through investing. Every year since 1965 he‚Äôs written an annual letter showing us how he did it.,;,; **Here are 10 investing lessons from Warren Buffett:**  **1. What you own**   What and how you invest matters.   Buffett focuses on businesses with great management and economic advantages.   The key word is business.   Buffett isn‚Äôt a stock picker.   He calls himself a business picker.  &amp;#x200B;  **2. Diversification**   Just because you‚Äôre diversified doesn‚Äôt mean you have less risk.   And just because you have a concentrated position doesn‚Äôt mean you have more risk.   Concentrating on a few stocks can decrease your risk if it means you‚Äôll pay more attention to the business.  &amp;#x200B;  **3. Market pricing**   Buffett says a stock price shouldn‚Äôt determine whether you buy or sell.   In the short term, people vote with their dollars on which stocks will do well.   In the long term, stocks with the most value tend to do well.  &amp;#x200B;  **4. Be greedy when others are fearful**   When money is cheap, hold on to it.   When money is expensive, invest it.   Every so often doom and gloom will hit the stock market.   This is your chance to run towards it with wads of cash.   Instead of running away with pennies on the dollar.  &amp;#x200B;  **5. Buy businesses that reinvest in themselves**   If it‚Äôs a great company, with great management, and great profits‚Ä¶   Why wouldn‚Äôt they reinvest in themselves?   This creates an element of compound interest.   Except instead of your returns compounding, it‚Äôs business operations.  &amp;#x200B;  **6. Prioritize moat**   If a business model produces high profits, there will be competition.   Businesses that thrive like this have one thing in common:   A moat.   A moat doesn‚Äôt only keep them profitable, but it keeps them in competition long term.   This is crucial for investors.  &amp;#x200B;  **7. Buy boring businesses**   Especially if they sell products/services people need.   Boring businesses provide stability and longevity to your portfolio.   This allows you to make money for longer periods of time.  &amp;#x200B;  **8. Invest like a sloth**   ‚ÄúFor investors as a whole, returns decrease as motions increase.‚Äù   Most investors would make more money if they bought and held instead of buying and trading.   This applies to rebalancing too.   Here‚Äôs what I mean‚Ä¶  &amp;#x200B;  **9. Rebalancing your portfolio**   Most people trim a position once it gets large.   Buffett does the opposite.   Selling positions that have become too big is the same as the bulls trading Michael Jordan because he‚Äôs become too good.   Don‚Äôt sell your winners.   Let them run.  &amp;#x200B;  **10. Time and business**   Time is a friend of great businesses but an enemy of the mediocre.   Just because a company does well short term doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs sustainable.   ‚ÄúWhen the tide goes out, you‚Äôll see who‚Äôs been swimming naked.‚Äù   This isn't just investors.   It's businesses too.,;,; 2023-06-29 16:13:25]
[Analysis tool question: how can I look at my portfolio, which has multiple ETFs, and assess % of individual stocks across whole portfolio? Is there software that can do this?,;,; My portfolio consists of mutual funds, lots of ETFs, and individual stocks.    While I know my allocation across the asset classes &amp; market segments (e.g. stocks, bonds, xUS, small cap, mid cap, small cap, utilities, tech etc etc etc) I'd like to get more granular.    Like, I have no idea how much AAPL I own.  I own multiple ETFs that include AAPL but no idea what my actual total ownership is.    *(Note: yes, I know that owning an ETF is not the same as owning the stock ... I'm just looking for "equivalent net effective ownership" I guess you could say.  Basically just trying to assess my exposure to different individual companies across all my ETFs.)*  Is there any software that I can input my whole portfolio and it can then break everything down in terms of "OK, across all your ETFs, individual stocks, etc ... you "effectively own" $50K of AAPL, 42K of XYZ, 31K of ABC, etc."  My assets are in Schwab and Fidelity ... I've played around and I can't seem to make these sites give me this breakdown.  They can analyze a few ways, but they can't seem to "break open" the ETF to say "yes, you own $100K of SPY ... but that means you effectively own $3K of AAPL" or whatever.  I know I could go into every single ETF fact sheet and pull out the percentages and do the math myself, but this would be a ton of work.,;,; 2023-08-05 23:29:33]
[Apple iPhone sales drop more than forecast, revenue falls for third straight quarter - Yahoo Finance,;,; [   Apple (AAPL) announced its fiscal Q3 earnings after the bell on Thursday, reporting iPhone sales that missed analysts' expectations while **revenue fell 1.4% over last year, the third straight quarter of declines.** About half of the company's overall revenue comes from its iPhone segment.        On Friday, Apple stock was down 2% in premarket trading, as the tech giants gloomy results contributed to it's share price decline.        Revenue has slid for multiple quarters at the tech giant as Mac and iPad sales have flagged. On a call with analysts Apple CFO Luca Maestri said **the company expects revenue for these products to fall by double digits from last year**, citing pent-up demand from the prior year quarter after factory shutdowns.        Services did better however my big question is if this really can compensate if Apple's hardware sales keep slumping? Quite frankly i don't understand why people keep buying the same iphone every year or maybe they no longer do? It's time Apple steps up its iphone and other hardware innovation instead of just repackaging the same thing every year with minor-to-no updates.  PS. anybody else would wanna see a macbook (pro) **with touchscreen**? Personally i love my Dell XPS 13 4K with touchscreen and love the dimensions are only 30x20cm. Would love to see Apple making something similar. ,;,; 2023-08-04 11:16:50]
[Anyone else regret only investing in 401k and not stocks?,;,; For the past 8 years I've been maxing out my retirement accounts and I'm currently sitting on about 350k in retirement savings (401k and Roth IRA) at 30 because that's what r/personalfinance recommended to do. However I'm coming to the point where I want to buy a home in a year or two, and I'm realizing most of my savings is in retirement accounts and not easily accessible to me. Especially seeing stocks like AAPL and NVDA over the past decade, I'm kicking myself for not investing a good chunk in a few individual stocks a while ago which would have helped me raise a good cash savings today. My options now for raising a downpayment are either withdrawing my Roth IRA contributions, take a loan against my 401k, or saving it slowly the hard way, none of which are ideal. So this is more a warning to young people to not blindly follow advice to max out your retirement accounts, because you may have other short term goals (house, etc.) that come up that may require a chunk of savings to be available. Feel free to throw some money (only what you're willing to lose) at some individual stocks that interest you as well and don't limit yourself to just index funds.,;,; 2024-02-07 18:03:41]

[Rebalancing Portfolio Suggestions,;,; I decided to really start investing about a decade ago. I opened a Roth IRA and have fully funded it every year. I contribute 5% of my check to a 403(b) that is matched at 10%. I had no credit card debt. I have an emergency fund (HYSA). Car is paid for. Small amount left on a 15 year fixed house loan at around 3%. I put $8,400 into a "catch up" Roth 403(b) a year.    Seven years ago I had some money to invest that I could afford to lose, so I put it in APPL. This is now roughly 45% of my portfolio. This is too high and no longer in the realm of money I can afford to lose.    I was thinking of selling some of the AAPL each year to finish out the Roth 403(b). I'm in my 50s so can contribute up to $30k a year. I make ~$70k a year.    It would literally take me like ten or eleven years to sell all of my AAPL stock at this rate, but it seems like a great way to reduce my taxable income and to lock in some long term gains.    I know the money I put into the Roth 403(b) will be locked up, but that seems fine by me.  What am I missing?,;,; 2024-01-08 18:01:56]

[Analysis of an Analyst Raising Apple target to $190,;,; Full Article: [  Essentially in his forecast driven by high iPhone demand in china and steady sales in January through February, Market Analyst Dan Ives reiterated the outperform rating he‚Äôs had on Apple for at least the past three years. He raised his stock-price target to $190 from $180, with the new target implying about 25% upside from current levels. Why so optimistic? Is that realistic? And if so over what time frame are we talking here?  My analysis is mainly being drawn from [this data here]( (great resource for well compiled company data) as well as my knowledge of the company and other articles I've perused during this endeavor.  The synopsis forecast on the stock report card linked is: "41 analysts offer 12-month price forecasts for AAPL. Together, they have an average target of 179.88, the most optimistic forecast put AAPL at 210 within 12-months and the most pessimistic has AAPL at 140."  Their recent low came at the end of December after [pretty bad holiday sales]( but those seem to mainly have been do to continued production disruption rather than low demand. This was also the only quarter in the last 20 in which they have missed earnings. So I would argue these are strong indicators that we won't be seeing it drop to 140.  Apple is also diversifying its supply chain so over time and without another pandemic, those disruptions should become less frequent and impactful.  Like I mentioned before, this isn't the only article I've seen recently where analysts are targeting Apple for the $190 to $210 range and I think if there is any solid movement on the rumored AR headset or (much less likely) the Apple Car, we could easily see a rally over the next year or two, to the proposed prices.  Last year apple hit a high of $179 so it wasn't far off from this target. Even with all the tech layoffs and seeming bubble bursting of that sector, Apple hasn't had. mass layoffs and is still increasing its historic and investor friendly [stock buyback program](  Most of the company's prospects are good and they get a solid B rating in the report card above, but they have been very volatile over the last year (volatility grade of C) going from a one year high of 179 and a low of around 125.  I definitely think they as a company can reach those targets, but I wonder if they can reach them in the proposed 12 month time frame given current market conditions. Tech is being rocked, interest rates are going to keep going up for a while now, inflation has been hurting consumers and I wonder if demand for big ticket items like iPhones/macs will continue even if they don't raise prices (which I don't think they will or need to). If anyone can weather the storm of pending recession its Apple, but will they continue to be a beacon of growth during this time and reach these targets despite the rest of the market or are they going to trade sideways for a while and only break out when the rest of the market also starts to rally? What do you think? Especially curious to hear from others who have a solid amount of Apple in their portfolio?,;,; 2023-03-08 23:20:19]
[What US taxes are US non residents required to pay for owning or selling stocks of US companies?,;,; So, the question is in the title.

[Query - What has more impact on an index like NASDAQ-100?,;,; NASDAQ-100 closed at 12302.48 yesterday. The previous close was 12290.81. So it gained 11.67 points yesterday. Now percentage wise, the highest price gain was by Enphase Energy, Inc. (ENPH) 3.77% 1.11 Billion, but the increase in market capitalization was highest by Apple (AAPL) 1.85%  41.5 Billion.   According to Wikipedia, NASDAQ-100 is "modified capitalization-weighted index." So am I right in my inference that though ENPH went up by 3.77%, this would have a much lesser impact on the index price than AAPL going up by 1.85%?     Similarly, Dexcom (DXCM) was the biggest loser at -7.87% (-3.63 B), but Tesla was biggest loser as per market cap -2.01% ( -13.98 B).     Smaller changes in bigger companies ( by market cap ) impacts the index more.  Would this be a correct assumption?,;,; 2023-03-07 09:16:57]

[What happened in the world late 2020?,;,; I am new to the investing and still have some questions that might be obvious to other people. So lately I noticed that stocks of some well known companies (AAPL, TSLA, NVDA and etc), indexes  (SPX, DJI) and even BTC went up significantly around at the and of 2020.

[How diversified is too diversified?,;,; I just analyzed my portfolio. I'm 95% in index funds (15% international, the rest split between small, mid, and large cap growth and value) and 5% in ARK funds. By looking at the top 30 holdings of each of the funds I own, I have calculated that my 2 largest single stock positions are AAPL and MSFT, both less than 2%. No other single stock is even 1% of my portfolio.      One goal as an index fund investor was to be as diversified as possible, and it seems that I have achieved that. But now 70% of my portfolio is held in very tiny slices of companies spread across the world, none of which appear in the top 30 holdings of any of the funds I own. Hmm.

[Advice for diversifying portfolio,;,; I recently started investing in stocks I understood and analysed myself by consistently DCAing every week for the past year.     Currently, my portfolio is:   TSLA = 11.90%   AAPL = 28.78%   AMZN = 15.18%   GOOGL = 8.33%   MSFT = 24.65%   INTC = 11.17%   KO = 1.43%     My problem is, I understand these stocks and trust these companies. But I know that I should be more diverse with investments.

[My strategy has been "wrong" for the last decade (Intl vs US). Will I continue to be wrong in the next decade?,;,; I made a decision 10+ years ago to invest heavily in international. IXUS is my largest holding. My logic at the time was that since I live and work in the U.S., international investing would be a bit of a hedge. International was also much cheaper on about every metric CAPE, PE, P/B etc. as it remains today.  Of course I've only gotten punished for my decision since then with the U.S. continuing to outperform. But when I bat around the idea of making changes now I find it hard to swallow that the U.S. will continue to outperform again for another 10 years. Am I crazy to stick with a portfolio heavily weighted towards intl?  I've got Fidelity ETFs but I'm sure the numbers are close for Vanguard:  IXUS: P/E of 13, yield of 2.3%, P/B of 1.7  ITOT: P/E of 21, yield of 1.4%, P/B of 3.7  Like what is more likely, the rest of the world seeing 50% multiple expansion to get to a P/E of 19.5 or the U.S. seeing the same to get to a PE of 31.5 or choose your own favorite scenario/metric. Maybe the numbers would get a little closer if you were to strip out the high flyers like AAPL, NVDA, TSLA, etc. I have been building out a position in SCHD to help get a little more balance but am I nuts to stay the course?   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;   ,;,; 2023-08-16 20:30:06]
[Difference between Purchasing Options on Different Brokerages,;,; Apart from the brokerage's own limitations and/or perks, is there a difference when you purchase options from one brokerage site compared to another? For instance, if I purchase AAPL call options on Robinhood compared to E-Trade or Ameritrade, will there be a difference in implied volatility, open interest, volume, and/or bid-ask spread?

[7 years from $0 to $100k, 3 years from $100k to $200k,;,; I joined eTrade in 2013 a few years after graduating college. I had set up automatic monthly contributions to my accounts, which I slowly raised over time and mostly invested in blue chip stocks.   On December 1, 2020, the combined value of my Roth and Traditional Brokerage account was just over $100k. It took me over seven years to get there and was a major milestone.  In the past three years, I have raised my monthly contributions, continued to invest, and am now just shy of $200k at the age of 35. You read about the power of compound gains all the time, but to go from $100k to $200k in three years when the first $100k took seven years is a testiment to that fact.  My goal is $1 mil by 47 and eventually to hit $2.5 mil before I retire.   For all you youngins out there, stick with it! But also, don't rush the process and try to hit home runs every day. For the most part, I am a buy and hold investor after a year or two of trying my hand at day trading with options and futures. When you chase the money, you won't make it. But if you‚Äôre patient with a decent risk tolerance, anything is possible.     Edit: Wow, thanks for the up votes everyone. It‚Äôs been fun reading the comments. Adding some context here based on some of the questions that have come in. Monthly contributions are at $1,000 a month now, but in the early years they were less. When I first started, it was $100 a month and I worked my way up from there. There was a good chunk of time where they were between $200-$500 a month. These accounts were set up on my own, no employer match. I‚Äôm not sure what my lifetime performance is, but the last three years I‚Äôm up 30% overall. All that in mind, I can confidently say that well over half of my account is due to investment gains.   Investments have been all individual stocks that I typically hold for a year or longer. I pick them based on both technical and fundamental factors. This is more risky than ETFs and index funds but it suits my investing style and risk tolerance. I try to stick to profitable companies with a stock price that has a history of moving in the right direction, however I also like to buy at a discount price. I keep my eyes on charts and when there‚Äôs opportunities to buy at historically undervalued prices I jump on it. There‚Äôs really nothing super special to it. Not going to share my current exact portfolio, but stocks I have owned in the past or currently include AAPL, GOOGL, META, COST, HD, MCD, DKNG, AMD, DIS, and BAC to name a few. There are many others I‚Äôm interested in buying that are on my watchlist.  I will also add that I‚Äôve made a ton of mistakes along the way. Bad investments, selling too soon when I should of just held, taking risky, over leveraged day trades that resulted in nasty losses and wash sales. However, I‚Äôve learned from them and never done anything bad enough that blew an account or resulted in a draw down that couldn‚Äôt be recovered. You can read all the books you want but I‚Äôve always found that the best way is to learn by doing and over time you develop your own skills and are able to trust your own analysis and decisions.,;,; 2023-11-18 16:51:37]
[One common mistake of a novice trader,;,; Let's imagine the mindset of beginners. Beginners want to earn quickly, a lot and with minimal effort. And most likely, we know from our experience, they will be quite fearful. So they will choose those instruments that are well-known and have a good reputation. These will probably be stocks of companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple.  **How will beginners add companies to their portfolio?**   Let's specify that the stocks of these companies are not cheap and cost 100-300 dollars. Of course beginners want to fill their portfolio on enthusiasm right now. This means our trader will go to the stock exchange and simply buy them.   **What is wrong with that?**   The point is that you should buy shares of even the seemingly coolest and most famous companies not at any moment of time when you want to, but look at whether it is a good time to enter a position.   **What does good or bad timing mean?**   In investing for 10-15 years the concepts of good and bad time lose their relevance. Because for such a long period of time stocks can fall and rise 100 times.  But if we speak about from 1 to 6 months trading, it is very important to choose the right moment. Because you need to earn money rather quickly and you want to earn more, of course.   For the sake of simplicity let's consider 2 companies: META and AAPL.    Both of them have a beautiful growing chart for the last year of trading, but you should not buy both companies now, if you take them for a short term.   The fact is that META and AAPL stocks are at their all-time highs right now. They have rallied strongly over the past couple months and there will soon be a period when the price will be corrected. Since there is no one chart in the market that is a forever rising straight line. There will always come moments of correction. And if you buy their stocks now, you are very likely to buy at the most expensive price in recent times.   That's why it's important to learn how to analyze charts and choose the moments to buy or sell smartly.,;,; 2024-01-25 18:36:53]

I realize a lot don't sell due to taxes, but like I said, I don't have that worry so why should I hold and see my gains evaporate and then have no more significant cash to buy if we get some serious sales in February or March like I think we will?    I've been watching Mad Money and Cramer has been saying "you should take some gains cause the big money won't start buying mag 7 till they sell off more"  I think that's true.  I.made really good gains in nvda. I bought in at $144 a year and a half ago and I'm up to $490 a share, but it's been topping at $495 or so and then staying in range.  I've also been heavy msft aapl googl asml and lrcx and have very significant gains.  Don't see any reason that any stocks are going to go higher in the next few months till at least April if that.  Sure, maybe oil and utilities and industrials will go slightly higher but I think big money is waiting for the mag 7s to fall.  Anyone else going heavy cash right now?

[Talk me out of buying DIS,;,; Most of us if we had a time machine we would go back in time and buy AAPL, TSLA, NVDA. Well, I look at DIS ant notice it is trading at the same level as it was in 2014. So without the time machine, there is a chance to travel back 9 years and buy a blue chip stock?  I don't want to get into the politics of it. Quite candidly I'm conservative and support the FL laws. To me that is unrelated to the value here long term.  Reality is I just don't see DIS as a brand that is at any risk of liquidation or collapse; quite the opposite I see they could be primed for growth. They have their hands in several facets of the economy. Media, entertainment. They own some of the most iconic brands, if you want around the world and asked people to draw a picture of what they think of when they think of America, I bet either the mouse ears or McDonalds logo would be at the top.  Looking at the 2014 price, if the company has grown at just 6% a year that would put their stock price at $138 presently, so over 50% higher than the present value.  I think the end of the writers strike will help their stock, and I think a change in leadership will help their stock and I know Iger just came back on the scene and signed a new contract but at his age I could see the board making a change since their stock has continued to plunge upon his return.

Transactional volume still growing.   \- The drop in user count YoY might not be a direct effect of increased competition, but pandemic online shopping has died down.  \- FCF is strong, buybacks &amp; low forward PE.  \- Possible growth stories with Braintree, PayPal buy now pay later &amp; Venmo.  \- New CEO focused on improving profit margins.   \- High single digit growth  \-Decent network effects on both sides  &amp;#x200B;  Overall, I don't think it is the best company in the world, like MSFT, AAPL just to name a few.

[What are the benefits to simplifying your holdings?,;,; Hello! Roths are tax advantaged in that (myunderstandingatleast) there isn't any tax loss harvesting. So selling losses won't do anything so does one just leave it and hope for the best or get back what little money there is and buy something else?   Also, if there are only a small handful of shares of a small handful of stocks that have 800% return but only 1% dividends, wouldn't it be better to just sell for the gain and redistribute into a broad index ETF? For example 3 shares of HD, 5 of MSFT, 2 of KO, and 3 of AAPL into VOO or VTI or something? They made huge gains but pay little in dividends so DRIP is basically nonexistent.   Would it be best to let it all ride and just start a new DCA strategy or would a redistribute be a simpler better way? ,;,; 2023-12-18 23:16:54]

[Index fund vs top 10 S&amp;P Stocks?,;,; The first thing I did when I started my investment journey a while back was set up an S&amp;P500 index fund and invest monthly in it. I now know more about the stock market and trading/investing in general.   My question basically is would I be better off taking the accumulated funds from the fund and just allocating it into the top 10 stocks like AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA, NVDA etc? Is there any real benefit of using an index fund?  The only thing I can think of is I would probably be unable to use a Stock and Shares ISA (equivalent to a Roth IRA, I think) as my index fund uses GBP even though the fund tracks US stocks. To my understanding as soon as I make investments in USD I can no longer use the ISA. From the UK for context.  EDIT: Thank you all for your input.

[Offsetting Previous Losses While Continuing to Invest for the Future,;,; Hello, I am looking for some advice on smart investment strategies to offset my previous $100k loss against my recent capital gains for tax purposes.        In 2020 and 2021, I made some poor decisions by getting involved in risky options trading without fully understanding the downsides. Over time, I ended up losing around $100,000 from these trades (short-term). It was completely due to my own ignorance and mistakes. After 2021, I realized option trading was not appropriate for me, so I stopped all forms of trading to focus on my career. Over the next six months, I worked hard to improve my skillset for better career opportunities and landed a well-paying job with potential growth prospects. In early 2023, I invested $70k into NVDA, NFLX, GOOGL, and AAPL stocks. Fortunately, that $70,000 investment is now worth around $112k. I also received $17k worth of vested RSUs from my current employer which is now worth around $20k.        Additional Info:   * Married couple (36M, 32F) with a 3-year-old child, living in California (rented).  * Combined household income is \~$420k ($370k base salary + $50k RSUs).  * Retirement Savings: 401k - $300k; Taxable Investments - $120k; Vested RSUs - $20k + $55k (spouse)  * 529 College Savings Plan - $7k, contribute $3k per year.   Previous Capital Losses:   * In last 2 years, deducted $6k capital losses on tax returns.  * Have $94k remaining capital losses carried forward per 2022 tax filing.   Questions:   1. If I sell my NVDA, NFLX, GOOGL, AAPL shares with $42k ($112k-$70k) capital gains, the gains would be offset by my carried forward losses from previous years and I would not owe any taxes on it. The remaining $52k ($94k-$42k) losses could still be carried forward. Is this understanding, correct?  2. Does it make sense to realize the $42k short term capital gains to offset against losses, even though normally I'd owe taxes on short term gains?  3. Is it advisable to sell my vested RSUs, realizing $3k capital gains, to also offset against my carried forward capital losses? This would leave me with $49k ($52k-$3k) losses still.  4. Would the gains from my $300k Fidelity T-bills (maturing Mar/Apr 2024) also be eligible to offset against capital losses? If not, should I buy more T-bills after maturity? Context - I plan to use this for a house purchase downpayment in mid-2025.  5. For short term savings goals (1-1.5 years), are T-bills the optimal way to get guaranteed returns? Given my losses, are there better alternatives with comparable returns I should consider?  6. I'm unsure how investments like VUSXX, SGOV, BIL, USFR, TFLO compared to T-Bills in Fidelity. Could I purchase these instead for short term savings goals? Would these help recover my losses faster?  7. I know my losses carry forward each year deducting $3k in taxes until fully utilized. Without offsetting gains, it would take 31+ years at $3k/year ($94k/3k). If there is any advice on any other ways to recover these losses faster, kindly feel free to suggest.,;,; 2024-01-16 05:16:09]

[How to maximize Roth IRA contribution,;,; Hey everyone, I have a question regarding generating income to allow myself to contribute to my Roth IRA. For context I‚Äôm currently in graduate school and am no longer working. The past two years I‚Äôve worked and been able to max out my Roth contributions while not making enough to be taxed when filing. I currently have ~35000 dollars in a brokerage account. I have made 808 taxable dollars in dividends and that is my only income for the year. I would like to try and contribute more than that. So I was wondering if it is possible (legal?) to sell all of my current long term investments that are positive then reinvest them. If I did this I would net ~5200 as income bumping me up to around 6000 to contribute to my Roth. Am I allowed to just sell my current gains and repurchase their positions, or does that form a sort of wash for tax purposes? If not could I potentially pivot to different holdings?

[Mutual 'Fun' for my 3yo Son,;,; So for my son's first birthday (three years ago) I thought it would be fun to invest $1K and see where it would be when he turned 21. I asked all of his relatives to pick any stock or whatever, and then I bought fractional shares to spread out the $1K. I have a record of each initial stock purchase price (people picked everything from stuff that was hot then like NET, SPCE and PLTR to things they thought he'd identify with as he got older like DIS and NKE). Others played it safe and picked mutual funds. Anyway, the 'purity' of the initial $1K is gone because I've added more money (in small amounts) as people have given additional monetary birthday gifts etc. So now I have an imbalanced mishmash. I've been putting the 'new' money in safe places -- specifically VOO, SPY and BRKB. The total is still only about $2K but over the next 18 years I expect to continue to put modest amounts in and I am curious what people think. Should I hammer one mutual fund or spread it around?

[Is it recommended to buy stocks during a bear market and indexes during a bull market?,;,; When I first started out investing (Mid 2021), everything was really overvalued (imo. Didn't do much research). I ended up buying only low fee Total Market Indexes for the first year because I didn't feel like buying anything else. But ever since stocks started to fall en masse, I've been getting more and more tempted to buy individual stocks (GOOGL, MSFT, AAPL, DIS, META, AMZN) and haven't focused on buying ETFS. My portfolio went from 100% in one ETF to about 80% in it and the rest in stocks.   I have never sold a stock and only keep accumulating.

[Question about my LLC investing in the market short-term,;,; My LLC puts aside money from business income into a business savings account to pay taxes each year, and I have decided that rather than the funds sitting in a low-interest business savings account to invest in the market so that it earns a bit more on the capital. I've bought AAPL and MSFT, and I'm not worried that the share price will drop so much that I will lose money and not be able to pay my LLC taxes when they are due. My question is when I sell the shares next year to pay LLC taxes, if I only sell enough to recoup my original investment, and leave the profit earned in the market, am I off the hook for capital gains taxes or some other penalty? So, say I put $10k in the market, and it goes to $12k, and then in April I sell $10k worth to pay taxes and leave the 2K profit in the market long-term, what are the tax implications?

[Where to park my cash: I-bonds vs T bills vs CDs?,;,; I‚Äôm in my early 40s, sole breadwinner of a family of 4, no recurring debt other than my mortgage (30-yr, 2.8% interest), earn over $250k/yr.

My current portfolio value is below $300k, which is far less than it should be. I only became a high income earner in the past few years, so I got a late start to investing, and even more recent start to not market timing or gambling to ‚Äúmake up the difference‚Äù. Most of my investments now are broad index funds/ETFs, with some individual stocks leftover from my less Boglehead days. Half my stocks are in the green, half in the red. After seesawing up, down and up again, my whole portfolio is up around 2% total. Basically neutral since the start of the pandemic.  Back to the matter at hand, I bought $25k in I-bonds last year ($10k personal, $10k gift, $5k paper bonds from my tax refund). Even with expected drop in the 6-month rate starting in May, buying now would lock the current rate for the next 6 months. Averaged out over the next year, it would still appear to have a decent total return. Am I making a tactical error? Should I get a short term CD or T bill?

I feel like maybe my account lacks focus; do I dump stuff like target date funds and disciplined equity and just go FXAIX, FNXMC, JEPI?   I'm not trying to get crazy and beat the market; but I do realize I am lagging the market and want to get closer to market average returns; I do like JEPI for the dividend paying monthly in a tax advantaged account. ,;,; 2023-07-30 02:54:03]

[Consistently Solid Stocks,;,; I know that the most common (and usually best) advice for a casual investor is to just do a weekly purchase of S&amp;P 500 full index fund, like VOO or VTI etc.  And that's what I'm doing. Hands off.  But I was just wondering if you guys had any pocket picks for "consistently solid" stocks that you like to keep on their own?  I remember in high school doing a hypotheticals investment class and the winning group at the time just bought Coca-Cola and Wal-Mart stocks and outperformed the picks of every other group.  Something you would expect to grow at a decent enough pace for the foreseeable future (but not necessarily set the world on fire).  Edit: I'll also add - I'm not changing my investment strategy, I was just curious what other people like.,;,; 2024-02-15 16:52:28]

[Investing in corporate bonds,;,; Looking to learn more about fixed income markets and was wondering about some details. If anyone could answer sone of my questions, would greatly appreciate it!   1. AAPL Corp 2.4 May03‚Äô23. Current bid yield: 9.104%. Current ask yield: 4.794%. Closing price: 99.67  So this is a corporate bond for Apple, expiring 03/23 with a coupon rate of 2.4%, paid semi annually. How is there such a high yield when the price of the bond is almost at par value, and there is no risk of default?  What does the bid yield actually tell you, if not the expected return you‚Äôd make?  In a more general view of bonds, is it the current bid yield which determines the annual returns, assuming you hold till maturity?   Also, if you believe interest rates are going to go down, am I right in thinking bonds will rise in value? Is there a way of calculating how much they can/will rise in value or is it completely supply and demand   Thanks!,;,; 2023-04-22 21:52:25]

[My Willy-Nilly Stock Portfolio,;,; Hey, guess what! I'm beating the market YTD!  My make-believe portfolio is up 12.2% vs. 11.8% for VOO, a whopping 0.4% advantage.  The portfolio holds 38 company stocks. The thing is, I picked the stocks more or less at random ‚Äî just companies that I've heard of and "seemed" like they might do well going forward. No analysis, no research, no balance sheets or company reports, more like "selective dart throwing".  I think the returns are purely the product of luck and realize that my lead over VOO could evaporate at any time. We'll see. It kind of proves Peter Lynch's belief that any moax can beat the market but with a caveat: ***if you're lucky***.

[How to get rid of my trading habit to invest properly! Fear of losing the money!!,;,; I have built trading habit/mindset for many years due to lot of fear of losing the money, esp retirement account.  Over the past, I developed this habit of selling ETFs like QQQ/SMH and buying them back. This way, I secured my money (no loss) since 2021 December but a little gain appx 5% or less.  Even though I spot deep low good spot, I buy them some 10% or 20% of cash and sell them early to book profit, never had a guts to hold it.  Most of the times, I am missing the boat, continuous growth. I still feel bearish and trading then and there.  I recently tried bonds like TLT, but it went down from $98 to $95 range, sold it. I recently bought  APLY (thinking low volatility) around $19.5 but sold today by fear of losing money. When I buy, I think of hold long, but when I see nice jump or profit, my fear increases, selling it.  In my past, I bought TSLA at $41, NVDA at $55, FB at $50 and GOOGL $120. Had I kept those, I would have been multi millionaire by now, but sold everything with trading mindset.  Many of my friends told me, even close friend holding AAPL since 1998,  that trading not good, and try to make investing habits, but still my mind does not accept seeing huge negative on my account, say loss $10000.  I am mid 50s and naturally fear of losing money is common, but is trapped by trading mindset which I want to get rid of.  Read many books like Intelligent investor, Margin of safety etc and also reading many books, but that does not remove my fear of losing money.  I do not know whether I will be able to come out of not. If some one experienced like this and came out of that issue, please let me know how to get out of that.  Thanks in advance.  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-08-23 21:56:44]
[Best places to put profits after taking them?,;,; While it is ultimately up to each individual as to when to sell out of a position, my main hurdle against taking profits is that my money no longer continues growing. I‚Äôve put together a list of 5 assets where I can retire funds to so they can continually compound and retain value.  1. Real estate:  Pros:  inflation resistant, income potential, price appreciation, something I can control, depreciation. Marginable via helocs   Cons: would be active management, property taxes, large capital requirements, business risk  2. Cash (for right now)  Pros: risk free 5% rate, no thinking required   Cons: not always going to yield 5% and 5% only just now keeps up with inflation. Not as much capital appreciation potential.  3. Bonds   Pros: long term bonds can now provide capital appreciation due to rates poised to come down, high interest payment that can be locked in. Depending on the rate it can be kept up with inflation.   Cons: not always liquid, not always the best for capital appreciation, bond can default, taxes, not sure if marginable or if it‚Äôs even worth it   4. BRK.B/SPY  Pros: 10-15% a year on average forever, keeps up with inflation, capital appreciation, dividend from SPY, optionable, never under perform the market, marginable  Cons: market risk, business risk at Berkshire,  5. BTC  Pros: inflation resistant, cannot be censored or frozen by gov, lots of capital appreciation, ability to not have to pay taxes on it if I never sell   Cons: much more volatile, coin can always fail although it‚Äôs unlikely, personal risk of losing coins  These are the 5 places I‚Äôve come up with to retire funds in this current market. Im curious to see what others think and if I‚Äôm missing anything. My goal is to use profits from my investments to build out other investments which I know will be around for decades and will preserve capital whilst also growing it (albeit at a slower pace) and keeping up with inflation. Many investors can make a profit but fewer can keep it.,;,; 2023-11-20 12:37:08]
[Industries with Blue Chip Growth stocks that aren't tech ?,;,; My personal portfolio is heavily weighted on Tech. I have been risk averse, so most of it is in Blue Chip Tech companies who are well positioned to take advantage of the upcoming technological revolutions but also have solid revenue making product moats. (MSFT, AAPL). I also have a HUGE unvested position in the AI revolution. So no more money in AI for me.  As I look towards diversifying my portfolio, I am struggling to find any industry that also meets the following demands:  * Solid products that will make money today and 50 years from now * Sane P/E ratios (Keep it under 50 at least) * Poised to take advantage of one of the upcoming technological revolutions (ie. can expand their market) * Hard to beat Moat  The other industries that seem to have strong potential are the kind that have been losing money through the likes of Cathy Woods different ARK ETFs. All of Genomics, Drug Development, Space, 3D printing etc. are bleeding money by double digit percentages every year. Manufacturing companies are slowly revolutionizing, but I don't see their market expanding in a fashion that lets their stocks explode. Many others like mining &amp; energy seem to be so heavily regulated, that your investment is more a reflection of trust in the political class than the actual industry.   The compute hardware industry makes sense to me, but I am already invested in non-Nvidia players and it is too close to Tech anyway. Novo Nordisk satisfied all those requirements, and I was planning on investing in it in January. Dragged my feet with it, and the train has passed.  I can take risks. I am already maxing out my 401ks with safe index funds and I am 30 with my responsibilities paid off. But, don't say Crypto or weed-stocks. I have already been burned on both. I still maintain some crypto, but I am not changing my position on that. Either it all sinks or goes somewhere. Not an extra dollar in or out. Also, no Elon Musk companies please. Meme stocks aren't investments, it's gambling.  To me, genomics, drones (military) and surveillance are going to explode 10x at least in the next 10 years. I know founders in each of them, and have a strong intuition for the base technology. Not approaching it from a 'shiny new thing' perspective. But they are all so regulated and intertwined with Govts, that it is impossible to know who to put money on.,;,; 2023-09-29 15:07:21]
[Wanting to get rid of PMI and I have a few options,;,; Hi! I‚Äôm 26 yrs old living in South East Texas. I make $53560/yr. I max out my Roth IRA and my job puts away for retirement, as well. I have a nest egg that is roughly 4 months of living expenses. I also have a brokerage account with around $7000 in it, this is invested in primarily the S&amp;P500, AAPL, and a clean energy fund with smaller holdings in a sports gambling ETF and a space technology ETF  I currently own a home that I bought with a state grant. I used that grant to put down ~7% on a 200,000 home and have a 30 yr note with about a $1400 payment currently (that‚Äôs principal, interest, taxes, and insurance). My girlfriend of 6 yrs and I split this payment and all other expenses 50/50  My current goal is to get rid of my PMI. My current trajectory is no more PMI in May 2030. My PMI is $101 a month.  I have 3 things to consider to help me do that faster.   I am getting a 4% raise. I am considering taking that money (roughly $70/pay check or ~$2000/yr) and putting it towards the house. This would put me ahead by 24 months of payments. This would save me 2424 in the log run, not to mention the interest I‚Äôd save.  I have $7000 invested with no goal for it. I could pull that and put it towards the house. This would put me 22 months ahead of schedule, and I could invest the new money and rebuild just the same. Which would save me 2222 including the interest difference.  Finally, I could do both. Doing both would put me 40 months ahead of schedule. Which would save me 4,040, plus all the interest.  Is it worth doing this? Or should I just invest the $70/paycheck and let that continue to move?  Bonus question, what do you use your brokerage investments for? I‚Äôve never really had a goal for mine and the last time I sold was to pay off my car in late 2020.  Thanks for the input!

[How Nasdaq 100 ‚ÄòSpecial Rebalance‚Äô on July 24 will affect tech stocks,;,; On July 7 [Nasdaq announced]( its third-ever 'special rebalance' of the Nasdaq 100 index, which will take effect July 24, 2023.  As a result of the rebalance, you should expect Nasdaq to [significantly decrease the weight of the largest stocks]( ($MSFT, $AAPL, $GOOGL/$GOOG, $NVDA, and $AMZN) from a total of 43+% to below a 38.5% maximum. TSLA may also see a small downward weighting. Smaller stocks should see a small increase in the weight.  ETFs/mutual funds that try to follow the Nasdaq 100 (such as $QQQ) will need to adjust their holdings accordingly. So you should expect them to sell the largest stocks and buy the smaller ones -- perhaps they already have -- and that will affect the prices of those stocks accordingly.  It also means that those ETFs/mutual funds will not accurately reflect the relative weight of the largest stocks. So if you wish to be weighted according to actual market cap, you would need to supplement those holdings.  Normally the index rebalances every quarter. But the largest stocks are dominating the index and funds that follow the index need to maintain compliance with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule on fund diversification. On July 3, the largest six stocks saw their combined weight reach 50.9% of the index.

[Are we really in a bubble? Is a recession/bear market looming? 2021 business cycle compared to previous recessions,;,; [   [   [  Linked above is the SP 500 with markers notating peaks and recessions, in its 2001 dot com stock bubble, 2007 financial bubble and the 2021 stock bubble, which are necessary for understanding my reasoning.  Here's my take:   incoming 2nd recession: probable but not soon   bear market: over   stock market: about to take another run up/peak  2 important things of note:    1. While the yield curve inversions have predicted all of the previous recessions (including the brief but not shown covid recession from feb-april 2020) this does not actually line up with the peaks and troughs in the market as seen in my graphs   2. Recession happen in Bear markets (as per definition relying on negative GDP growth), but bear markets can happen without recessions as stock market =/= economy as a whole.  The 2001 bubble had its peak a just barely before the YC inversion.   The 2007 bubble had its peak a full year after YC inversion.   The 2020 brief 3 month recession was a result of covid lockdowns and therefore not applicable to our current situation.  So looking at our current market we should be aware that the December 2021 peak  and following 1 year bear market pull back is probably the sole result of covid tech stocks running up and not the long overdue bear market/recession everyone's been talking about incoming. Of course stock market =/= health of the economy. There are plenty of jobs and growth (both through pop growth and tech development) in the economy right now which is probably why the stock market looks as weird as it does right now.  See, with every previous bear market following a peak, the bear market lasts 2-3 years, but almost inexplicably we see a bear market through 2022 lasting less than a year, with the current run up being a positive indicator for the SP500.      My conclusion? We haven't actually seen the top of the market yet.   Because if we had, then the SP would have continued dropping for the next \~1.5 years, and just because the YC inverted doesnt mean we will IMMEDIATLY see the recession nor does it line up with the top of the market.    What we do have however is extremely positive growth signals (pop increasing/tech advances), a LOT more money in the market with the average investor in trading apps, more people returning to work, which will likely continue through the next few years. Of course anyone betting against the U.S. market is usually wrong as markets over time trend up logarithmically with bear markets sparse and lasting little more than 3 years. But that's the thing, it continues up LOGARYTHMICALLY and right now we are below that average line looking at the sp500 on a 20 year chart. Another run will happen beating 472 easy, likely followed by an actual bear market and recession, assuming the current YC inversion trends deeper, and doesn't immediately pop back up like it did in 2019, otherwise we may just not see the deep 2-3 year long bear market at all.

[Is a potential breakthrough in AI research/application going to be reflected in S&amp;P 500?,;,; With AI being the new hot topic out there, we see so many companies investing a lot of resources in R&amp;D hoping for a big breakthrough. While it is normal to see emerging companies being innovative and investors looking for opportunities, it can also be seen that companies such as MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL, AMZN are heavily invested into the idea, particularly MSFT with its continuous investment into OpenAI.  I don't see AI being an investment fad, for a lack of a better term, like it can be argued that blockchain, cryptocurrencies or NFTs were at some point. With that, I am mostly referring to ordinary investors that would invest in such assets on a long-term basis rather than traders looking for large returns with any of the financial instruments at their disposal.  Given the fact that the companies mentioned above already represent a fair share of the S&amp;P 500 index, is it safe to assume that any potential global breakthrough in AI is going to affect the value of any relevant ETFs since we do not know which of those major companies is going to be the first/best to reap the benefits of AI? Or the more risky approach of picking stocks like MSFT and emerging companies is more likely to be more profitable?  Some may argue that a breakthrough in AI R&amp;D is imminent but that it might actually result in a dot-com bubble-like crash because the current market prices have already factored in the expectation of larger returns which may or may not actually happen with AI.  In a nutshell, can S&amp;P 500 ETF investing reap the benefits of a potential AI revolution or investors still have to take the risk and pick individual stocks? Can a crash of S&amp;P 500 value be expected because some sectors could potentially lose value with AI or the prices are already too ambitious with some expectations on AI?,;,; 2023-05-12 04:59:05]
[Inflationary graph with no results,;,; I was just wondering the mechanism by which a stock like Domino's Pizza can zoom by over 3,000% over a decade and still only have a market cap of 11B. I was looking to see how they fare as an investment, given all the other struggling businesses, and if I had bought in 2010, it looks to have been a better investment than Apple, but the difference is that Domino's evaporates their money while Apple doesn't, even though the stock chart only shows more climbing. I have seen other charts like this, but this may be one of the more egregious examples.  My best theory is that they are reducing the amount of shares in circulation steadily over time to keep the price high. So I wonder a couple things: would an investor have actually made 3,000% during this time period, or would their holdings be continually adjusted to reflect the shares float? I guess I'm confusing that with split rules, but it doesn't make sense to make that much money on a business that's barely solvent. And my other question is, if someone had enough cash to short a high-priced stock like this today, would it be a good play given the fragility of the space and the way the stock has been manipulated? I would expect nothing but a quick catastrophe from such a bad business model.  I have a hard time gaining traction and support for my reddit threads when I make them, so I just want to clarify what was eyebrow-raising about the subject of this post. If the market cap is 11B, and they show growth of 3,300% over 13 years, then their capitalization must have been like $3.50, a couple of spare buttons and some pocket lint. Whatever they were doing to keep their graph looking nice while either losing or stagnating could not have helped the overall health of the stock. I think a symptom of the disease they gave themself is that despite a market cap of only 11B, the share price is over $300. I suppose they could split their shares, but it'd have to be like 20-to-1 to have their share price make sense for their market cap. Anyway I didn't mean anything bad by this post, I'm just probably not altogether coherent, but who really is? Who among you has all their ducks in a row, their head seated firmly upon their shoulders? I'm skeptical about the stability of my critics. I'd say they're all similarly flying by the seat of their pants as I am wont to do.,;,; 2023-07-03 13:33:41]
[Rebalancing portfolio for growth and being tax savvy - is this a good plan?,;,; My fiduciary is proposing rebalancing my portfolio which was inherited and currently focused on wealth maintenance rather than growth, but I‚Äôm not experienced and have no clue if what is being suggested makes sense. I‚Äôm 43 yr old, will have a pension upon retirement, have around $250,000 in high yield savings, my home is paid, no debt except for around 23k in student loans with low interest. Wife has around 160k in a 401k.  Main goals for this portfolio are retirement income and I would like to be tax smart:  -BrandywineGLOBAL Corporate Credit BCGIX MF 15% -Vanguard Total Bond Market BND ETF 15% -Vanguard Value VTV ETF 15% -Apple AAPL Stock 14% -Berkshire Hathaway BRKB Stock 10% -Vanguard Health Care VHT ETF 10% -Vanguard S&amp;P 500 VOO ETF 10% -Vanguard Total World Market VTV ETF 5% -Vanguard Utilities VPU ETF 5% -Fidelity Government Capital Reserves FZAXX MF 1%  While the portfolio allocation propsed above has historically generated near or above stock market level performance while taking significantly less risk (which is a good thing), one of my concerns for your account is to reposition the assets to a more tax-efficient allocation.  One of the ways to achieve this is in a taxable account using ETF‚Äôs for stock-oriented investments as opposed to mutual funds.  Mutual funds are required to pay out to shareholders and capital gain distributions from mutual funds which result in a taxable event.  Over the past two years your  account has generated taxable capital gain distributions of $8,000- $10,000 annually.  ETFs and individual stocks do not have to follow the same tax rules that apply to mutual funds, and therefore instead of paying out capital gain distributions to shareholders, they take the gains generated by the sale of stocks and just purchase more stocks.  Since the capital gain distribution is not paid out to you the result is avoidance of taxation.       The value of a couple stock oriented investments in your account have increased in value so if we were to sell the shares of those investments to rebalance  it would result in a capital gain of approximately $11,000¬± for 2023 taxes, but then going forward we no longer have those annual tax burdens.  Does the above sound ok? Or what should I be asking him?  I am trying to learn about investing instead of relying on Reddit but it‚Äôs a slow process so I appreciate this forum.  Thanks!,;,; 2023-08-05 19:55:18]
[Roth IRA vs Cash vs Margin Accounts,;,; &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  I'm trying to understand if my math (and logic) is correct when comparing gains on like-trades but in different account types. For reference, my investment amount will be $200,000 via TD Ameritrade/Charles Schwab, 15% tax rate, and 13.00% effective margin rate. 28 years old. Employed. Not married. No children.  &amp;#x200B;  AAPL 2023 YTD performance is \~+55.25%. Past performance is not indicative of future results, I know. According to 1stock1, between 1981 and 2022, Apple has been positive 27 of those 42 years, with the strongest being +211.90% and the weakest being +5.42%. The average of the positive years is +67.8103704%. Apple has been negative 15 of those 42 years, with the worst being -71.06% and the least being -4.17%. The average of the negative years is -29.092%. 1995 to 1997 (3 years) was Apple's longest consecutive yearly losing streak. 2009 to 2014 (6 years) was Apple's longest consecutive yearly gain streak. The average of all 42 years is +33.202381%.  &amp;#x200B;  Roth IRA contribution limit in 2024 is $7,000. Non-deductible. Tax-free at distribution in retirement. $7,000 + 30% = $9,100. Gain of $2,100  &amp;#x200B;  Cash account of $7,000 + 30% = $9,100. Gain of $2,100 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $1,785  &amp;#x200B;  I can see that in this example, the Roth IRA is the better choice as opposed to the cash account. However, the Roth IRA is limited to the $7,000 annual contribution. Any additional investing must be done in the cash account. As a result, the current optimal solution would be to contribute into the Roth IRA up to the limit and invest the remaining $193,000 in the cash account and continuing the annual contribution into the Roth IRA in following years.  &amp;#x200B;  Margin account of $7,000 + $7,000 (margin) = $14,000. $14,000 + 30% = $18,200. Gain of $4,200 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $3,570 - my cost of margin for 1 year which is (.13 \* 7000) = Gain of $3,570 - $910 (margin) = Gain of $2,660.  &amp;#x200B;  I can see that in this example, with the same $7,000, AFTER taxes AND cost of margin, the margin account is the better choice as opposed to both the cash account and the Roth IRA. Similar to the cash account, I have no annual contribution limit, can withdraw at any time, and can invest the full $200,000. With margin, this amount becomes $400,000. As a result, the current optimal solution appears to be investing the full amount of $200,000 + $200,000 in the margin account and disregarding the Roth IRA entirely.  &amp;#x200B;  While I take much greater risks investing that amount in a margin account and having the knowledge/information that the average of Apple's yearly losses is \~-30%, over the long term, it's clear on paper that the optimal strategy is to go full margin, with the honest hope that the first 2-3 years are positive. I also expect my current effective margin rate of 13.00% to decrease as rates go down. I also expect my income to increase at a reasonable pace. I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning or not but I would like to marry and have children in the future.  &amp;#x200B;  Again, is my math (and logic) correct? Am I completely overlooking something?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks!!  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-12-22 17:56:12]
[Empower vs. Fidelity Recommendation - advice on specific situation,;,; Hi,    My fianc√© (35) is considering transferring the majority of her retirement funds from Fidelity to Empower.    Empower is her current employer 401K.  There is around $9K in that account.    Currently she has a rollover IRA (rolled over last year from a prior employer) as well as a Roth IRA  with Fidelity.  Here is the breakdown of those accounts  -    Rollover IRA ‚Äì    79,839.18 in cash    AAPL ‚Äì 1 @ Cost basis of 146.93    FARMX ‚Äì 156.88 @ avg cost basis of 18.33    FBGRX ‚Äì 10.572 @ avg cost basis of 177.36    FITLX ‚Äì 68.726 @ avg cost basis of 20.01    FMEIX ‚Äì 85.307 @ avg cost basis of 17.29    FPURX ‚Äì 58.806 @ avg cost basis of 23.38    FSKAX ‚Äì 0.662 @ avg cost basis of 113.29    FVAL ‚Äì 66.666 @ avg cost basis of 47.89    FXAIX ‚Äì 13.102 @ avg cost basis of 154.56    FXNAX ‚Äì 21.06 @ avg cost basis of 10.68    FZILX ‚Äì 161.578 @ avg cost basis of 11.53    FZROX ‚Äì 117.833 @ avg cost basis of 15.91    GOOGL ‚Äì 20 @ avg cost basis of 14.08    MSFT ‚Äì 2 @ avg cost basis of 288.18     SCHD ‚Äì 13.926 @ avg cost basis of 78.57        Roth IRA ‚Äì  3,932.68 in total investments spread across companies like META, NVDA, WYNN, RRR, ASO, AMD, DIS, etc. Down about $145 all time.    A random $800 from an older 401K that needs to be rolled over.    The main question she is wondering if she should roll both Fidelity accounts into the Empower My Total Retirement program.  She had a meeting with them and they said that if she did there would be no advisory fee.  The plan documents for their 401K say there is a quarterly fee of 0.1125%.  The Premier Retirement Advisory services has a fee of 0.50%/year plus another 0.4% for the next 150K.She is looking for some input on a few questions ‚Äì     1)	Is the my total retirement annual the same as the advisory fee they said they would waive?     2)	Is there a transaction fee to buy/sell even if the advisory is managing the transactions?  There seems to be charges for each transaction in her 401K and she is currently signed up for the My Total Retirement Program.    3)	I think she would need to liquidate the Fidelity zero funds if she moved to Empower and that would be a taxable event.  Is that accurate?    4)	Most importantly, would it be worth it to move the Fidelity funds to Empower and have them manage it?  And if it is not worth it, should she stop the My Total Retirement program at Empower to save on fees and just keep running the self directed 401K?    My idea with recommending the Fidelity funds to her initially was the zero expense ratio for some of the funds above.      TIA for any advice.,;,; 2023-05-14 20:00:34]
[Avantis AVGE Holdings Data/Study,;,; I'm developing an application related to ETF portfolios (the goal is to be able to analyze intersection, diversification between countries, categories, portfolio trend \[small to large, value to growth map\], etc).  Anyway. An ETF that I really like is **AVGE**, from Avantis. If I could summarize it in a few words, it would be the "VT with tendency to the value factor". It is a "fund of funds" with the following composition:  * Avantis U.S. Equity ETF (42.78%) * Avantis U.S. Large Cap Value ETF (15.05%) * Avantis International Equity ETF (10.89%) * Avantis Emerging Markets Equity ETF (6.37%) * Avantis International Large Cap Value ETF (5.49%) * Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (4.95%) * Avantis U.S Small Cap Equity ETF (4.86%) * Avantis Emerging Markets Value ETF (4.28%) * Avantis Real Estate ETF (3.00%) * Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF (2.17%) * State Street Institutional Investment Trust US Government Money Market Fund Institutional (0.09%)  I got this information from the website [etf.com/avge]( But I would like to go further. I would not like to see the funds that make up these funds, I want to see the holdings that make up the funds of that fund.  So, with a little bit of programming I was able to extract this information and publish it in this github repository. There are two CSV, of which:  * [avge-holdings-ungrouped.csv]( In this CSV I have not grouped the repeated companies. You will be able to see the weight of each holding in each of the funds. Example: APPL represents 4.78% of AVUS (which represents 42.78% of AVGE) and at the same time represents 2.98% of AVLV (which represents 15.05% of AVGE). * [avge-holdings-grouped.csv]( This CSV shows the actual participation of a given company in AVGE. So, for example, the APPL that is part of AVUS and AVLG, its real weight is 2.49% (4.78%\*42.78% + 2.98%\*15.05%).  And, just to make the post more graphic, I end with the list of the 10 biggest AVGE positions.  |Name|Ticker|Weight| |:-|:-|:-| |Apple Inc.|AAPL|2.49%| |Microsoft Corporation|MSFT|1.56%| |Exxon Mobil Corporation|XOM|0.92%| |Meta Platforms Inc. Class A|META|0.85%| |JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co|JPM|0.80%| |Chevron Corporation|CVX|0.77%| |Merck &amp; Co., Inc|MRK|0.76%| |Alphabet Inc. Class A|GOOGL|0.63%| |Pfizer Inc|PFE|0.56%| |Alphabet Inc. Class C|GOOG|0.55%|  The fund's 10 largest positions add up to **9.91%**. It's a pretty small value when compared to growth ETFs like QQQ, VUG, etc.  # Next goals (which I will do when I have time):  * Compare the percentage portfolio between AVGE and VT; * Get the country and sector of each of the 9824 holdings. In this way I will be able to carry out a study of the geographic and sectorial diversification of AVGE. I'll probably use ChatGPT to help me with this because I haven't found any api that can give me this information easily.,;,; 2023-04-20 19:01:28]
[Stock selling / portfolio restructure advice,;,; Hello all,  (TL;DR - income down and uncertain in the short term, big home improvement project coming up, way more money in stocks than savings. Need to tap into equities but unsure which ones would be best. Also seeking restructure/optimization advice on portfolio.)  Recent dip in income, trying to change careers, housing projects coming due - running into a situation where I think it would be more beneficial to liquidate shares and park in a high yield savings acct for less volatility with all the uncertainty in my short term future. Would love advice on which stocks/ETFs y'all think I should sell off or just general advice on my situation.   Assets: currently ~$7k in checking/savings with upcoming deposit of $14k landing in the next few weeks. Bank offers 2% APY and I know I can get better returns elsewhere, just haven't really bothered as I keep most of my "long-term" money in stocks.  Income: TBD. Mortgage loan officer and times are tough. Followed a college to a new job with promises of greener grass but it isn't looking good. Pursuing career change for more stability. May take a few months+ for earnings to align with my target again. Wife works salary job @ $90k/yr.  Expenses: $2k/mo for my half of mtg + utilities + personal loan, $150 car payment. Round everything up and I'm probably $3k - $3,500/mo depending on how much fun I want to have on him weekends.   Sitting on a $20k loan for the home project that I'm splitting payments on with the wife. Estimating another ~$10k+ on top for total project completion that will most likely come out of my pocket. Rate is 13.49%. Once the dust settles on the project plan is to pay it off aggressively depending on income. Got the loan as wife doesn't have full cash on hand and I'd rather have a slow trickle from my account rater than large lump sum payout.   Got Robinhood in 2020 and quickly realized I have no idea what I'm really doing. Most of my money  is in ETFs but I think there's a fair amount of redundancy in my holdings and I'd probably benefit from consolidating. Some accounts are positive, some negative. Had to pay taxes last year but don't really anticipate that being the case for 2023.  Holdings:  -VOO Equity: $6,109 Total return: +$1,677  -DAL Equity: $987 Total return: +$403  -C Equity: $468 Total return: -$97  -WKHS Equity: $7.59 Total return: -$179  -ARKK (I know, I know) Equity: $312 Total return: -$375  -NDAQ Equity: $1,445 Total return: -$68  -AAPL Equity: $577 Total return: +$176  -TAN Equity: $875 Total return: -$117  -QQQ Equity: $3,856 Total return: +$739  -MSFT Equity: $1,015 Total return: +$396  -VGT Equity: $2,344 Total return: +478  -ICLN Equity: $1,808 Total return: -$398  -VTI Equity: $5,742 Total return: +$7  -VNQ Equity: $2,520 Total return: -$526  -VTV Equity: $3,341 Total Return: -$49  -MGK Equity: $1,114 Total Return: -$41  -SCHD Equity: $3,569 Total Return: -$12  -Acorns Account (moderately aggressive) Equity: $26,464 Total Return: +$1,620  I'm 28 so retirement is a far off horizon. Already maxing IRA and 401k so I consider my stocks to be more of a "reserve" account, ideally for long term growth but also access to additional funds if needed. Biggest fear I guess would be income stays low for a while while I figure things out, market tanks, now I'm selling stocks for pennies on the dollar to get by.  My thoughts/plan:  Sell off DAL, C, NDAQ, TAN, ICLN, &amp; SCHD for a total of $9,153 and net loss of $289. This should cover most of the additional housing expenses and minimize losses.  But what would you do from there, especially if I'm anticipating a big reduction in income for the next 6 months?  Been considering selling everything besides (V)ETFs and then shaving off additional equity as needed but idk if that would be most prudent.   Thanks in advance. Didn't mean for this to turn into a text wall.,;,; 2023-09-04 20:35:20]

[Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,;,; From [Investopedia](  "Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.  KEY TAKEAWAYS Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.  The company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.  Previously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.  The move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.  Apple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release.   The company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.  The company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.   The new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).   Apple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.   So far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.  Apple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year.   In each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.  Apple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed."  Personally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.,;,; 2023-03-28 09:43:30]

[What is the justification of stocks like Apple and others current valuation?,;,; Going in to 2024 I feel in my gut that the big stocks are simply overvalued and due for a correction. And it‚Äôs become that so goes Apple, so goes a lot of the funds we‚Äôre all in. And this is not a knock on Apple, I‚Äôd love to own Apple stock but it gained a trillion in market cap with no corresponding change in growth over the year.   Simply put, it just seems that the market must be expecting further currency devaluation, that we will soon be talking about most stocks in the trillions, or we‚Äôre walking on a tightrope going into 2024.,;,; 2024-01-02 03:46:07]
[Apple iPhone sales drop more than forecast, revenue falls for third straight quarter - Yahoo Finance,;,; [   Apple (AAPL) announced its fiscal Q3 earnings after the bell on Thursday, reporting iPhone sales that missed analysts' expectations while **revenue fell 1.4% over last year, the third straight quarter of declines.** About half of the company's overall revenue comes from its iPhone segment.        On Friday, Apple stock was down 2% in premarket trading, as the tech giants gloomy results contributed to it's share price decline.        Revenue has slid for multiple quarters at the tech giant as Mac and iPad sales have flagged. On a call with analysts Apple CFO Luca Maestri said **the company expects revenue for these products to fall by double digits from last year**, citing pent-up demand from the prior year quarter after factory shutdowns.        Services did better however my big question is if this really can compensate if Apple's hardware sales keep slumping? Quite frankly i don't understand why people keep buying the same iphone every year or maybe they no longer do? It's time Apple steps up its iphone and other hardware innovation instead of just repackaging the same thing every year with minor-to-no updates.  PS. anybody else would wanna see a macbook (pro) **with touchscreen**? Personally i love my Dell XPS 13 4K with touchscreen and love the dimensions are only 30x20cm.

[General Advice Sought. A friend/family member acting as a wealth advisor of 10-15 years is refusing to make an apples-to-apples comparison to Vanguard funds.,;,; (Apologies if this is the wrong forum)   A friend has been with a wealth advisor (family/friend) for the last 10-15 years. The friend has asked many questions along the way but has always been counseled to stay cool and stick with the advisor. The wealth advisor is claiming a 6.76% return since 2012 (after fees) but refuses to address whether/why Vanguard funds seem to have a better track record. Instead, the wealth advisor continues to compare it's returns to that of a set of investments chosen by the wealth advisor as an alternative proving an above-market performance (i.e., in a seemingly straw man argument). Meanwhile, Vanguard funds seem to be way above this 6.76% return.   The friend is not looking to become rich and famous here. Rather, a rational investment in hopes of a reasonable retirement is all that is sought. That is, what is sought is an apples-to-apples comparison of the returns that have been shown (6.76%) are comparable with returns that might be had from other widely available funds/indexes like those from Vanguard.

This makes them ‚Äúthe two most China exposed companies,‚Äù of the Magnificent Seven.   &gt; Apple recently cut handset prices in the China where it battles competitors like Huawei.

[Need help unloading Apple,;,; Hi all,   Sorry in advance on formatting, I‚Äôm writing this on my phone.   My wife (28F) and I (35M) are going to be diversifying from apple and would love your opinions. I will give a brief background about us and also our financial situation.   My wife is finishing her masters program in the spring of 24 and will be making about 100k a year. She will have about 70k in student debt. I am in tech and earn about 175-250k with zero debt. We have 1 daughter who is 3 years old. We live in a HCOL area in Northern California and fortunately have a paid off residence.   The allocations below are held in a trust which took a 90k loss last year and gives us the opportunity to reduce allocation % in apple. Essentially we will be selling 90,000 in capital gains (roughly 690+ shares) and diversifying.   (Trust) Apple shares - 3,250 ($572,975) Shwab CD - $125,000 (4.1% &amp; expiring in October 2023)  Cash - 14.5k  Personal brokerage  Apple shares - 620 ($109,306) Nvidia shares - 15 ($6,720 Tesla - 10 ($2,670) 529 account - ($4,000) VTI - $22,420 (Roth ira) 401k - $101,000 (VTSAX) Cash - 35k  Our Schwab advisor is pushing for a self directed index through Schwab. The Schwab advisor  wants us to harvest losses in the future so we can diversify apple to even out the allocations. Minimum investment amount is 100k into this self directed index fund. Our longLong term goal is wanting to have a 10-15% allocation in apple.   My question to the group is, what should my next step be? I‚Äôm a little skeptical about a self directed index fund because it‚Äôs a Schwab robo advisor with .4% fees. Should i just sell 75% of the entire trust and VTI or VOO it? We are very fortunate to be in this situation but are losing sleep at night with everything in 1 stock.   Thank you in advance!,;,; 2023-09-18 20:52:56]
[Analysis of an Analyst Raising Apple target to $190,;,; Full Article: [  Essentially in his forecast driven by high iPhone demand in china and steady sales in January through February, Market Analyst Dan Ives reiterated the outperform rating he‚Äôs had on Apple for at least the past three years. He raised his stock-price target to $190 from $180, with the new target implying about 25% upside from current levels. Why so optimistic? Is that realistic? And if so over what time frame are we talking here?  My analysis is mainly being drawn from [this data here]( (great resource for well compiled company data) as well as my knowledge of the company and other articles I've perused during this endeavor.  The synopsis forecast on the stock report card linked is: "41 analysts offer 12-month price forecasts for AAPL. Together, they have an average target of 179.88, the most optimistic forecast put AAPL at 210 within 12-months and the most pessimistic has AAPL at 140."  Their recent low came at the end of December after [pretty bad holiday sales]( but those seem to mainly have been do to continued production disruption rather than low demand. This was also the only quarter in the last 20 in which they have missed earnings. So I would argue these are strong indicators that we won't be seeing it drop to 140.  Apple is also diversifying its supply chain so over time and without another pandemic, those disruptions should become less frequent and impactful.  Like I mentioned before, this isn't the only article I've seen recently where analysts are targeting Apple for the $190 to $210 range and I think if there is any solid movement on the rumored AR headset or (much less likely) the Apple Car, we could easily see a rally over the next year or two, to the proposed prices.  Last year apple hit a high of $179 so it wasn't far off from this target. Even with all the tech layoffs and seeming bubble bursting of that sector, Apple hasn't had. mass layoffs and is still increasing its historic and investor friendly [stock buyback program](  Most of the company's prospects are good and they get a solid B rating in the report card above, but they have been very volatile over the last year (volatility grade of C) going from a one year high of 179 and a low of around 125.  I definitely think they as a company can reach those targets, but I wonder if they can reach them in the proposed 12 month time frame given current market conditions. Tech is being rocked, interest rates are going to keep going up for a while now, inflation has been hurting consumers and I wonder if demand for big ticket items like iPhones/macs will continue even if they don't raise prices (which I don't think they will or need to). If anyone can weather the storm of pending recession its Apple, but will they continue to be a beacon of growth during this time and reach these targets despite the rest of the market or are they going to trade sideways for a while and only break out when the rest of the market also starts to rally? What do you think? Especially curious to hear from others who have a solid amount of Apple in their portfolio?,;,; 2023-03-08 23:20:19]

[Rates are not high and the market is not crashing especially when Apple is still near ATH and not $120.,;,; 5-10% interest rates are normal historically speaking. The last 15 years have been an outlier. And despite high housing prices, people can obviously afford it and are buying, some with cash. Sure many Americans may be poorer but there are a lot more Americans with higher paying jobs and cash, especially in the cities and suburbs on the coasts.   Apples stock price has barely dropped and still trades at a healthy $170 range. Apple and Microsoft make up the largest allocations of Spy and many many funds. People crying now are being ridiculous. The real pain won‚Äôt start until Apple is at least down in the $150 range and things will be in full swing around $120 range. Same thing goes when Microsoft is under $230.   When these two things happen, I think spy will drop to around $330-340 range. That will be the time to jump in with everything you have. I‚Äôll be buying TLT also then hopefully around $45.   You might get a temporary drop if the government defaults, remains shutdown longer than a month and congress gets held hostage by like 5 house representatives or if JPow grows a pair and hikes 200 points.

[In-Depth Analysis: Apple's AAPL Stock Performance and Underperformance in the AI Race,;,; I've been studying Apple's recent financial performance and found some points of concern. Despite their significant revenue, they have seen a decline in gross margin percentage, from 38.2% in 2017 to 37.6% in 2020. This could be indicative of increased production costs or decreased pricing power.   Furthermore, they have been spending heavily on share buybacks, with a total of $73.2 billion in 2020 alone. While this may boost earnings per share in the short term, it's also indicative of a potential lack of more productive investment opportunities.   In addition, while Apple's been investing in AI, they seem to be lagging behind competitors like Google and OpenAI. While they have made some acquisitions in the space, they have yet to make significant strides, which raises concerns about their ability to keep pace in this rapidly evolving field.   I believe it's important for us as investors to critically assess these companies, especially ones as influential as Apple.,;,; 2023-05-24 18:39:59]

[Which AR company is the ideal investment?,;,; I'll just say first off, I don't think AR is the big investment right now. AI is clearly here now, and AR is maybe 5 years out before some VERY heavy investment. Right now the leaders are Meta and Apple.   Opinions:   Meta Case: Meta's headset makes you look like a cyborg, its very goofy looking compared to the Apple Vision Pro. It's also angled at gaming, which is problematic because none of the major gaming companies have committed to it, meaning until that occurs there is no guarantee that the gaming angle plays out. I imagine programming a VR game is SIGNIFICANTLY more intensive of an investment than required for an xbox game. That said META is not cannibalizing its own sales nearly as much as Apple...  &amp;#x200B;  Apple Case: The vision pro looks much cleaner, as do almost all Apple products. Apple has the wearable tech that will help them make the headset much smaller over time. They are also angled towards business. I just watched the Vision Pro video and frankly it looks like a great product for three reasons: The clean look, the dimming of a room when watching TV/movies which enhances the experience and makes it more convenient. Finally, I think the environment one is very good. I can be doing my work on the vision pro "literally" surrounded by Mount Doom's lava and Frodo bringing the ring up to the mountain. The massive con is that the vision pro cannibalizes the iphone and the mac book. As the vision pro gains traction there is immediately less of an incentive for using the iphone and the mac book which make up a big piece of apple's sales.  &amp;#x200B;  What are your thoughts? Right now, my money is in Meta, but after seeing Apple's product I think apple has gone the right direction. Meta is too reliant on the gaming industry and they haven't made it nearly as suitable for wearing it in social situations. No way you're wearing that headset around other people at a party.,;,; 2024-01-20 14:36:41]

VGT is 50% Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia.   If you make up a portfolio of Apple+Microsoft+nvidia, you will see a matching correlation again with VGT and QQQM only an even higher performance than VGT.

[A Deep Dive on PayPal: Is it a good time to Buy? [DD],;,; A couple of years ago, PayPal was all the hype. Today, the stock is down 75% from its all-time high. Once a growth stock, PayPal is now moving towards value stock territory. The big question here is this. Is PayPal worth buying right now? Is it a bargain or is it a value trap?  # Operations  First of all, let's look at PayPal's operations. PayPal's main source of revenue are the fees that PayPal charges for completing transactions and other payment-related services. Other revenue sources include foreign currency conversion fees and also fees for purchasing or selling cryptocurrencies. As such, PayPal's business model is based on the volume of transactions. The more transactions, the more fees the company gets. In 2022, users, transactions and payment volume on PayPal increased.  * 2% increase in users to 435 million with 8.6 million new net accounts addedOut of these, 400 million were consumer active accounts and 35 million were active merchant accounts * 16% increase in number of transactions to 22.3 billion * 9% total payment volume increase to $1.36 trillion on a spot basis so basically without adjusting for any forex changes.  The family of PayPal brands includes Braintree, Chargehound, Honey, Venmo and others so the company has a very strong brand presence. I keep seeing an ad for Honey almost every single day, I think the other brands are more US-focused (I'm UK-based), but the gist of it is that PayPal is becoming more popular, more established. [Recently, PayPal added more features to its payment solutions for small businesses.]( The main change was increasing the range of payment options for customers by including Apple Pay along with saving payment options and others.  # Competition  When it comes to mobile payments, PayPal competes with the likes of Google Pay, Cash App, Zelle, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Venmo although Venmo is actually owned by PayPal. They all have some pros and cons. However, PayPal appears to have the best international payment support. PayPal owns Xoom which allows users to send payments to users in 131 countries without the recipient needing an app or a smartphone. The recipient can just pick up the payment at their local bank. PayPal also allows you to send money to people in over 200 countries worldwide as long as they also have the app. PayPal is also ahead of the competition when it comes to web and website payments since you can complete the payment by using any web browser. Doesn't matter if it's Firefox, Chrome or Safari. However, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay can be used with smart watches which are becoming more and more popular.  ***US market***   In fact, this may be one of the reasons why Apple Pay is the most widely used mobile payment service in the US. 43.9 million people report using it at least once followed by Starbucks with 31.2 million. Yes, Starbucks, I know, I'm surprised as well, but it seems to be a popular method of payment in the US. Google Pay follows with 25 million users and Samsung Pay with 16.3 million users. Again, this is in the US.  ***Worldwide***   In terms of total mobile payment users worldwide, you have AliPay and WeChat Pay with 650 and 500 million users respectively, followed by Apple Pay with 507 million, Google Pay with 421 million and PayPal with 377 million. Venmo has 52 million, but it counted separately. If you combine the two since Paypal owns Venmo, Paypal comes ahead of Google Pay with 429 million users. Plus, AliPay and WeChat Pay are pretty much the status quo in China, but they are not that big outside of China. In fact, I'm not sure you can get them outside of China unless you are a Chinese national. Essentially, Google Pay, Apple Pay and Paypal are the big international names. Now, Google and Apple have a big advantage because they obviously produce their own phones, they have iOS and Android and they pretty much come with built-in Apple and Google Pay. They also have the smart watches which integrate with these payment apps.  ***Total Payment Volume competition***   Now, it would be really good if we could see the official total payment volume through these apps and compare it with Paypal. It could be the case where because the payment apps are installed by default, it seems they have a large userbase, but in reality users don't use them as much as Paypal or they just use them for small purchases. [The closest stats I could find were in this article here]( The author claims that Apple Pay has a total transaction volume of $6 trillion whereas Google Pay had $2.5 trillion. However, these are not official statistics by either of these companies. There are also disagreements over what exactly constitutes an Apple Pay or Google Pay transaction. In most cases, people don't pay with the apps, they just use the wallet option to pay with their actual card instead of paying with the digital payment app. Again, we don't know the exact transaction volume and we can just speculate, but we can see why Apple and Google Pay are massive competitors to Paypal. Still, the good thing is that the market for mobile payment apps is growing fast worldwide. There are a lot more users left to capture and Paypal is in a good position to do that as one of the leading payment apps, but enough about operations.  # Financials metrics  We know Paypal is big and we know it's not going anywhere. The company is a viable competitor to Google and Apple, but what are the financials of Paypal? Are they profitable? Are they efficient? What's the case here?  To answer these questions, I will look at Paypal's current and historical metrics and compare them to the company's peers in the Transaction and Payment Processing sector in the US. Quick note on the sector metrics. This sector is dominated by Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Fiserv, Block and Fidelity National Information Services. These 6 companies make up 77% of the total revenue in this sector. Meanwhile, 18 of the 35 companies in the sector are losing money. Basically, take the sector data with some hint of salt. I want to provide some comparison for Paypal, but at the same time we have a duopoly of Visa and Mastercard at the top and a lot of new players at the bottom.  Okay, so lets look at profitability. Paypal has a:  * gross profit margin of 42.35% which is below its 5-year average of 45.79% and the sector median of 47.32% * net income margin of 8.79% is also below its 5-year average of 14.58%, but above the sector median of 0.57% * levered free cash flow margin stands at 12.1% compared to its 5-year average of 14.58% and the sector median of 4.73% * Return on Equity is decent at 11.5% compared to the 5-year average of 16.7% and the sector median of 11.05%  Overall, Paypal is doing well. Their metrics have declined over the last few years which is worrying, but the change has not been that drastic \[yet\]. It's good to monitor these metrics of course because this could turn into a red flag if the trend continues.  # Analyst Expectations  Despite the above, analysts are expecting a steady growth in earnings per share over the next few years. The consensus is:  * 18.33% in 2023 * 15.28% in 2024 * 13.07% in 2025  In fact, analysts have recently started revising their expectations up which is a good sign. Basically, the sentiment towards Paypal is improving after a year and a half of declining expectations. This type of expectations change often leads to a reversal in stock price so this is one reason why I am turning bullish on Paypal.  Paypal has historically shown really good growth in revenue and earnings. Their compounded annual revenue growth is 17% since 2013 with their revenue going from $6,727 billion in 2013 to $27,518 billion in 2022. Their compounded annual earnings growth is 10.9% with earnings growing from $955 million in 2013 to $2.42 billion in 2022. By the looks of it, this type of growth can be sustained for at least another few years.  # Valuation  This is really, really good, mainly because the stock has lately been priced as a value stock. Paypal has:  * adjusted PE ratio of 18.15 compared to the 5-year average of 41.72. * adjusted forward PE ratio of 15.34 compared to the 5-year average of 37.94 * price-to-earnings growth ratio of only 1.1 compared to the 5-year average of 2 * relatively low forward price-to-book of 3.74 compared to the 5-year average of 8.1 * forward price-to-cash-flow of 11.84 compared to their 5-year average of 27.4  The way I see it, there are 2 reasons for the low valuation.  One, Paypal had a massively inflated stock price in 2021. Typically, you see a corresponding massive drop in price after this type of jump in valuation. Overreaction in one direction leads to overreaction in the opposite direction, a bit like a pendulum. This creates an amazing buying opportunity and I think we are seeing this right now.  The second reason for the low valuation could be that investors have different expectations to analysts. Even though the analysts expect a steady growth in earnings and profits, maybe investors don't see it that that way. Maybe there are some risk factors that analysts are overlooking. That's valid. Looking at Paypal's annual report, we can see a lot of factors that the company identifies. Cybersecurity is a crucial one, increasing competition is another. You also have legislation and compliance risk, you have risk to do with credit, third parties and so on. A lot of these are just regular day-to-day business threats that a financial processing company faces.  The main risk in my eyes is the increasing competition from Google and Apple. However, Paypal has some advantage there because it is mainly a financial company. Google and Apple have other more important business units and I think that Google Pay and Apple Pay are not as important to these companies as their core businesses. In comparison, payments and transactions are Paypal's core business. Cryptocurrency is also a growing risk, but I don't think it poses that big of a threat to Paypal right now. Maybe in 5 years or so. However, Paypal has been active in allowing users to buy, sell and transfer cryptocurrencies. Plus, users can actually use Paypal to pay in crypto although there are improvements that can be made there.  # Conclusion  Overall, I think that **we currently have a good bullish argument for Paypal**. The valuation is really cheap. We are seeing some of the lowest prices since December 2018. Even the company itself has committed to buying back a lot of shares because of the cheap price. In 2022, Paypal bought back $4.2 billion worth of shares or about 80% of their free cash flow. The management has said that they think share buybacks are an excellent way to spend their capital and I agree. They estimate that 75% of the free cash flow in 2023 will go towards share repurchases. In my opinion, this will create bullish pressure for the company. It will reduce the floating stock, it will increase ownership for existing shareholders and it will boost metrics. In terms of target price, the analyst consensus right now is $103.4 dollars or about a 38% upside on the current price of $75. I think that's a reasonable target for the next 12 to 18 months.  What do you think? Is Paypal a good purchase right now? Have I missed any important details about their business?,;,; 2023-04-10 10:43:50]
[Beating on the next AAPL/MSFT,;,; I‚Äôve been thinking about gambling on new AI companies that are just starting out with lots of risk and huge potential upside.   Apple‚Äôs all time gain is roughly 167,000%; Microsoft‚Äôs is roughly 406,000%.  According to a quick Wikipedia search, roughly 135 computer companies were founded between 1975 and 1980. This includes AAPL and MSFT. 2/135 is roughly 1.5%.  Let‚Äôs say I took $1000 and divided it among 100 companies just starting out in AI at $10 each. Then I hold for 40 years and watch most go bankrupt. If 1 of them is the next Apple then $10 turns into $1.7mil.  Convince me not to!  Note: This post is just theoretical. I thought it would be an interesting discussion topic. I mostly value invest or buy VOO.,;,; 2024-02-16 06:20:22]
[Blackrock Vs Vanguard investment funds. Who owns the underlying companies. ,;,; I just learned this myself, a bit embarrassingly late, that vanguard is owned by it's investors. So in that case, if I invested in a vanguard fund, then I should also be the partial owner in the company in relation to my percentage ownership of the fund? Eg, if the fund owns 100 shares of apple, and I own 1 percent of the fund, then I own 1 share of apple. Of course in reality the ownership stake would be negligible.   Is this actually true? And do we not get voting rights in each underlying company due to just how many there are and how insane it would be to tally every single investors vote for every single company, in say the SP500. Or is it because we only own a partial stake in vanguard and it means nothing for the underlying companies they invest in? If someone had a larger, majority stake in a vanguard fund, would they have voting rights, or am I missing something?  Next question is about BlackRock. It's a public company. So if I invest in a BlackRock fund, who is the owner partially, of the underlying companies? Is it me indirectly through my stake in the fund, while the shareholders in BlackRock profit from the money BlackRock earns through charging me fees. Or is it the shareholders who own BlackRock and then BlackRock invests in companies with the money provided by investors?,;,; 2024-02-15 17:27:20]

[At what point will index fund investing stop working?,;,; The money in an index fund is used to purchase shares of all the equities in the index. The underlying intrinsic value and performance of those equities will never be considered by the shareholders.  As many are quick to point out, most big cap stocks are currently heavily overpriced. For example, [Pepsi]( currently costs $38.67 per $1 of profit today. Who would pay that price for a company that only [grows]( ~8% per year at best? Its top three [shareholders]( are Vanguard, State Street and Black Rock.  How much of the blame for overpricing goes to passive investors who shovel money into everything regardless of its value or performance? I'm perfectly guilty of this myself of course.  Passive investors dream of cashing out on that compounded 9.1%/year growth of the S&amp;P 500 over time, and we can all backtest and see that past performance. But we can't really backtest the ever-increasing observer effect that index investing must have over time.  To get to the point, at what point does the S&amp;P 500 simply track the performance of index funds and render the stock market a meaningless Ponzi scheme? Or have I simply gone bonkers to think about this, and if so, what am I missing?  Charlie Munger has often [pointed out]( that index investing doesn't work if everyone does it. Are any economists studying the notion that index investing itself is poisoning the market averages that seem harder and harder for stock pickers to beat every decade?,;,; 2023-06-04 00:14:39]
[Would you fire my advisor?,;,; I moved to a new financial advisor in July 2022. Portfolio value at the time was $800K. They sold all but two of my existing stocks (AAPL, AMZN) and invested heavily (but not exclusively) in consumer discretionary stocks. Results: 2022 down 11%, 2023 down almost 9% YTD. Overall, down close to 20%.   The new portfolio is extremely volatile, usually 1-2% swings each day, but today it went down ~4% due to huge losses in just two stocks. Some individual stocks are down 55-70% YTD; few are in the black. Just about every stock is performing worse than its respective market index.   In the case of the biggest losers, the chief investment officer basically went to the sunk cost fallacy - we (I) have lost so much we should just hold to see what can be recovered.    Right now I‚Äôm so angry about today‚Äôs loss (I didn‚Äôt mention the stock that lost 25% yesterday) that I dare not call or email until I can get a grip on my emotions.  I know that maybe except for the S&amp;P 500, the market‚Äôs performance has not been great this year, but my portfolio‚Äôs losses just seem so extreme that I think I need to stop working with these folks.

Some of these ‚Äúlines‚Äù kinda go against each other.   So i guess my question is, do I buy weekly no matter the price? Wait for a dip? Wait for the stock to be a fair price/bargain?

[ExxonMobil passed Tesla as the most shorted stock last month. Here are the 10 names investors are betting against the most.,;,; ExxonMobil was the most shorted large-cap stock in the S&amp;P 500 last month, according to HazelTree.    Tesla and Apple followed the energy giant in the large-cap sector, according to data from HazelTree.    Fund managers tracked by the firm also bet heavily against Rivian, SNAP, Ford, and AirBnB.  ExxonMobil Corp replaced Tesla as the most-shorted large-cap stock in the S&amp;P 500, according to a report from HazelTree.        Before last month, Elon Musk's car company had held the top spot as the most shorted stock for four consecutive months. When investors short a stock, they are betting that a company's share price will decline.         HazelTree ranks short bets with a "Crowdedness Score" of one to 99, with the highest level representing shares shorted by the greatest percentage of funds tracked by HazleTree. The firm collects data on 12,000 global equities and over 700 funds.        In the large-cap group, ExxonMobil and Tesla led the way with scores of 99 and 97, respectively, followed by Apple (94), Charter Communications (91), Broadcom (91), Rivian Automotive (86), US Bank Corp (83), SNAP (83), Ford (78), and AirBnB (78).         The three most-shorted names in the mid-cap sector included SOFI Technologies (99), American Airlines (92), and EV maker Lucid (92).         The report also highlighted the percentage of institutional investors' supply of a particular stock to be loaned to short sellers. In order to short a stock, an investor betting against a particular name must borrow the shares. It then sells them immediately. If the share price fall as expected, the short seller buys the shares back and returns them to the lender and pockets the difference in price.         HazelTree said it tracks how "hot" a stock is in terms of supply and demand from short sellers.         Rivian Automotive led the way in institutional supply utilization at 37%, well above ExxonMobil's 3.13% and Tesla's 2.67%.         Exxon is down about 6% year-to-date, while Tesla has gained a whopping 76% this year but is dealing with headwinds stemming from uncertain demand for electric vehicles and stiff competition that has led to price cuts on its vehicles over the course of 2023. ,;,; 2023-11-09 17:15:56]

[S&amp;p 500 Tech vs NASDAQ 100 vs Stocks for AI,;,; Greetings!     I wanna invest into AI and cant decide whats the best call there. I think most will agree that the best bet for AI is to invest into the Big Companys: Apple, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Meta, Google and Amazon. (Tesla not included because i dont like Elon tbh).     Investing into S&amp;P Tech will give me big Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA but not the other companys. Investing into NASDAQ 100 will give me all of them, but with a lower Rate (can be good can be bad). And of course i just can buy those 6 Stocks.     I think Apple (even if they dont have LLMs yet) will be big in AI in 1-2 Years and the capability shipping local AI on all of their devices are insane.  Huge potential here + we talk about Apple. Microsoft is playing the AI game better than anyone else right now and coming GPT Versions will slap. I also like the new approach of Meta and with LLAMA there is also huge Potential. NVIDIA is of course also a no brainer (even if some ppl think they are overvalued), they are way ahead of other companys like AMD right now. Amazon while not having insane LLMs right now, has of course on of the best Sectors to apply AI in general.     With alphabet i have to say, im not so sure. Their new Model is strong, but i kinda didn't feel good about the company as a whole. Hard to explain why.      What would you do and why if AI is the goal ?

Basically, no hedge or stop loss. Is this equivalent to a "yolo" in the stock market?    Lets discuss. I want to hear different perspectives,;,; 2023-10-16 20:40:04]
[Calculating Net Investment/ACB,;,; Anyone else do this or find logic in this ideology to keep track of their net investments or am I just misleading myself.  E.g.  I just sold a portion of my apple shares (35 shares) in which I had at an ACB of $95. Equals about $3,330 net investment  The proceeds of the sale at current price ($190) was about $6,600  I used that $6,600 to buy 16 MSFT and 1 AMD. If I now want to note my ACB‚Äôs for sake of my net investments I used the $3,330 number as my investment so the breakdown is as follows  16 MSFT = about $3,240 = $202/share 1 AMD = about $90/share  MSFT trading at $410 AMD trading at $178  Essentially since I didn‚Äôt add any new cash, and used my gains from Apple would it make sense to use the $202 and $90 as my share values.  Of course on my actual brokerage app it would show ACB according to current market price, this is more for the sake of my own records to know what i‚Äôve put in as net investments.  Thanks!,;,; 2024-01-30 16:08:59]
[Which indices or stocks do you follow to know how the market is going and why?,;,; What do you follow aside from the news that helps you understand the market and make decisions?  A few for me:  1. S&amp;P 500 2. FTSE 100 3. DAX 4. BTC 5. Apple 6. Tesla  I should add some gilts or something, but I'm not sure which ones.  And how do you keep track of these? Which apps do you use?,;,; 2024-02-16 21:45:23]
[Does it make sense to invest in individual large cap stocks AND an S&amp;P 500 ETF?,;,; As the post title asks:  If someone has a large amount invested in an S&amp;P 500 ETF like SPY or VOO, does it make sense to additionally purchase individual stocks like Microsoft and Apple? I understand the risk-reward difference for ETFs and stocks but it just seems redundant.,;,; 2023-09-28 13:17:11]
[Why do most people miss the outperformers on the stock market?,;,; I really don't get it.  In the late 80s, early 90s, Microsoft was everywhere.  In the early to mid 00s Apple was everywhere.  Same time Google became known to everybody on the planet.  I wanted to buy stocks then but I had practically no money and the bank told me, that investing in US stocks (I'm living in middle Europe) is only possible for big investors.  When I'm reading now that people didn't see it coming, that those stocks would go through the roof... I really have to ask: How blind can you be!?  Do I miss something?,;,; 2023-06-04 10:27:19]
[Does the stock market keep pace with the devaluation of money?,;,; When adjusting for inflation and the devaluation of USD, is the stock market is essentially moving in a horizontal line (particularly since the dot com bubble burst)?  The argument is that the devaluation of the dollar gives the illusion that stocks are increasing, when in reality it‚Äôs just that your dollar is just worth less. I think this argument assumes that inflation is much higher than the official CPI estimate.  I have seen a lot of graphs from the bitcoin community illustrate this point quite convincingly. I‚Äôd love to hear the counter-argument from the traditional finance community.  Thanks in advance,;,; 2023-02-20 12:10:39]
[Do you wash sales not matter if you clear all the positions at the end of the year?,;,; Say somebody day trades a lot of Apple stock in the portfolio and has a lot of wash sales as long as they exit and sell all of their Apple stocks at the end of the year (and take a 30 day pause) they should have no wash sales to calculate effectively right?,;,; 2023-06-13 00:49:36]
[Which one do you use and why: HYSA or Money Market Fund,;,; I‚Äôm seriously conflated between Apples high yield savings account or my fidelity money market fund (SPAXX).  I like the money market from Fidelity because it‚Äôs easier for me to transfer the money and it gives a decent return. However, I‚Äôm nervous regarding the fact that it is not FDIC insured.  I do like that Apple‚Äôs high yield savings account account is FDIC insured. You however I don‚Äôt feel like opening a new credit card just for the savings account since I already have the chase sapphire reserve card.  What are your thoughts?  Thank you.,;,; 2023-05-02 14:55:37]
[Income fund advice needed for $250k to invest,;,; I‚Äôm coming on a quarter mill that I‚Äôd like to turn into an income ‚Äúallowance‚Äù fund for myself.   The basics: I‚Äôm 48, have a decent job as a tech consultant pulling in $175k + RSUs. I‚Äôm soon to be divorced (no maintenance or child support required) and living in Tampa.   I‚Äôm currently renting and RE is an option although I‚Äôm not sure I want to buy on a bubble like what‚Äôs happening here. REITs are worth considering though.   I have about $750k in 401k funds, mostly being managed by Fidelity (that‚Äôs a whole other issue). I have an investment account with about $70k in it with a large chunk of that being Apple. Finally I have a good chunk in an account with RSUs and ESPP that have a current potential value of about $140k (expected more as the stock will likely surge over the next few months).   With so many positions in what I‚Äôd consider ‚Äúown, don‚Äôt trade‚Äù categories (like Apple) I‚Äôd like to have some of my money making cash for me. Money that I can use for vacations and toys so I don‚Äôt eat into underlying assets. Is a steady 10% even achievable?,;,; 2023-08-28 16:37:41]
[20 stocks till 2049 - buy and hold for 25 years,;,; Hello. Apologies if this has already been posted in this community.   I came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.    The idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.  So, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold.   So my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049.   Here is my list so far.   1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 ) 2. Costco 3. Johnson and Johnson 4. Waste Management 5. CVS 6. Home Depot 7. Boeing 8. Caterpillar 9. GE Aerospace 10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia 11. Walmart/Target 12. Starbucks / McDonalds 13. UPS 14. JP Morgan / Bank of America 15. Berkshire / Markel 16. Disney 17. Tesla / GM 18. Hershey 19. Dollar General 20. Lockheed Martin  Note that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate.   Feel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.  Edit: Some really good points in the comments.   1. Most of my regular investing goes to VOO. Think of this as a fun little experiment  2. Since all of these are mature large companies, maybe it makes more sense to go with mid cap stocks. In that case, what would you pick?,;,; 2024-01-18 21:13:00]
[Is NVDA really over valued long term?,;,; Title says it. If you‚Äôre looking to hold for 10-40 years is NVDA really overvalued? Let‚Äôs take Apple for example. On September 28, 2018, AAPL hit an all time high of $56.44. It was followed by a steep fall to high $30s in late 2018. Almost a 30% decline. I‚Äôm sure it hurt investors at the time. And I‚Äôm sure a lot of people were kicking themselves saying ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have bought at all time highs when it‚Äôs so overvalued.‚Äù However, if they held for about 5 years until today they‚Äôre probably thrilled to have bought for $56.44. I‚Äôd personally load the boat with AAPL these days. Sure their return isn‚Äôt as high as it could have been but timing the market is all but impossible. My point is, if you‚Äôre bullish on a company for strong reasons. The risk of overvaluation/draw down should not keep you sitting on the side lines. Time in the market beats timing the market. If you‚Äôre not bullish on NVDA please explain why?,;,; 2024-02-14 01:26:55]
[Roth IRA vs Cash vs Margin Accounts,;,; &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  I'm trying to understand if my math (and logic) is correct when comparing gains on like-trades but in different account types. For reference, my investment amount will be $200,000 via TD Ameritrade/Charles Schwab, 15% tax rate, and 13.00% effective margin rate. 28 years old. Employed. Not married. No children.  &amp;#x200B;  AAPL 2023 YTD performance is \~+55.25%. Past performance is not indicative of future results, I know. According to 1stock1, between 1981 and 2022, Apple has been positive 27 of those 42 years, with the strongest being +211.90% and the weakest being +5.42%. The average of the positive years is +67.8103704%. Apple has been negative 15 of those 42 years, with the worst being -71.06% and the least being -4.17%. The average of the negative years is -29.092%. 1995 to 1997 (3 years) was Apple's longest consecutive yearly losing streak. 2009 to 2014 (6 years) was Apple's longest consecutive yearly gain streak. The average of all 42 years is +33.202381%.  &amp;#x200B;  Roth IRA contribution limit in 2024 is $7,000. Non-deductible. Tax-free at distribution in retirement. $7,000 + 30% = $9,100. Gain of $2,100  &amp;#x200B;  Cash account of $7,000 + 30% = $9,100. Gain of $2,100 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $1,785  &amp;#x200B;  I can see that in this example, the Roth IRA is the better choice as opposed to the cash account. However, the Roth IRA is limited to the $7,000 annual contribution. Any additional investing must be done in the cash account. As a result, the current optimal solution would be to contribute into the Roth IRA up to the limit and invest the remaining $193,000 in the cash account and continuing the annual contribution into the Roth IRA in following years.  &amp;#x200B;  Margin account of $7,000 + $7,000 (margin) = $14,000. $14,000 + 30% = $18,200. Gain of $4,200 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $3,570 - my cost of margin for 1 year which is (.13 \* 7000) = Gain of $3,570 - $910 (margin) = Gain of $2,660.  &amp;#x200B;  I can see that in this example, with the same $7,000, AFTER taxes AND cost of margin, the margin account is the better choice as opposed to both the cash account and the Roth IRA. Similar to the cash account, I have no annual contribution limit, can withdraw at any time, and can invest the full $200,000. With margin, this amount becomes $400,000. As a result, the current optimal solution appears to be investing the full amount of $200,000 + $200,000 in the margin account and disregarding the Roth IRA entirely.  &amp;#x200B;  While I take much greater risks investing that amount in a margin account and having the knowledge/information that the average of Apple's yearly losses is \~-30%, over the long term, it's clear on paper that the optimal strategy is to go full margin, with the honest hope that the first 2-3 years are positive. I also expect my current effective margin rate of 13.00% to decrease as rates go down. I also expect my income to increase at a reasonable pace. I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning or not but I would like to marry and have children in the future.  &amp;#x200B;  Again, is my math (and logic) correct? Am I completely overlooking something?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks!!  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-12-22 17:56:12]
[Why are so many people against buying stocks instead of a fund?,;,; I keep seeing people tell others to invest in a fund. I understand that most people do not know enough to be real investors. However wouldn't it be better to buy several of the top stocks out there like amzn, apple, nflx, google, etc instead of a fund? When I look at a fund it may have gone up 30-50% over a few years. These other stocks go up much more than that over the same time span. If those stocks dip so do funds. So whats the benefit of a fund over safe stock picks?,;,; 2023-05-16 14:31:21]
[Long Term Stock Picks to Hold Forever,;,; I‚Äôve got a bit of a windfall coming from the sale of a rental property and I‚Äôm trying to decide where to invest the proceeds.  My ideal hold time for a stock is forever.  I‚Äôm looking for your thoughts on individual companies that are well positioned to take advantage of new trends in technology.    I‚Äôve already got substantial positions in MSFT, APPL, NVDA, GOOG, and AMZN so I feel like I don‚Äôt need to invest any more in the magnificent 7.

[Why would you not invest in Berkshire Hathaway ?,;,; Since 1965, Berkshire Hathaway has delivered an average annual return of almost 20% to its shareholders, compared to 10% for the S&amp;P 500.   When you see that, you want to invest in this company even if past performance is not indicative of futur results.   Why would you not invest in this company ?    When you see the numbers...      * Berkshire Hathaway is the 7th largest market capitalization, behind Nvidia, with a valuation of $790 billion. (In comparison, BlackRock, well-known to the general public, has a market capitalization of $105 billion.) * Berkshire Hathaway achieved $302 billion in revenue in 2022, a 9.37% increase from 2021. * BH has over $73 billion in cash reserves. * It holds stakes in companies like Coca Cola, Bank of America, and notably Apple, of which they own over 5%. It is basically an ETF (without dividends)     Warren Buffett is one of the world's best fund managers. He has some basic principles that we should all use:  * Invest only in businesses you understand, with favorable long-term prospects, led by competent management, and at reasonable prices. * Look for a long-term competitive advantage in a stable industry. * Seek exceptional companies at reasonable prices, not mediocre companies at bargain prices.        The Risks I see:     * The company's past performance has been incredible, but its current size will inevitably slow down its performance.  * Warren Buffet is 93 years old. What is going to happen to BH when he die ? Even that seems ok: It's known that Howard Buffet will be the future Chairman and Greg Abel the future CEO when Warren is no longer around. Greg Abel shares the same basic principles of management and investment as Warren Buffett. * Lastly, Warren Buffet is not exposed to Green and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) topics. Some consider him outdated in this regard.,;,; 2023-09-06 07:39:39]

[Support - Understanding warrants,;,; Hi. So I am a relatively new investor mainly in stocks and ETF's. Still I am trying to deepen my understanding of various instruments and was hoping you guys might help me out. I have been reading up on warrants I was hoping you guys might confirm my understanding or correct my misunderstanding :)  The online broker i am using has two types of warrants - Call and Put. Both have three characteristics 1) Strike price 2) delta 3) expiry date. Now my understanding is that by buying a call warrant i basicly buy the right to buy shares on a future date for a predefined price.   Examle: There are Calls on Apple shares. The strike price is USD 128 and the expiry date is 20.12.2024 and delta 0.81. So if i understand correctly by buying 1 warrant for EUR 7 I will have the opportunity to buy 1 Apple shate on 20.12.2024 for USD 128. The delta seems to be an indicator of the volatility of the Warrant.  I am pretty sure i am missing something as this sounds too good to be true. So basicly if i want to invest in Apple instead of investing USD 180 today in 1 Apple share, i could invest (buy) a warrant for EUR 7 with the same idea and if the share prices does increase i could excercise the warrant for USD 128 (USD 50 lower than the price if i buy a share to hold today). If the share price is lower than the strike price i wouldn't excercise the warrant while in the meantime i could have invested my money in other stocks.  I have a similar question for the put warrant but lets see first about the calls as I am pretty sure I am missing something,;,; 2023-06-13 20:32:44]
[Roth IRA Composition Advice,;,; Looking for some thoughts. Am I doing to much? I mostly looked for solid ETF's with low expense ratios. And mixed between Large/Med/Small cap. Under 30, will not be touching for a while 20+, max it every year.   Large cap   * VOO  * VUG  * VTI  Mid Cap   * BBMC   Small Cap  * VBK  * VB  Sectors  * VGT * VHT   I think it might be a bit much so I was thinking of dropping the small cap and VTI.   Also what are thoughts on CCRV? Seems to good to be true but it looks attractive for the div payout. No major growth but 30% yield. There has to be a catch, and I'm just not realizing it.    And what are thoughts on tossing some of the big holding in the large cap index's such as apple/XOM/msft/Amazon. I know the obvious, more risk but bigger upside and that's tempting but then i know there is a lot of apple in VGT/VOO for example.    I would probally go   25% VUG   20% VOO  BBMC 5%  VGT 20%  VHT 10%  CCRV 10%  Bluechips 10%    Thank you,;,; 2023-09-24 16:13:13]

[How can I use correlation coefficients to build a portfolio,;,; Hi all,  Before starting, I'll just point out that most of my portfolio is index funds and ETFs. But I do have maybe 10-15% in single stocks, just to satisfy the inner (wannabe) Buffett.  So we've all heard the advice that diversification is important when building a portfolio. Correct me if wrong, but this can mean across different stocks, or by diversifying across assets, like stocks and real estate.   I was looking for some online calculator that could find the correlation between two stocks and found this:    It lets you put two stocks and the time period to calculate the correlation between.   Could something like this be used just as a rudimentary tool. Either to see how whether you're actually as diversified as you think or to see you're not over concentrating in one area. Like investing in 5 different popular tech giants, which seems to be a thing some people do.   However, some results I found were a bit strange so not sure if that means using figures like these are not so useful? Eg, apple and Goldman Sachs had a correction of 0.8585 over the past 5 years and 0.9058 over the last 10 years. Or Nvidia and PepsiCo also having a correlation just over 0.85.   Are these figures just because stocks have generally all gone up over these time periods so the end result would be that mathematically they are correlated? Even though they are completely different industries/business models?  So can mathemical concepts/figures like these be useful, or do they not mean much since they are backwards looking, and it's better to diversify by knowledge of the different businesses. Such as, we might say intuitively that Apple and PepsiCo should be uncorrelated, no matter what price history suggests?  A final thought I'd like to hear opinions on, would be choosing from different industries based on the most diversification available.   Eg, you pick Microsoft and apple in the tech sector (not in your portfolio, just as two options available) and PG and PEP in, not sure the exact industry name, but say consumer products? You've done whatever prior research you saw fit to arrive at these businesses and now want to narrow things down for whatever reason.   And then have a 2*2 matrix with the different correlations between pairs. If there is a pair that might have significantly lower correlation than the other three, maybe you could pick that? Or is this still not very useful?,;,; 2024-01-07 21:43:24]

[What are your thoughts on Qualcomm?,;,; All,  Have been following and holding Qualcomm for about 2 years now. I know that smartphones is a cyclical industry and is currently in a slump. Qualcomm still has high inventory issues and have guided another quarter of falling revenues and earnings.  Having said that, **Qualcomm's intrinsic value based on DCF is around $156**   It is diversifying beyond smartphones and is aggressively pursuing automotive and IoT markets.  It also released a new chip that brings AI to smartphones. While the applications are limited to battery monitoring and camera improvements (hardware based) right now, they can easily move to other areas of enhancements.   Regarding loss of revenues from Apple, it will still take Apple 3-4 years to phase out existing devices that use Qualcomm chips. The 5 billion revenue Qualcomm gets from Apple will be covered by IoT + automotive by then.  Lastly, people can only delay buying a smartphone, not avoid it completely, especially buying high end phones. Which means once the slump is over, Qualcomm will make a very strong comeback.  Any thoughts? I want to buy more but would love to hear some critical arguments in the mean time.  Edit: Qualcomm's also making PC chips. Remains to be seen if they can eat Intel's lunch like AMD.   2023-05-30 17:33:52]

Recently a stock I hold was up and I almost sold it all to wait on the dip (which happened after the 1st) this would have put 100k into my pocket before taxes. I however would have been on the hook for 15 percent of the 500k in gain. So is it worth the risk to put a net 25 in my pocket and hope I sell high and buy low?

[WHO WOULD BUY INTO BITCOIN ETF?,;,; I know I‚Äôm late to this topic, but I want your take on bitcoin ETF, why or why not you‚Äôd buy into it.  For me, I‚Äôm still a bit iffy, which leads me to not buy into it. I still don‚Äôt see any real value in bitcoin all together. Yet, it‚Äôs enticing to buy into bitcoin, dispite its high volatility, to make huge profit. Only problem is, bitcoin is not backed by anything.

If so many non-bitcoin investors begin to invest in this ETF, this could possibly lead to the government approval of bitcoin. Yet, bitcoin itself is meant to be a currency without government interference. Flip side, could bitcoin have a huge spike in price. If that‚Äôs so, would buying bitcoin now be worth the risk?

[Sanity check: using individual bonds, brokered CDs, T-Bills so forth in place of bond funds,;,; I guess I am looking for thoughts or opinions (especially in terms of pros/cons, gotchas/things to watch out for, so forth) on using brokered CDs, individual bonds (corporate and/or government), T-Bills, Money Market Funds, 401(k) stable value fund, or some combination of the above instead of bond funds in my investment accounts. I know that doing this will likely require me to be more hands on with my portfolio, however, I think that might not be be a bad thing (at least not entirely). On the flip side, I can see where being more hands on with my portfolio may at least tempt me to play apple cart upset. I am 39 years old (will turn 40 later this year) so I have a good 25 - 30 years before retirement.  Bottom line: Am I crazy like a fox (or at least potentially so) or just plain crazy?

[The case for/against diversifying ex-USA?,;,; I've read many people rooting for ex-USA diversification. My question is, what would the drivers of growth be for the rest of the world vs the USA? I could see the case for emerging markets outperforming, but can't really see how developed markets like England, Germany, France, Japan, etc. could out of nowhere just start being super innovative/productive and start cranking out Teslas, Apples, and Microsofts.   I think at worst the US will perform similarly to these countries, and at best will keep on being the driver of innovation/tech in the world due simply to its culture of innovation and hardcore capitalism (which has many, many cons).   About to diversify into an international fund but really don't wanna. Thoughts?,;,; 2023-10-24 19:03:34]
[Transaction volume: when to avoid the "Buy" and "Sell" buttons?,;,; We all know human broker fees don't make sense 99.99% (repeating of course) of the time.

If I want to liquidate 100 million dollars of Apple shares (or a smaller company), I might move the market? At some point, it might make sense to work with a human broker?

[AMD and its (impressive?) P/E ratio,;,; I have a watchlist of 8 tech stocks and I was comparing the P/E ratios.  I see AMDs is largely out of place @ 1,084.39.  The other 7 (APPL, NVDA, GOOG, NVDA, TSLA, META, MSFT) and on average their P/E ratio is 48 (26:78).  So what gives?  Online I am reading that P/E is a gauge of investor sentiment on future growth in earning potential and is calculated based on prior 12 months of earnings.  AMDs P/E seems remarkable by comparison.  Does this not indicate that AMD is overbought?  edit: I was considering AMD for investment, given recent company news and its momentum has largely been positive over the long-term.  This number stands out to me, and it isn't a positive indicator in my mind.  Looking to reconcile my opinion after hearing some of yours - thanks!,;,; 2023-12-08 12:30:33]
[Should hedge fund performance be compared against that of broad indexes such as the S&amp;P500?,;,; I often see financial media compare hedge fund performance against the S&amp;P500 and other major stock-market indexes.

Companies such as Apple, Samsung, Intel and Nvidia have been reported to buy into this company to get some control.  Let's talk about this opportunity. What's people sentiment about this IPO?

[Is the IT industry experiencing a growth spurt, or is this a bubble?,;,; Bernard Arnault, the head of LVMH, may be the wealthiest individual in the world, but IT companies still hold the title of the most valuable. Even following the recent market adjustment, **Apple** boasts a valuation exceeding $2.6 trillion, with **Microsoft** at $2.34 trillion, and **Alphabet** at $1.56 trillion.  How can this be? **Don't large tech firms also face the threat of economic downturns?**  Indeed, they do. However, the members of the MAMAA conglomerate (Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet) took proactive measures to prepare for a potential economic slowdown by decreasing spending, which included a **reduction in labor costs**...  The recent **turbulence in the U.S. banking sector** has further funneled funds into the tech industry. Investors have shown a preference for companies boasting substantial profit margins and large cash reserves over more traditional safe-haven assets.  Another factor driving growth has been the **surge in Artificial Intelligence**. Investors anticipate that the capital injected into this sector will yield increased sales and, subsequently, elevated profits. Microsoft, for instance, anticipates a 6.7 percent revenue increase in the current quarter due to the rising demand for AI solutions.  Heading into 2023, the IT sector strikes a somewhat subdued chord: the Nasdaq Index suffered a decline of almost 33% in 2022. However, with **decreasing inflation** and the **prospect of a pause in Fed rate hikes**, tech stocks have regained their allure.  One also should not forget to note that key support propping up Nasdaq members was **stock buybacks**. Recall, too, that both Alphabet and Apple recently announced buybacks amounting to $70 billion and $90 billion respectively. Additionally, Meta, formerly Facebook, announced a stock buyback of $40 billion.  What lies on the horizon? **What are the analysts' predictions?**  Michael Landsberg, Chief Investment Officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management, asserts that [large tech stocks are currently overvalued]( For example, Microsoft shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 34.3, while Amazon's PE ratio (TTM) stands at 273.79.  On the other hand, analysts at Bank of America [do not foresee any reason for alarm]( and they predict that the flourishing market will persist.  So **what should we anticipate next?** If the Fed deviates from its hawkish stance, the rally could possibly extend. If not, the recent market correction may appear minor in comparison to what could transpire. Additionally, the approaching debt ceiling deadline could provoke another stock market adjustment, as new Treasury debt issuance could drain Fed reserves and curtail liquidity.,;,; 2023-05-24 15:02:49]

[Currency risk management by buying US equities in European Stockmarkets.,;,; Could someone please tell me if my thinking is correct?   At this moment I own APPL stock listed on the NASDAQ in USD.  I believe the dollar will weaken within the next 2 years as the ECB continues to increase interest rates.

[Meta shares pop 12% after company reports first sales increase in four quarters, issues optimistic guidance,;,; Article:   Meta's first-quarter sales rose 3% from $27.91 billion a year earlier, after three straight periods in which revenue declined.  For the second quarter, Facebook parent Meta expects revenue of between $29.5 billion and $32 billion, while analysts were expecting sales of $29.5 billion, according to Refinitiv.  "We had a good quarter and our community continues to grow," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. The company is "becoming more efficient so we can build better products faster and put ourselves in a stronger position to deliver our long term vision," he said.  Meta's Reality Labs unit, which is developing the virtual reality and augmented reality technologies for the metaverse, brought in $339 million in sales but logged an operating loss of $3.99 billion. The company added that operating losses in Reality Labs will increase this year.    Net income companywide fell 24% to $5.71 billion, or $2.20 per share, from $7.47 billion, or $2.72 per share, in the same quarter last year.  Restructuring charges reduced Meta's earnings per share by 44 cents.  Meta said that total expenses for 2023 will be in the range of $86 billion to $90 billion. That figure includes restructuring costs that range between $3 billion to $5 billion.  Capital expenditures will remain in the range of $30 billion to 33 billion. That figure accounts for its increased artificial intelligence investments and its ad-supported products like the newsfeed and Reels, the company said.  The after-market rally further boosted a stock that's been on an upward trend since Zuckerberg announced in February that 2023 would be the company's "year of efficiency."  The shares lost two-thirds of their value in 2022, but were up 74% this year, prior to the earnings report. Including the post-report surge on Wednesday to over $234, the shares are up about 164% from their November 2022 low of around $89.  Investors have rallied around Zuckerberg's plans to slim down his company through a series of layoffs, resulting in some 21,000 expected job cuts. The revenue base had been shrinking from a battered online advertising market and the lingering effects of Apple's 2021 iOS privacy update that dramatically limited ad-targeting capabilities.,;,; 2023-04-27 01:15:42]
[About business strategies,;,; In the last few years there were a lot of articles on McDonald's about expanding their business model. They started to buying real estate in the whole world and now they make most of their earnings through real estate.  Other Companies adopted, expanded or switched their strategy too. Either for external reason and some for internal ones. Most of them are pretty reasonable in hindsight, but were innovative when introduced. For example:  * Apple expanded from hardware to service ecosystem * Apple switched from just buying chips to designing them (peak with the M-series) * obviously, Netflix changed from physical copies to streaming * when the clothing industry went heavy on offshoring in the 90's (?) * US Digital companies optimized their business through tax optimization (in EU through Ireland) * Surprisingly the industry in the agricultural sector is leading in many new innovations like autonomous driving/automation with leaders like Deere.  My question is, where can i find more information about this? Are there any good books, documentaries, videos etc. you can recommend?   What are strategies, which impressed you or you find really remarkable?

That was a period of seemingly unlimited money printing, a zero interest rate environment, the economy firing on all cylinders and profits out of control. It seems to be a period that most people agree was frothy in hindsight.  Yet here we are testing those all time highs.

I sold Nvidia a couple months ago thinking it would reverse after its huge rise and it actually continued to grow until now.   What are your thoughts about this? Should I just hold it all?

[Is there anything to stop an ETF from becoming "too overvalued"?,;,; Since ETFs are easy to buy and have super low fees, they are an attractive option for people.  If I have $1000 and want to easy access to cheap, diversified stocks, I can buy any number of S&amp;P500 or total market ETFs in a couple clicks.  I'll use ticker SPY for this example.  If enough people do this, if would seem like the price could be driven up, beyond (and eventually, far beyond) the price of the underlying assets.  I spendy $1000 today, and looking at the info page on my broker, I am roughly entitled to $70 of Apple, $65 of Amazon, on down the line until I have $0.002 of some other company, all totalling $1000.  Someone else comes along and buys SPY, buy since I've bought the shares I did, they end spending $1000.45 on the next available shares.  If a few million people do this, and people aren't willing to sell SPY at the same price, theoretically, you could see the lowest shares available going up, say to $1200 for the same assets... despite the underlying shares only having moved a little.  At some point, I'd think it could be a problem.  Even if people are just overpaying a few percent.  Could this happen in real life?  Does it?

Me, with a few days left in the year have underperformed the S&amp;P by about 10 basis points.

I made a lot of changes to my portfolio this year eliminating all bonds and going 100% stocks as this is a taxable account.  I put all the bonds in my IRAs.    I was also heavily overweighted to dividend stocks at the beginning of the year which contributed to my underperformance.  I dumped some of those and lowered allocations to others which allowed me to substantially increase my allocation to tech and the mag 7.

I think back in the day people relied more on conventional media like newspapers and journals, but these days, such information/news is a lot more scattered. What are some more consolidated sources where I can read about smaller companies on the stock market whereby I can determine for myself the growth potential of the company.  EDIT:   I just want to clarify that my intention with this post is not to find the next small company that is going to boom. My goal here is to try and be able to find a reputable source that is better able to inform me on what smaller publicly traded companies are doing/future plans. I may invest, but I want to be able to be well informed on such companies. Back in the day, the answer to this might have been WSJ or NYT, but I am not confident that those are the best sources in the current day and age.,;,; 2024-01-25 18:28:12]

[Net Income Margin vs Return on Capital,;,; I continue to study investing from a value and fundamentals perspective. If Ben Graham were to call me an investor rather than a speculator, I'd be quite pleased.  Consider this comparison of net income margin (NIM) and return on capital (ROC).  LOW      8.5% NIM    29% ROC  AMGN   28.% NIM    10.9% ROC  These two names provide a good contrast in NIM vs ROC. Both trade at a reasonable multiple.  I've done well in capital intensive companies like Chevron, Exxon, UPS, and Olin. But I can't ignore what I've learned most recently about ROC. The obvious example of a smashing success with good ROC is Apple.  Interestingly, BRKA has 22% NIM and 9.8% ROC. Buffet has extolled the virtues of ROC, but his company puts up better numbers in net income than return on capital.  I can look at numbers all day. The thing I'm asking you folks about is the "Why?" Why would I choose excellent ROC over average NIM and vice versa. Additionally, I always find that I have a blind spot. What am I not considering?,;,; 2024-01-19 06:09:21]
[Is it possible to move SOME of my investments to a new brokerage, but not others without simply selling them all and buying them back?,;,; I have a taxable eTrade account.  (My 401k is through a financial advisor.)  Over the past 20 years, it's grown quite a bit.  I have never used another brokerage company besides etrade before, so I don't really know what I am doing.  About 85% of my money is in nice safe index funds, like QQQ, SPY, etc.  I also have another 5% in BRK.  Safe stuff.  Serious stuff.  Taxable, but not exactly gambling.  Then I have a bunch of "play money" equities, which is about 10%.  Someone gives me a stock tip, and I put a couple thousand in so I can have skin in the game.  Or I buy a company I like and want to follow along.  Everything from McDonald's to Pepsi to Royal Caribbean.  I have about a dozen stocks at any given time that I like to buy and sell and have fun with.  These stocks keep me interested in following business news.  My problem:  I want to separate the serious investments from the play money.  The play money clutters up the portfolio.  So I think I'd like to set up another account on Vanguard.  Questions:  - Do I just sell all of my "play stocks" and buy them back on Vanguard.  Or is it possible to simply transfer them?  - I know this is silly, but I like to see things like "Apple up 12,000+% since you bought it in 2005."  (It was only a couple shares. Not enough to make me rich.)  If I transfer, I lose that metric, right?  - Do I have to worry about a taxable event if I transfer them to Vanguard?  How do I handle that?   (USA)  - Is it a good idea to have 2 brokerage accounts (simply for the sake of "decluttering"), or am I overthinking this?  Does anyone else do it this way?   Thank you for any thoughts and advice.,;,; 2024-01-18 16:04:48]
[Investing discussion on a US-China war: which US companies will be the winners and losers, and which will just pull through?,;,; Apologies for how political this is. I couldn't see in the rules any issue relating to posting political-related discussion, but this is a very relevant and important question I'd like to discuss among investors, seeing the growing tensions between the US and China. The majority of my stocks are in US companies, despite not living in the US, so I will be effected regardless.   Looking at history, war time isn't necessarily economic woe for all companies. During WWII the Ford company supplied the US military with vehicles and war supplies. Other companies were similarly pulled in, and many actually greatly benefitted from their involvement in some way or another.   The question is, what do you all think could be some notable winners, losers, or companies who are able to pull through (whether they win or not)? Of course I see companies like Nvidia and Intel being heavily involved in supplying chip technology and research to the US military. I'm sure Apple is in a similar position.   Are there any winners though?,;,; 2023-08-27 09:07:22]
[Entertaining recommendation for spare change in IRA,;,; Finally rolled over some old 401K's from Fidelity into an IRA in my Schwab account.     Put the money in, bought a few thousand shares of some ETF's and life is ok.  Managed to allocate all but $0.06 (6 cents) which I was wiling to ignore.  Since then I've gotten a little bit of interest and cash in my IRA has creeped up to ~$2.50.  Not enough to really do anything with, but I'd rather buy a fractional share of something that can attempt to grow or create dividends rather than leave it in cash.   Plus if more cash shows up I'd like to start figuring out a plan.  So any thoughts on stocks that would be worth throwing spare change at?    And, to be fair, i could just buy a 2% fraction of Apple or some other MANGA stock, or buy an old blue chip or Coke or whatever.... but what would be more entertaining to see in my IRA that won't risk the spare change too much?  $2 invested into a dildo company just for the laughs would be far more amusing than $2 in Tesla.,;,; 2023-12-19 21:17:30]
[How do I diversify? Trying to move out of single stocks into ETFs.,;,; I have a taxable brokerage account worth about 260k currently.   There are currently 93 positions and account is mainly being carried by big tech stocks (Apple/AMD/Tesla) and a bunch of others for 1-2k each gain/loss.  How do I go about the process of getting out of these single stocks into ETF/Index Funds? I am worried about having to pay taxes on anything I sell but is this just part of the game?

I have time on my side so I want to be aggressive and one fund my account offers is FGKFX which Im currently mostly invested in.        I can get \~50 shares or so per paycheck because its NAV right now is \~21.36        Im thinking about a few funds like XLK and SMH ETFs where one its more heavily investing in Apple and MSFT and the other is investing more in Semiconductors (specific focus). Both those ETFs offer a lower expense ratio than FGKFX, but the thing im thinking about is their price, right now they both trade in the $160+ range so that means Id be getting maybe a few shares every few weeks.        I know past performance does not guarantee future performance but both of those funds have performed very nicely!        Does it make sense to make a switch?,;,; 2023-12-03 22:04:50]

[TSM - a technical play on chips, AI.,;,; [  For those not in the know TSM fabs like 50% of apple chips, all NVDA chips. They are the most sophisticated chip fabrication plant on the globe.   TSM is hanging right around the bottom of the channel of the uptrend.   now this is a solid company, solid financials, 2% annual dividend, diversifying into arizona (with struggles) and germany (with both comes a lesser ability to produce chips than the main Taiwan factory), which removes **some** of the risk of being solely in Taiwan. Maybe a japan factory as well?  If you bought around 93-92 dollars, set a stop loss at say 87 or 86 being a significant break in trend, or maybe even as low as 84 or 83, a real break in the trend, you would lose somewhere between 6.5% to 10%.   now if TSM continues the uptrend and we go to 100 you are up 7.5%  if we go to 105 youre up 12.9%  if TSM suprasses a high on its trip down in 2022 around 109 to hit 110, you're up 18.2%  and it just continues up from there, i mean you hit 115 and the risk reward is totally worth it. So you're a long term holder buying into the bottom of the uptrend and setting a stop loss around 88-87, 5-6% risk to make maybe 20% on the high upside, maybe 12.9-7.5 on the lowside.   its a decent bet.   full disclosure i think hanging around the bottom of the trend shows a little uncertainty but it also is opportunity for you. i bought days ago.   &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-09-04 03:22:59]
[Avantis AVGE Holdings Data/Study,;,; I'm developing an application related to ETF portfolios (the goal is to be able to analyze intersection, diversification between countries, categories, portfolio trend \[small to large, value to growth map\], etc).  Anyway. An ETF that I really like is **AVGE**, from Avantis. If I could summarize it in a few words, it would be the "VT with tendency to the value factor". It is a "fund of funds" with the following composition:  * Avantis U.S. Equity ETF (42.78%) * Avantis U.S. Large Cap Value ETF (15.05%) * Avantis International Equity ETF (10.89%) * Avantis Emerging Markets Equity ETF (6.37%) * Avantis International Large Cap Value ETF (5.49%) * Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (4.95%) * Avantis U.S Small Cap Equity ETF (4.86%) * Avantis Emerging Markets Value ETF (4.28%) * Avantis Real Estate ETF (3.00%) * Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF (2.17%) * State Street Institutional Investment Trust US Government Money Market Fund Institutional (0.09%)  I got this information from the website [etf.com/avge]( But I would like to go further. I would not like to see the funds that make up these funds, I want to see the holdings that make up the funds of that fund.  So, with a little bit of programming I was able to extract this information and publish it in this github repository. There are two CSV, of which:  * [avge-holdings-ungrouped.csv]( In this CSV I have not grouped the repeated companies. You will be able to see the weight of each holding in each of the funds. Example: APPL represents 4.78% of AVUS (which represents 42.78% of AVGE) and at the same time represents 2.98% of AVLV (which represents 15.05% of AVGE). * [avge-holdings-grouped.csv]( This CSV shows the actual participation of a given company in AVGE. So, for example, the APPL that is part of AVUS and AVLG, its real weight is 2.49% (4.78%\*42.78% + 2.98%\*15.05%).  And, just to make the post more graphic, I end with the list of the 10 biggest AVGE positions.  |Name|Ticker|Weight| |:-|:-|:-| |Apple Inc.|AAPL|2.49%| |Microsoft Corporation|MSFT|1.56%| |Exxon Mobil Corporation|XOM|0.92%| |Meta Platforms Inc. Class A|META|0.85%| |JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co|JPM|0.80%| |Chevron Corporation|CVX|0.77%| |Merck &amp; Co., Inc|MRK|0.76%| |Alphabet Inc. Class A|GOOGL|0.63%| |Pfizer Inc|PFE|0.56%| |Alphabet Inc. Class C|GOOG|0.55%|  The fund's 10 largest positions add up to **9.91%**. It's a pretty small value when compared to growth ETFs like QQQ, VUG, etc.  # Next goals (which I will do when I have time):  * Compare the percentage portfolio between AVGE and VT; * Get the country and sector of each of the 9824 holdings. In this way I will be able to carry out a study of the geographic and sectorial diversification of AVGE. I'll probably use ChatGPT to help me with this because I haven't found any api that can give me this information easily.,;,; 2023-04-20 19:01:28]

[Query - What has more impact on an index like NASDAQ-100?,;,; NASDAQ-100 closed at 12302.48 yesterday. The previous close was 12290.81. So it gained 11.67 points yesterday. Now percentage wise, the highest price gain was by Enphase Energy, Inc. (ENPH) 3.77% 1.11 Billion, but the increase in market capitalization was highest by Apple (AAPL) 1.85%  41.5 Billion.   According to Wikipedia, NASDAQ-100 is "modified capitalization-weighted index." So am I right in my inference that though ENPH went up by 3.77%, this would have a much lesser impact on the index price than AAPL going up by 1.85%?     Similarly, Dexcom (DXCM) was the biggest loser at -7.87% (-3.63 B), but Tesla was biggest loser as per market cap -2.01% ( -13.98 B).     Smaller changes in bigger companies ( by market cap ) impacts the index more.  Would this be a correct assumption?,;,; 2023-03-07 09:16:57]
[Should I stay in blue chip/ETF combination for long-term investing?,;,; In 2021, I received an inheritance. At the time, I invested around 20% of that inheritance into each of the following: Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, and VTI.        I since then have learned that diversifying and index/ETF funds are a safer way to go for long-term investing, which is definitely my goal. And I'm still around 20% in VTI.         But with that in mind, I don't know if I should necessarily sell off any stock from the four tech companies right now. I could, and put that money into index/ETF, but they are all now turning some profit and mostly seem like safe companies at the moment.        Again, I now know diversifying is key and index/ETF are safer moving forward, but at this point with where I currently am, what actions would you recommend?,;,; 2023-08-08 17:18:07]
[Just how big are the Magnificent Seven?,;,; This is a big quote from MarketWatch. I‚Äôve seen the numbers before, but this really gave me pause.   &gt; These captains of the SS S&amp;P 500 are Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla. They've been described as the magnificent seven by many news organizations. Fortunately for me, there's a common thread among this group. They are the only U.S. companies that have ever been valued at a trillion dollars by the public markets. To say these companies are dominating the S&amp;P 500 is a giant understatement. Last year, their collective valuation gained more than $5 trillion. Compare that to the S&amp;P 500's valuation gain of less than $8 trillion. That means the trillionaires were responsible for roughly 65% of the Index's market cap gain last year, despite comprising just 1.4% of its components. But doesn't this go against the main reason behind investing in S&amp;P 500 index funds? Wouldn't the entire index be susceptible to a massive drop if just one of these seven companies failed?  &gt; Phil Van Dorn: Well, I like index funds because they spread out your risk over many stocks and because the expenses are so low. In the mutual fund industry, traditionally, you might be looking at expenses of 1% of assets under management per year, and that can really pile up over time. But with an S&amp;P 500 Index Fund, your expenses get close to zero. But as you have mentioned when you called the group of expensive stocks the Trillionaires' Club, a small group of companies now make up between 27 and 30% of the S&amp;P 500 depending on which day you look at it.  &gt; Jeremy Owens: Right, so that's seven out of 500 companies accounting for more than a quarter or less than a third of the entire market cap of the S&amp;P 500 and really swaying the underlying metrics. What should an investor kind of take from this and how should we look at the S&amp;P 500 moving forward, knowing how much these companies matter?  &gt; Phil Van Dorn: One can say that there's a heck of a lot of risk in the seven companies that make up only 1% of the S&amp;P 500, but make up close to a third of its value. However, the S&amp;P 500 is self-correcting. It rewards success.,;,; 2024-01-20 00:51:08]
[Is there any reason whatsoever that a "smart beta" ETF which has a long term track record of beating the S&amp;P would be a bad investment long term?,;,; So with my current living situation I'm able to invest about $3800 ever 4 weeks. This has led to me wanting to take the opportunity to diversify my portfolio with some ETFs other than the typical  One of my reasons is that I already invest a hefty amount into funds which have majority Apple and Microsoft. I don't want my entire life's and retirement savings to be 30% dependent on 2 stocks no matter what they are.  I have found many ETFs which buy S&amp;P500 stocks based on various performance indicators. Some are quite speculative which doesn't interest me. But others are based on things such as quality factor, cash flow, volatility, etc.  A couple of examples are MOAT which is based on companies which have a wide moat, or competitive advantage, which would be difficult for competitors to overcome. Another is SPHQ which is based on quality factor.  Both of these ETFs have a 10 year return of higher than the S&amp;P500 despite both being based on S&amp;P stocks. They're just weighted and selected differently. Clearly this has been working and those strategies logically seem like they'd be successful  My question is why are these ETFs and others like them not as popular as the most common bulk, market cap weighted S&amp;P ETFs? Their long term annualized returns obviously made the extra expense ratio worth it for the past decade. Their portfolios logically make sense to me. They do still own a lot of the same stocks just at lower percentages of the overall holdings  This seems like a no-brainer: they are more diversified with better long term track records. This seems too easy. What am I missing? Is it just most people aren't looking super deep into ETFs like this, so just go with the standard options?,;,; 2023-08-21 01:43:15]

[Has anyone heard that a portfolio balanced equally by sector will beat the S&amp;P 500 over time?,;,; I was just speaking with a (potential) financial advisor today. He discussed, for example how the S&amp;P 500 is way overweighted in tech, particularly because 7 of the top 10 holdings are all megatech giants: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, Google/Alphabet (twice), and Tesla. These 7 alone make up 21% of the value of the S&amp;P 500.  Obviously, this leads to underweighting in other sectors. And this leads to underperformance and increased volatility over long periods of time. As evidence of this, he brought up a chart that showed that if you equally weight your investments across the various sectors (financials, materials, utilities, healthcare, etc.), that it would outperform the S&amp;P 500, provided that you rebalance periodically.  Has anyone heard of an investment portfolio like this? I did a little research, and it looks like for periods of 15 years or greater, this is right - an portfolio that's equally weighted by sector, and rebalanced periodically, will outperform the S&amp;P by 1.5% to 2% annually.  I'd love to hear your thoughts about this. Anyone have a portfolio like this? Is there some kind of equal weighting ETF or mutual fund that does this automatically? Thanks.,;,; 2023-02-28 09:15:41]

[Unique asset stocks for my retirement fund,;,; Been thinking about building an, in theory, defensive portfolio for my pension. Having similar parallels to global brand funds but with a more tangible moat, unique assets. For example my thoughts are that nike is a global brand, but not a unique asset. A few names that i think fit my bill are Canadian Pacific, ASML, Linde, Nintendo/Disney, Apple. These are all businesses in a monopoly, oligopoly, historic IP or entrenched ecosystem. Do you think any of these names are disputable? Would like to here peoples own suggestions for companies? Or even if you think the whole premise is flawed?  Edit: I have 30 years before I touch this pot and fully accept the risk of an equity portfolio.

[Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market?,;,; Looking at historical data, does it show that this is the worst time to ever invest in the stock market? I say that by looking at the data. For example. Amazon trades at 100x earnings and grows 15 percent a year. That is a terrible stock for anyone trying to actually get a return from the asset itself, but trading it is potentially profitable like it is for every single stock. Also I have another example. Nvidia trades at like 35 x sales. The margins are high but obviously companies like Meta will inevitably have to roll out their own independent GPU solutions to control costs, and therefore the stock itself looks ungodly expensive. The same is looking at arm. Arm which trades at like 150 x earnings, or something crazy, literally grows at like 28 percent. That means it will takes like 26 years to even get a 10 percent return for the equity.  Then, if you look at what stocks were trading at in like 2004, Apple, it was like 33 x earnings with higher revenue growth, a tiny market cap, better leadership. This compared to the 2000's investing environment or earlier is terrible, yet it seems people think that they can make investments whenever they want.     It goes on and on. Looking at Palantir which trades at a crazy multiple, or basically any software company, yes it's possible to buy Palantir or any stock and it triple, but trying to get earnings at a good multiple in other words, Real INVESTING seems to be literally impossible right now.     Even the chinese stock market has collapsed mainly due to companies like Alibaba growing at only 5 percent their topline.      And there are questions like how is this possible and is this partly due to extremely irresponsible Fed reserve activity mainly due to QE pushing valuations to their highest levels ever. Also do the people here think that this is the worst investing environment ever when compared to historical pe ratios?,;,; 2024-02-13 14:28:31]

With a strong lineup of games for the rest of the year and into 2024 as well as the opening for competition in the AR goggle/ glasses world with the introduction from Apple (strictly my opinion) it seems Microsoft should do extremely well for the rest of the year. How does this injunction and blockage from the FTC effect stock prices moving throughout the rest of the year?    2023-06-14 13:12:02]
[Wheel Strategy Idea: Super itm,;,; So, I've been doing some thinking/analysis about the wheel strategy. Some appeals to it are the guaranteed premiums it brings in, the relatively small risk it has, and the ability to be flexible in most markets (assuming you're wheeling a good stock).   Usually, you try to sell your initial put otm for a chance at more later and to not get assigned at an "upcharge." Some people are able to make this their full time job. Here's what I've been thinking: What if you were to sell the put way itm? With enough collateral (I played around with the numbers) you could take a year's salary in the form of one premium on a single, week-long put. You would obviously be assigned, but you'd have an entire year to make up the difference by selling cc's, the stock going up, and dividends. Selling super safe calls (staying way itm) every week should in theory be enough to cover the "salary" as well as churn a profit for most of the stocks I analyzed (Nvidia, Apple, even VOO). And to me, it seems even safer than buying and holding, due to the "salary" being instant.   Is this the GOAT of trading? Or does this belong in r/wallstreetbets?,;,; 2023-09-17 13:04:48]
[How many individual stocks in your eyes is too much?,;,; Out of curiosity how many individual stocks in your eyes is too much?   My train of thought behind my pickings is that I allocate the majority of my money to a world index so I‚Äôm not overweighting a particular sector or region but then allocate a small portion of my funds to individual stocks that I personally use day to day and have high confidence in.  For reference, 66% of my money is tied up in a world index (VWRL). 12% is tied up in small cap index funds. 50% in USA and 50% in Europe. (ZPRV and ZPRX)  11% is tied up in individual stocks. The list of stocks are:  Amazon - I use this quite frequently since I‚Äôm a member.  Apple - I use their tech.  Microsoft - familiar with their business model and use their software such as word and PowerPoint.  Meta - I use instagram and WhatsApp, I don‚Äôt use Facebook but its power in advertising is immense.  Johnson &amp; Johnson - leader in health such as vaccines.  Visa &amp; Mastercard - I personally use Mastercard but both are identical and leaders.  Alphabet - I use their software.  AMD - gaming as they‚Äôre used in Xbox and PlayStation plus their future in AI. Taking market share from intel.  Berkshire Hathaway - diversified  McDonald‚Äôs - real estate company that sells food.  JP Morgan - leading bank that is diversified.  Caterpillar - leading manufacture in mining/ agriculture/ construction machinery. Plus I‚Äôve got a placement sorted with them so there‚Äôs a bit of bias lol.  Nvidia - leader in AI and GPU production.  Walmart - powerhouse in America.  Costco - their membership model is cash flow powerhouse plus they‚Äôre present in numerous countries.  Waste management - trash will always be here.  ASML - absolute gem of a company and many years ahead of any competitors. Every tech company is reliant on them.  Airbus - I love planes and their business is far more desirable than Boeing.  Lockheed Martin - peace was never an option.  Once again, I‚Äôve chose to invest into these companies individually as I want to overweigh them as I‚Äôm more confident in them than others. I‚Äôm willing to put my money where my mouth is. I‚Äôm aware they‚Äôre contained in the world index. I don‚Äôt do any technical analysis, it‚Äôs all confidence and familiarity.  I also invest in REITs, I invest into leading REITs in each sector such as industrial, data etc. 11% of my portfolio is in REITs. 10 in total. I use alreits to track them, and track them quarterly.  I don‚Äôt plan on selling until retirement. Currently 19.  Thanks.,;,; 2024-02-17 17:00:00]
[Is regulation on private credit too strict?,;,; I'm intrigued by the stringent regulations surrounding private debt products, especially given the limited accessibility for retail investors. The availability private debt products is rather restricted, with only a few ETFs accessible to the public, and Private Credit Funds reserved for high-net-worth individuals. On a theoretical level, debt instruments like loans and bonds seem more suitable for non-expert investors due to their typically lower volatility and seniority in the capital structure, ensuring repayment priority in case of bankruptcy.     Consider the scenario where a retail investor is prohibited from acquiring a portion of a private corporate loan issued to a highly liquid and information-disclosed entity like Apple. On the flip side, these same investors can readily engage in options trading through platforms like Robinhood. This regulatory incongruity raises questions about the rationale behind limiting access to seemingly lower-risk investments while allowing participation in more complex and risk-laden options trading.     While I acknowledge the liquidity aspect, where bond investments typically involve a committed holding period compared to the more fluid nature of equity transactions, I wonder if there are additional facets to this regulatory framework that I might be overlooking. Any nuanced insights into this regulatory dichotomy would be greatly appreciated.,;,; 2023-11-17 12:29:03]
[Inflationary graph with no results,;,; I was just wondering the mechanism by which a stock like Domino's Pizza can zoom by over 3,000% over a decade and still only have a market cap of 11B. I was looking to see how they fare as an investment, given all the other struggling businesses, and if I had bought in 2010, it looks to have been a better investment than Apple, but the difference is that Domino's evaporates their money while Apple doesn't, even though the stock chart only shows more climbing. I have seen other charts like this, but this may be one of the more egregious examples.  My best theory is that they are reducing the amount of shares in circulation steadily over time to keep the price high. So I wonder a couple things: would an investor have actually made 3,000% during this time period, or would their holdings be continually adjusted to reflect the shares float? I guess I'm confusing that with split rules, but it doesn't make sense to make that much money on a business that's barely solvent. And my other question is, if someone had enough cash to short a high-priced stock like this today, would it be a good play given the fragility of the space and the way the stock has been manipulated? I would expect nothing but a quick catastrophe from such a bad business model.  I have a hard time gaining traction and support for my reddit threads when I make them, so I just want to clarify what was eyebrow-raising about the subject of this post. If the market cap is 11B, and they show growth of 3,300% over 13 years, then their capitalization must have been like $3.50, a couple of spare buttons and some pocket lint. Whatever they were doing to keep their graph looking nice while either losing or stagnating could not have helped the overall health of the stock. I think a symptom of the disease they gave themself is that despite a market cap of only 11B, the share price is over $300. I suppose they could split their shares, but it'd have to be like 20-to-1 to have their share price make sense for their market cap. Anyway I didn't mean anything bad by this post, I'm just probably not altogether coherent, but who really is? Who among you has all their ducks in a row, their head seated firmly upon their shoulders? I'm skeptical about the stability of my critics. I'd say they're all similarly flying by the seat of their pants as I am wont to do.,;,; 2023-07-03 13:33:41]
[Is the acquired date of a stock the same date if you set up reoccurring?,;,; Let's say you bought apple stock last year and now you've decided to set up reoccurring investments in 2023. Since I want to hold a while and capitalize on long term capital gains, would the date of acquisition be when I initially bought my first share, or when I bought my last reoccurring investment? It would make more sense to me for my acquisition date to be when I made my first buy, but thought i'd check. I'm obviously doing this to save on taxes.,;,; 2023-02-26 02:09:47]
[Could increasing interest rates be inflationary?,;,; Let me be clear that by posting this for discussion, I **am not agreeing** with the theory. Personally, I think it sounds crazy, but what the heck do I know compared to Actual Economists, right?  I was listening to [this podcast]( last night and the guest, Warren Mosler, says that because the debt-to-GDP ratio is so high, increasing interest rates no longer combat inflation. Rather, increasing the amount of interest that the government pays on its bonds leads to more interest income paid out to everyone and everyone takes that interest and spends it.  This NYT article from a little while back also includes rebuttals from various other economists for a more balanced view: [  Anyways, this feels like, pardon the language, pure copium bullshit to me. But it's interesting enough food for thought to share. If this theory is somehow right, then we could be in for a nasty respike in inflation once all these interest rate hikes take effect in the economy.,;,; 2023-03-05 04:49:23]

[Rebalancing Portfolio Suggestions,;,; I decided to really start investing about a decade ago. I opened a Roth IRA and have fully funded it every year. I contribute 5% of my check to a 403(b) that is matched at 10%. I had no credit card debt. I have an emergency fund (HYSA). Car is paid for. Small amount left on a 15 year fixed house loan at around 3%. I put $8,400 into a "catch up" Roth 403(b) a year.    Seven years ago I had some money to invest that I could afford to lose, so I put it in APPL. This is now roughly 45% of my portfolio. This is too high and no longer in the realm of money I can afford to lose.    I was thinking of selling some of the AAPL each year to finish out the Roth 403(b). I'm in my 50s so can contribute up to $30k a year. I make ~$70k a year.    It would literally take me like ten or eleven years to sell all of my AAPL stock at this rate, but it seems like a great way to reduce my taxable income and to lock in some long term gains.    I know the money I put into the Roth 403(b) will be locked up, but that seems fine by me.  What am I missing?,;,; 2024-01-08 18:01:56]
[Could/Should I use zero cost online brokerages to create a DIY custom index fund?,;,; Background: I have \~$60K in a Roth IRA that's invested in a basic weighted S&amp;P 500 fund. My regular 401K is also invested in basic index funds, and I'd like to do something different with the Roth. I have two philosophical issues with standard index funds.   First, because they are weighted to market cap, a relatively small handful of stocks make up most of the index (The top 10 companies make up 30%).  I don't care how big Apple is, or their historical gains, I don't want a single stock composing 7% of my investments.  Secondly, I have moral/ethical concerns with a few of the large companies (who doesn't?), and I don't want my money going to buy their stock, even indirectly through a large index fund. I don't sleep well knowing I might profit from companies doing things that I believe are immoral and/or deeply irresponsible.  Problem: Anything other than a standard weight index fund will have large management fees. Even a 0.5% management fee will take a sizable cut from profits over 20-30 years.  So if it costs $0 to trade, could I just use an online broker to manually buy 100s of stocks, as long as I can buy fractional amounts?  Even if I rebalance once or twice a year, it could be thousands of trades. But it's a Roth IRA, so I don't have to worry about tracking gains/losses for tax purposes. Other than being a time-consuming process that might drive me crazy, are there any other potential downsides?,;,; 2023-09-27 18:19:24]

[Rollover IRA - Continue investing in Target Date 2055 Fund (Vanguard) or purchase a Managed Fund (Fidelity Contrafund),;,; Just changed employers and the new employer does not offer a 401k. I am rolling over my current vested 401k balance to a Rollover IRA w/ Fidelity, where I already have my personal brokerage accounts.  At the previous employer, my 401k was invested in Vanguards Target 2055 Retirement Fund. With the Rollover IRA @ Fidelity, I have the option to continue to invest in this fund. But I would like to explore other options, such as Fidelity Contrafund, at this time.  I'm familiar with Contrafund as I'm invested in it now through my standard brokerage account and have been for about 7-8 years, and am happy with its performance.  For context, I'm 35 years old and am not spooked by market fluctuations - this is a long term hold and as I move closer to retirement, I will diversify into "safer" investments that are less adverse to a down market.  When comparing the 2 funds, the "Hypothetical 10 year growth of $10,000", as displayed by Fidelity's comparison tool, shows Contrafund outperforming Vanguard 2055 in a way that cannot be ignored - Roughly 30k final fund growth for Contrafund, compared to \~20k final fund growth for Vanguard 2055.  TLDR: If I'm looking for more aggressive growth over the next 10-15 years, would it make sense to invest my 401k funds within my new Rollover IRA account in Fidelity Contrafund instead of continuing with Vanguard 2055 Retirement Fund, and diversify down the road?,;,; 2023-12-07 20:56:31]
[US-only portfolio safe or not in next 10 years?,;,; Investing in US market has been a guaranteed win for the past 50 years or so, as long as you put money in every month for 20 years.

Also I see news about social problems everywhere (mass Walmart looting, increasingly frequent shooting, rising sea level = goodbye Florida, California water shortage =  mass unrest in 20 years, etc).  **Is it normal to assume the US will always win and we'll fix all those problems later?** Currently I don't see anywhere more stable than US markets; Europe has dying population problem + too strict laws = little innovation (which end-user tech products have you been using that come from Europe?), so I'd rather select manually a few stocks there instead of buying broad-market ETFs. Other international markets are kinda sketchy (rip $BABA), and subject to geopolitical changes.  But I can't say the US economy is currently safe. **Its debt is insane and will only keep increasing**. If the government keep (practically) printing money, it's possible it won't be the global currency anymore because "why does the US get to control the entire world's money"? The USD has been the global reserve currency for many generations, so I can't imagine what effects it might have.  **So, is it worth it for young people (let's say globally, since everyone has access to international stock brokers now) to diversify internationally?** Or should people should stick to a safe US-only portfolio\* ?  \----------------------  \*portfolio: 35% SPY, 35% SCHD (dividend ETF), 20% savings account or related (4% on Apple Pay, 5.5% 6-month T-bill), 10% others.

Inmode has the **highest** gross margins in the industry (83-84%).  **Insider ownership**  Insiders sold a big stake in their holdings in 2021 when the price of the stock in the market was high. They own about 8% at the moment (down from 35% in the past)  **MOAT**  After a thorough analysis, I concluded that Inmode has a **narrow MOAT** meaning they have a competitive advantage in **manufacturing** (by outsourcing it which makes their business capital-light compared to competitors). Their only other competitive advantage is **distribution**. They sell to 92 countries at the moment. Each country has its own regulations (FDA) and hoops to jump through before being able to sell.  **Capital allocation strategy**  Inmode boasts a **very high historical return on invested capital** (200%) and incremental invested capital. They have earned well above their cost of capital. They are piling up cash and have an employee incentive program that is dilutive. In 2022, for the first time, they **bought back shares** to offset this dilution.

China has already maxxed out its one advantage. High population. With 1 billion people, even marginal increases in per-capita productivity can yield huge results. However, they're slowing down in this regard, and as the % difference in population between the U.S and China shrinks, the U.S's relative position will only strengthen.

[My Willy-Nilly Stock Portfolio,;,; Hey, guess what! I'm beating the market YTD!  My make-believe portfolio is up 12.2% vs. 11.8% for VOO, a whopping 0.4% advantage.  The portfolio holds 38 company stocks. The thing is, I picked the stocks more or less at random ‚Äî just companies that I've heard of and "seemed" like they might do well going forward. No analysis, no research, no balance sheets or company reports, more like "selective dart throwing".  I think the returns are purely the product of luck and realize that my lead over VOO could evaporate at any time. We'll see. It kind of proves Peter Lynch's belief that any moax can beat the market but with a caveat: ***if you're lucky***.

[Explanation for huge FCF differences between analyst expectations and actual?,;,; Hey everyone -  Yesterday morning I read that Boeing‚Äôs Q2 2023 free cash flow results were way way ahead of analyst expectations. Analysts estimated somewhere around $175 million - and Boeings actual FCF was reported at over $2 *billion*  I know that estimates are just that - estimates. But the difference between a billion and a million is a *lot* of money - not to mention 2 billion.  Does this mean that something increased the demand for one of their products in between Q1 and Q2? If so wouldn‚Äôt they be hyping that news ahead of time?  Does this mean that they just reduced expenses by 2 billion in between quarters? That seems like a lot of expenses.  Sorry if this is an elementary question but I‚Äôd love to hear some ways in which the actual free cash flow number can be so wildly off the predicted mark.,;,; 2023-07-27 16:21:54]
[Roth IRA vs Taxable Account Holdings,;,; I currently have a Roth IRA and a taxable investment account with Merrill Lynch, and I‚Äôm planning to begin to manage these myself. The advisory fee of 1% feels too high to justify continuing with them, and it looks like all my current holdings in both accounts can be transferred to self-directed accounts without needing to sell any current holdings.  I am 32 years old and max out my Roth every year. This taxable account is not needed in any close timeframe and I have another taxable account that I contribute to regularly. I also have a chunk of money sitting in a HYSA for a down payment on a house which I‚Äôm almost certainly no longer going to be able to afford (unrelated, but unfortunate).   My question is this: is the most sensible thing to just keep the current holdings (they‚Äôre almost all just ETFs like VUG, VTV, IEFA, and IEMG anyway) and go 100% VT in both of these accounts moving forward? I will continue maxing the Roth yearly and I may contribute more to the taxable intermittently. At 32 I‚Äôm not really concerned with bond allocation, but I do want to maintain international exposure. I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs any sense in a different strategy for the Roth vs the taxable since it‚Äôs tax efficient. I‚Äôm sure there will be in the future, but at 32 I‚Äôm wondering it keeping it super simple in both accounts is best. Please let me know your thoughts; any help is appreciated!,;,; 2023-11-15 23:57:37]
[One common mistake of a novice trader,;,; Let's imagine the mindset of beginners. Beginners want to earn quickly, a lot and with minimal effort. And most likely, we know from our experience, they will be quite fearful. So they will choose those instruments that are well-known and have a good reputation. These will probably be stocks of companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple.  **How will beginners add companies to their portfolio?**   Let's specify that the stocks of these companies are not cheap and cost 100-300 dollars. Of course beginners want to fill their portfolio on enthusiasm right now. This means our trader will go to the stock exchange and simply buy them.   **What is wrong with that?**   The point is that you should buy shares of even the seemingly coolest and most famous companies not at any moment of time when you want to, but look at whether it is a good time to enter a position.   **What does good or bad timing mean?**   In investing for 10-15 years the concepts of good and bad time lose their relevance. Because for such a long period of time stocks can fall and rise 100 times.  But if we speak about from 1 to 6 months trading, it is very important to choose the right moment. Because you need to earn money rather quickly and you want to earn more, of course.   For the sake of simplicity let's consider 2 companies: META and AAPL.    Both of them have a beautiful growing chart for the last year of trading, but you should not buy both companies now, if you take them for a short term.   The fact is that META and AAPL stocks are at their all-time highs right now. They have rallied strongly over the past couple months and there will soon be a period when the price will be corrected. Since there is no one chart in the market that is a forever rising straight line. There will always come moments of correction. And if you buy their stocks now, you are very likely to buy at the most expensive price in recent times.   That's why it's important to learn how to analyze charts and choose the moments to buy or sell smartly.,;,; 2024-01-25 18:36:53]
[Looking for some semiconductor sources,;,; Hi  I'm trying to find a reliable source  exclusive to the semiconductor industry that compares each player in the field.   I have a pretty good idea of what companies exists and the market cap etc etc but what I'm lacking is being up to date with each company project pipeline. And its time consuming going through each and every one of them.  Is there any news analysis source that would be able to do a comparison between them ? I'm not interested in the technicals but more like an overview.

I have a $30k position in TSLA, so that‚Äôs most of it.   I‚Äôm thinking about taking the $40k I get from my losses and putting it in a HYSA, but not sure that would be the best thing to do. I think it would certainly be much less stressful than investing over $100k myself, but I also don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll need the money very soon.   I‚Äôm single and currently live in Denver (I hate it here), and would love to be able to go to a warmer place, potentially San Diego if I can afford it. I don‚Äôt know much about buying a house nor do I feel confident enough in a city to buy one, so still renting for now. My rent is 2.3k here, and would be much higher in a place like SD. I‚Äôm hoping to get a decent raise soon that would be closer to $200k, but not sure if it‚Äôs gonna play out yet or not.   Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Please be gentle because I know ARK was a mistake and I‚Äôm trying to do the right things now. I‚Äôm trying to get out of the mindset of recovering my losses through investments, and would like to be able to live more peacefully and not check the market every day.   Thank you!,;,; 2023-09-22 04:49:49]
[Buffett's advice for investing during inflation,;,; I've been re-reading the Berkshire annual letters recently, specifically the ones during the late '70s and early '80s when US inflation raged at 10-14%. During this time Buffett talked extensively about investing in an inflationary environment and I'd like to share three tenets that I picked out.  # Inflation tenet 1: Pricing power  In the 1980 letter, Buffett talks about how the best businesses to own are ones that have true pricing power. He calls these businesses "indexed" to inflation because they can raise the prices of their goods and services in line with the costs of producing them **without impacting consumer demand or impacting its margins**:  "For capital to be truly indexed, return on equity must rise,  i.e., business earnings consistently must increase in proportion  to the increase in the price level *without any need for the  business to add to capital - including working capital -  employed."*  The best way to increase earnings without increasing capital employed is to raise prices, but this requires pricing power. A business can achieve pricing power is by having a durable, intrinsic competitive advantage, or a 'moat' in Buffett speak. Moats come in many forms, for example brands like Apple or Coca Cola, a 'switching moat' like Automatic Data Processing, or scaling efficiencies like Costco.  # Inflation tenet 2: High returns on equity  Inflation should be considered a 'hurdle rate' which all businesses must surpass in the form of return on equity. This bar has been set incredibly low in the last couple of decades it has allowed many businesses to survive that perhaps should not have. Here is Buffett's chilling analogy from the 1981 letter:  "...inflation acts as a gigantic corporate tapeworm.  That  tapeworm pre-emptively consumes its requisite daily diet of  investment dollars regardless of the health of the host organism.   Whatever the level of reported profits (even if nil), more  dollars for receivables, inventory and fixed assets are  continuously required by the business in order to merely match  the unit volume of the previous year.  The less prosperous the  enterprise, the greater the proportion of available sustenance  claimed by the tapeworm."  "Under present conditions, a business earning 8% or 10% on  equity often has no leftovers for expansion, debt reduction or  ‚Äúreal‚Äù dividends.  The tapeworm of inflation simply cleans the  plate."  Investors would also do well to avoid companies with high debt with have the illusionary effect of juicing ROE numbers. Companies that rely on revolving credit are at the whim of rising interest rates.  # Inflation tenet 3: Capable of large business volume increases  Again in the 1981 letter, Buffett recommends that the business needs to be able to "accommodate large dollar volume increases in business (often  produced more by inflation than by real growth)  with only minor  additional investment of capital".  When businesses can increase output without increasing the cost of output at the same rate, this is called operational leverage. Examples of businesses that can more easily scale up demand are software businesses like Microsoft, or payment processors like Visa.  # Summary  Some businesses have intrinsic characteristics that make them more resilient to inflationary pressures. Investors would do well to identify some businesses that fit the profiles that Buffett has drawn us and try and own them (at a sensible price), for what may well be a sustained high inflation environment in the decade to come.,;,; 2023-03-12 20:02:55]
[Rebalancing portfolio for growth and being tax savvy - is this a good plan?,;,; My fiduciary is proposing rebalancing my portfolio which was inherited and currently focused on wealth maintenance rather than growth, but I‚Äôm not experienced and have no clue if what is being suggested makes sense. I‚Äôm 43 yr old, will have a pension upon retirement, have around $250,000 in high yield savings, my home is paid, no debt except for around 23k in student loans with low interest. Wife has around 160k in a 401k.  Main goals for this portfolio are retirement income and I would like to be tax smart:  -BrandywineGLOBAL Corporate Credit BCGIX MF 15% -Vanguard Total Bond Market BND ETF 15% -Vanguard Value VTV ETF 15% -Apple AAPL Stock 14% -Berkshire Hathaway BRKB Stock 10% -Vanguard Health Care VHT ETF 10% -Vanguard S&amp;P 500 VOO ETF 10% -Vanguard Total World Market VTV ETF 5% -Vanguard Utilities VPU ETF 5% -Fidelity Government Capital Reserves FZAXX MF 1%  While the portfolio allocation propsed above has historically generated near or above stock market level performance while taking significantly less risk (which is a good thing), one of my concerns for your account is to reposition the assets to a more tax-efficient allocation.  One of the ways to achieve this is in a taxable account using ETF‚Äôs for stock-oriented investments as opposed to mutual funds.  Mutual funds are required to pay out to shareholders and capital gain distributions from mutual funds which result in a taxable event.  Over the past two years your  account has generated taxable capital gain distributions of $8,000- $10,000 annually.  ETFs and individual stocks do not have to follow the same tax rules that apply to mutual funds, and therefore instead of paying out capital gain distributions to shareholders, they take the gains generated by the sale of stocks and just purchase more stocks.  Since the capital gain distribution is not paid out to you the result is avoidance of taxation.       The value of a couple stock oriented investments in your account have increased in value so if we were to sell the shares of those investments to rebalance  it would result in a capital gain of approximately $11,000¬± for 2023 taxes, but then going forward we no longer have those annual tax burdens.  Does the above sound ok? Or what should I be asking him?  I am trying to learn about investing instead of relying on Reddit but it‚Äôs a slow process so I appreciate this forum.  Thanks!,;,; 2023-08-05 19:55:18]
[NVIDIA - 2023 Q4 earnings projections,;,; [The new 2023 Q3 figures come from a market analysis firm named Omdia (via Tom's Hardware)](  *Meta and Microsoft, each purchasing 150,000 GPUs. Those two companies were responsible for 300,000 units, with the other 200,000 going to the rest: Oracle, Tencent, Google, and Amazon, Tesla, TickTok, Baidu, Alibaba.*     ***Q3 reported revenue was 18 bills. The reported 500k number seems to be true.***       **Now the question is, who will be ordering another 500k batch in Q4? so that at least the Q4 result won't pale in comparison and won't be a disappointment for investors?**     META to the rescue (Hopefully)! As Zuckerberg stated:  [*‚ÄúBy the end of this year, we‚Äôre going to have around 350,000 Nvidia H100s. Or around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute if you include other GPUs.‚Äù*](   , which means they might order another 200k from Nvidia, or he may *"find 2\*x H100 equivalent to compute"* to avoid paying a premium over generally specialized Nvidia GPUs and buy more specialized and power-to-output optimized ASICs chips like Google's TPUs.       I don't think other big tech (Microsoft, OpenAI, and AWS) giants will order more GPUs because running a general-purpose GPU is very expensive: [Running ChatGPT is very expensive for the company. Each query costs roughly 4 cents, according to an analysis from Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.](   Google already has its own ASICs chips called TPU.    Apple also has an edge with its M3 chips family. If their name is not on the Nvidia order line list yet, then they are certainly cooking some big updates to their M chip family.      Everyone has shown with their dollar that they aren't willing to pay a high NVIDIA premium in the long run.  And want to diversify to other chip makers, like AMD, Intel, and specialized ARM makers.     Small businesses experiment and run their AI models using rented Amazon, Microsoft, and Google cloud capacities (mostly Google because of their TPU's low power-to-cost ratio).      The rest of the market is peanuts to make any dent.      **\[Conclusions\]:** Their a moderate-low probability Q4 revenues will reach a plateau of around 15-20 billion.  A moderate probability that they will be below 15 billion. A low probability of exceeding 20 billion.  &amp;#x200B;  ***Let's sidestep to AI marker TAM topic,***        [*Meanwhile, looking forward to 2027, the server market's value is estimated at a staggering $195.6 billion.*](   However, this estimated revenue will be brought by those who rent AI processing capacities like AWS, GCP, and Azure cloud providers. And not ChatGPT clones. The market has not figured yet the TAM (total addressable market) of services like ChatGPT.       However, I try to speculate on [open numbers]( which have stagnated for the last 6 months.      100 million monthly active users \* 10$ per subscription produces 1 billion in revenue.    [The average cost of 1 query from a used is 4 cents](     A single user runs 2,000 queries per month on average. The query is a single text message you send to the chatbot.      2000 \* 0.04 = 80 $ to service 1 user per month.    Until the OpenAI level of efficiency improves they will be losing 70$ to service 1 user per month.    No wonder OpenAI has closed its ChatGPT Plus subscription.  It doesn't seem sustainable.     Last note,  the majority of data centers upgrade their equipment every 4-5 years. So, if AI expectations won't burst, and chip efficiency improves 10-fold, and other chip makers won't catch up, don't expect big tech to re-stock their chips earlier than the end of 2027.      &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2024-01-21 22:17:52]
[[D] The Question facing Nvidia,;,; The problem this stock faces is no one knows how to value it.  The company are investing in technology that opens up new markets (AI, Omniverse and self driving for example).  Will those markets pan out or will they go bust?  And if they do pan out, what's the value of those markets?    Nobody knows, these markets haven't been served before.  Today's share price is a reflection of the market sentiment, the voting machine's results as of this moment.   The current share price is either grossly over extended or grossly undervalued -- there is no in between in my opinion.  I believe Nvidia has cemented itself as the hardware technology leadership company of the era, much like IBM and Intel of past decades.   Some on Wall St understand this, others are coming to understand it.  But there are many who doubt that is the case as well.  The most obvious question from doubters is about competition:  Won't AMD or Intel or Google or Apple just come in with better technology and take their position?  I've been invested in this company for more than 15 years and what they do uniquely are two things:  1.  Strategize and 2.  Execute.   They have been building a GPGPU platform (General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit), otherwise known as "accelerated computing" since about 2007.   It's different from standard CPUs in that it processes massive amounts of data in parallel, tens of thousands of "cores" operating at the same time.  Their platform is a combination of inter-generational compatible hardware and software.  The platform is robust, reliable, well supported, offers regular performance improvements, and is now ubiquitous with over 4million developers using it including nearly every AI developer on the planet.  So when a competitor comes to throw their hat in the ring, there is an enormous defensive position to overcome that includes a large user base who are getting reliable, quantifiable and predictable results.    Since 2014 predictions of Nvidia's demise in the data center have been constant from both mammoth technology companies (AMD, Intel, Google, Baidu) and startups alike.    But no one has been able to make a real dent in Nvidia's momentum and share -- not with CPUs, ASICs, FPGAs or any other technology.  In their core area of AI model training, Nvidia has between 85-95% market share depending on whose numbers you look at.   They are serving this with the largest, most complex mass produced semiconductor devices man can imagine.  What about other GPUs?   GPUs have proven an excellent solution for the job, they are readily available, flexible and performant.  AMD and Intel are building new GPUs and pursuing as " AI is their number 1 priority."  I expect these companies to pick up some business simply because Nvidia cannot service 100% of the demand they are creating.  But these well-regarded companies have a difficult hill to climb in software.  They need to make their products work as well as Nvidia's to be competitive, if they don't they will likely sell at a deep discount.  A "real" competitive offering will have to exceed Nvidia's solution in both performance and ease of use.   I haven't seen that sort of competitor surface in the past 10 years, nor can I see one on the horizon.  There may be one lurking -- certainly a possibility -- but it will take 2-4 years minimum for that type of solution to come to market.   In the mean time, Nvidia is out re-architecting data centers with AI-centric chip solutions:  CPUs, GPUs, DPUs and networking and switching technology.  They continue to raise the bar for competitors.  Soon data center processing will be managed by AI techniques to yield better, faster, more power efficient results sooner.     Nvidia owns data center acceleration -- the nexus of AI -- for the near term.  Is AI a real technology that has launched and will add value to human kind in innumerable ways, or does it sputter and fizzle into another "AI winter" from whence Nvidia becomes a footnote in history?   That is the question on this company's share price.  FPE, PS, DCF ?  These are just irrelevant metrics in this context.,;,; 2023-05-18 17:39:57]
[CNCX Concentrix stock - Undervalued?,;,; Let me know if this looks good and any comments/upvotes will be appreciated. Feel free to ask any questions whatsoever that makes you contest my opinion or just another stock you would like me to analyze.  Unemployed and lost but want to see if I am any good with analyzing stocks. Fundamental stock analysis of decent size companies (no penny stocks or crazy tech companies); I have no idea in technical analysis. I am thinking if I am any good I could do some YouTube videos on some of the stocks most requested by the community here and help people make money. I will be using conservative numbers wherever I think it is possible.  Concentrix CNXC is a traditional CX call center service that has many clients like Apple etc. **Three of the most important factors for analyzing stocks is History, Competitors, and Outlook -- so I will be trying to put my take on it and make it short as possible.**  **Competitors:**  |As of 2022|Teleperformance TLPFY|TTEC Holdings TTEC|Majorel MAJ.AS|Concentrix CNCX| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |||||| |Revenue|8.2 bn|2.5 bn|2.1 bn|9.8 bn| |Gross Profit|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A| |Operating Margin|994 M (12.2%)|250 M (10%)|210 M (10%)|980 M (10%)| |Assets|4.4 bn|1.1 bn|1 bn|4 bn| |Liabilities|(5.2 bn)|(1.5 bn)|(1 bn)|(8 bn)| |Asset - Liabilities|(800 M)|(400 M)|0|(4 bn)| |Enterprise Value|10 bn (10 times)|2.5 bn (10 times)|2.1 bn (10 times)|9.8 bn| |Market Value|9.2 bn|2.1 bn|2.1 bn|5.8 bn| |Should be Market Price|158|44|22|115| |Actual Price|162|35|29|83| |Difference|N/A|\+25%|\-25%|\+40%|  **History:**  The biggest competitor to Concentrix is Teleperformance.

They are neck in neck with Teleperformance who acquired Majorel for 1.5 times sales to Enterprise Value - means they all feel prices are low enough for consolidation in the industry.  Looking at the first table it looks like Concentrix is undervalued by 40% on already depressed numbers of EV/Revenue as average EV/Revenue for Teleperformance has been more like 2 historically. So prices will be expected to reach $120 on just 1 times EV/Revenue.  But lets say if we give it a more reasonable number of 1.5-2 EV/Revenue then stock price will be expected to reach $160.,;,; 2023-06-28 03:34:19]
[REITs vs SP500 vs dividend delusion,;,; I always had this logic if I invest long enough into Reits I would be able to retire with dividends wiithout withdrawing.  Lots of people say once snowball begins you really feel the power of dividends.  I have another 35 years before retirement anyway and residency is UK but more and more doing calculations of profit after each year finish I realise dividends is like fake hope. For example first year my dividends payout was ¬£16.43. This year is ¬£900 range and next year projected ¬£1400 which seems good on paper but these very dividends stock could have been replaced with growth and instead of small realized gains I would of had way more unrealised gains.  But more on reits there is even research that Reits most years outperform SP500 due to the power of reinvesting dividends but after holding Vici (risk but growth) Realty Income (passive but monthly dividend and super diversified) I realised they are both very passive boring stocks both together are 15% of my portfolio.  Of course during high interest rates you wouldnt expect Reits to be exciting but I just did future conservative calculations and slightly doubt whether its even worth holding Reits. Posting here whether I missed something from my calculations that makes it so one sided  Like the way I see snowball effect is when it's growth is  exponential and I thought if for example Realty Income pays you ¬£45 per month that would be enough to buy 1 whole share right  so calculations are you need 264 shares which is ¬£11,880   Year 1  264 shares +¬£45 dividend monthly Month 1  264+45 Month 2 265+45.05 Month 3 266+45.22 Month 4 267+45.39 Month 5 268+45.56 Month 6 269+45.73 Month 7 270+45.9 Month 8 271+46.07 Month 9 272+46.24 Month 10 273 +46.41 Month 11 274 +46.58 Month 12 275 +46.75  1 year from  264 shares =11,880  To 11,880 +3% annual growth =12,236 +reinvested shares 11 =495 =12,731 7.2% growth  But if invested in growth stock  11,880 +20% 1 year =14,256   So I thought snowball effect doesn't really happen with 11k into Reits but what if I was able to buy 4 Realty Income shares every month is that snowball effect?   ¬£57,000 = 1266 shares =¬£215.22 per month gives you 4.7 shares at current price  Year 1 1266 shares +¬£215 dividend monthly Month 1 1266+215 Month 2 1270.7+216 Month 3 1275.5+216.8 Month 4 1280.3+217.6 Month 5 1285.1+218.4 Month 6 1289.9+219.2 Month 7 1294.7+220.1 Month 8 1299.59+220.93 Month 9 1304.4+221.7 Month 10 1309.3+222.5 Month 11 1314.2+223.4 Month 12 1319.1+224.2  After year 1 57000 1266 shares To 57000+3% annual growth =58,710 +53 shares reinvested ¬£2385 61095 7.2% growth  If invested in VUSA 10% annual growth 57000+10% =62700 Plus dividends ¬£772 per year 63,475 11.5% growth  Only reason I chose Realty Income is because it's extremely safe stable diversified stock pays 5% but even with 60k invested I still don't see snowball effect of course everyone says just put it into VUSA and forget but dividend investors talk about how they can outperform sp500 but I don't see whether its even worth trying   Maybe in your last 5 years employed you start exchanging your growth stocks and ETFs for Reits for passive Income but slowly I realized recently, investing into passive dividend stocks while young is a big waste of time and illusion to provide passive Income that isn't there. You can compare year 1 dividends received to current year and say wow snowball effect is real but when you take into consideration on how much growth you missed out. Makes me feel my investing strategy has been used 30 years too early   Even when my portfolio consist of 55% Apple &amp; MSFT just mistakes like TROW DIS SOFI my portfolio every year for 5 years is 3-7% lower than VUSA. Even though stock picking is fun but it really is true VUSA seems the only hassle-stress free strategy.

[First-time Poster (go easy),;,; TLDR: Swapping from Edward Jones to Schwab and looking for traditional IRA and other recommendations. \*Apologies for the following novel!      Hey folks, I am looking for some strategic advice. I started investing three years ago when I finished active-duty military service. My wife and I stupidly didn‚Äôt save or invest any money during my 20 years of service, so no IRAs or TSP starting off. We collectively were living paycheck-to-paycheck during my military service based on terrible spending habits.      In 2021 we sold a house which netted us around $150k. We bought another (at 2.499 interest) but put very little down because we used our VA loan and I wanted to feel the security of having cash on hand. We have kept the rest of the proceeds in the breakdown below. Not really knowing what I was doing, I opened accounts with Edward Jones and started throwing money at it. We were able to open the Roth's based on my income then, but have since become ineligible to add to those due to high income. Also, we bought all of the individual stocks and watched them plummet in 2022, but they have since recovered and we are basically back where we started.      Fast-forward to now, we still spend what I consider a ridiculous amount of money every month, but we are working to correct it and double-down on investing for retirement. I started working with a great company that does a 5% match with John Hancock, and I am maxing that contribution every year (about $20k) with 75% into RFHTX and 25% into the 500 Index Fund. I am not looking to change that allocation unless folks have a compelling recommendation. Additionally, we have roughly $5k/month that is unused (saved) and put in our normal bank savings account which is really giving us no return, about 60 dollars a month, so not really sure what to do there‚Ä¶ I should note that I plan to work for at least the next 15-20 years and expect my current income level to remain static or increase.      So my questions are:     \-	As we are moving into Schwab, what index funds or ETFs would make the most sense for the Roth IRAs?    \-	Should we be maxing out Traditional IRAs with the intent to do a backdoor conversion later?     \-	What should be done with the cash that we have in our bank‚Äôs low-interest savings account?    \-	Are we on track or do I need to make some drastic move like taking savings and paying off vehicles / dropping the savings into my mortgage to reduce it / other?        One thought I have is to make the transition to Schwab and put the Roth‚Äôs/529s into whatever the advisor recommends. Then liquidating the $50,000 in individual stocks from EJ, put that money into a MMF with Schwab and use that money to fund Traditional IRAs for my wife and I. Would this be a smart move?        Below are some of our financial stats:    Age: 44 ‚Äì seeking to retire between 60-65 y.o.    Current take home (net) income: $20,000/mo    \-	$12,000 from employment    \-	$8,000 from military retirement &amp; VA disability    Monthly bills: $10,000/month    Discretionary spending: $5,000/mo    Current 401k: $88,000    (Edward Jones) Existing Roth IRAs: $20,000    USAA Savings account: $90,000    (Edward Jones) Kid‚Äôs 529s: $8,000 (although both kids have GI Bill, so won‚Äôt likely ‚Äúneed‚Äù the 529s)    (Edward Jones) Individual stock positions: $50,000    \-	Alphabet (100 shares)    \-	Amazon (60)    \-	Apple (50)    \-	Blackrock (5)    \-	Duke Energy (10)    \-	Meta (20)    \-	Microsoft (10)    \-	Southwest (100)    \-	Disney (20)    ,;,; 2023-07-29 17:02:26]

[What allocation approach is implied by Toby Nangle's new FT article on narrow markets driving equity returns?,;,; What I take from the article below is not to rely too much on a macro-driven asset allocation strategy.  But what asset allocation strategy makes sense in this environment then?    &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;    /content/c5d7ee71-92a2-4840-9344-2f62e9642e61  # Narrow markets should humble macro forecasters  5-6 minutes   2023-08-08   Toby Nangle    The writer is a former global head of asset allocation at a fund manager   This year has been marked by strong equity markets, and what looks to be an astonishingly narrow rally. Of the 16.9 per cent returned by the S&amp;P 500 index in the first half of this year, 12.9 per cent derived from the performance of only 10 companies.   With such a high proportion of a market‚Äôs value created by so few groups, it feels fair to question the tool kits of asset allocators and, more broadly, the product line-up of fund management firms.   Narrow stock market returns are, after all, the norm. Research by Arizona State University professor Hendrik Bessembinder shows that more than half of the $55.1tn in net wealth generated by the US equity market between 1926 and 2022 came from the performance of fewer than 0.3 per cent of the market‚Äôs stocks, with the other half of this net wealth coming from the next best 3.1 per cent of stocks.   Moreover, almost three-fifths of stocks actually destroyed wealth over the period. In quant-speak, the distribution of compound stock returns has been very positively skewed.   In addition, the skewness of equity returns turns out not to be a particularly North American phenomenon. Indeed, in the three decades ending in December 2020 the proportion of net wealth contributed by the best 1 per cent of emerging market stocks was more than 80 per cent.   Looking at the entire global stock universe outside the US, the proportion rises still further to more than 90 per cent. Winners have won big. Most individual stocks over the past 30 years have failed to outperform dollars stored under the mattress, let alone a local currency interest-bearing cash deposits ‚Äî even after taking into account dividends.   Bessembinder‚Äôs work has typically been surveyed in terms of what it means for active stockpickers ‚Äî with some seeing it as a rationalisation for chasing moonshots and others for pursuing passive index-investing. Less examined has been what it means for asset allocators.   Developed market stock index returns have been dominated by global companies ‚Äî even if they each carry a domestic tilt. As such, connecting local macroeconomic developments to the performance of a region‚Äôs equity index can be something of a dark art.   Single large stocks with an economic fate that has little to do with their listing jurisdiction have dominated national index returns. For example, the photolithography machine-maker ASML accounts for more than a fifth of the total net wealth created by Dutch stocks in the 30 years up to 2020. Global fast-fashion retailer Inditex accounts for more than a sixth of Spanish stock returns. Global luxury brands LVMH and L‚ÄôOr√©al collectively account for almost a quarter of the returns from French stocks. These are not outliers. One cannot explain long-term returns without reference to such companies in pretty much any region.   If it becomes hard to explain equity index returns without reference to specific superstar groups, it stands to reason that it must be even harder to forecast equity index returns without taking a view on some individual companies. It‚Äôs easy today to focus on whether the Magnificent Seven that have powered the S&amp;P 500 rally ‚Äî Apple, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta ‚Äî might stumble. With more than a quarter of the US market‚Äôs valuation riding on them, the question is not at all trivial. But 30 years ago, five of these seven had not even listed. It‚Äôs hard to take a view on companies that don‚Äôt yet exist.   I‚Äôve been as guilty as the next asset allocator in explaining my preference for US over European stocks or vice versa with reference to some domestic macroeconomic outlook. Given that financials, utilities and property groups will carry a strong domestic flavour, this is still forgivable.   But when constructing a long-term strategic asset allocation, it is becoming increasingly untenable to justify regional preferences with reference to local macroeconomic forecasts. This may explain why long-term return forecasts for equity markets ‚Äî or Capital Market Assumptions, as they are known ‚Äî have such a lousy record.   The biggest single investment decision any institutional or individual investor is likely to make in their portfolio is their choice of strategic asset allocation. To create a strategic asset allocation one must make reasonable guesses about future market returns. Bessembinder‚Äôs research shows quite how invariably such reasonable guesses will be blindsided by the fate of single stocks.,;,; 2023-08-08 12:11:15]

[China plans to expand its ban on iPhones, AAPL drops 3%+,;,; **China plans to expand a ban on the use of iPhones in sensitive departments** to government-backed agencies and state companies, a sign of growing challenges for Apple Inc. in its biggest foreign market and global production base.  Several agencies have begun instructing staff not to bring their iPhones to work, people familiar with the matter said, affirming a previous report from the Wall Street Journal. In addition, **Beijing intends to extend that restriction far more broadly to a plethora of state-owned enterprises and other government-controlled organizations**, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter.  If Beijing goes ahead, **the unprecedented blockade will be the culmination of a yearslong effort to root out foreign technology use** in sensitive environments, coinciding with Beijing‚Äôs effort to reduce its reliance on American software and circuitry. It **threatens to erode Apple‚Äôs position in a market that yields about a fifth of its revenue**, and from where it makes the majority of the world‚Äôs iPhones through sprawling factories that employ millions of Chinese.  Chinese state firms like oil giant PetroChina Co. employ millions and control vast swathes of a centrally planned economy. Given Apple‚Äôs relationship with Beijing and its importance to the economy, it ‚Äúhas historically been viewed as relatively safe in China from government restrictions,‚Äù KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel said in a report Wednesday. ‚ÄúIs the government changing its stance?‚Äù  A representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment. The State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission and the State Council Information Office didn‚Äôt respond to faxed requests for comment.  Source: [ 2023-09-07 13:15:44]
[AAPL price dump after VR headset reveal,;,; The price movement was directly correlated with the VR headset announcement along with the demo of features.  * Yes, it looks like ski goggles. * The OS is called **Vision Pro** * The VR OS is similar to Microsoft's Mixed Reality with their Hololens product which came out 8 years ago...  One of the **selling features** is that your eyes are visible, but the headset will conceal your eyes when you're fully immersed in an app.. which may or may not be groundbreaking as it didn't perfectly reveal your eyes (perhaps because there wasn't enough lighting inside the goggles to show your eyes clearly, but I think this could be fixed w/ software or by adding LED lights on the inside edges), however:  * If you can keep your headset on while talking to people in the room compared to the competition, this feature alone would win out  Price tag is $3500, but again this is the dev conference, so the consumer version of this product will come later, although I can see how a lot of developers might want to buy this thing (also consider that Apple has the largest developer network) compared to competitor headsets which cost 7x less (META is coming out with a $500 VR headset).  Something to note, the stock dropped nearly 1.5% during all the free features (before the VR headset) that were going to be included to existing users, however that did coincide with the market indexes dropping as well.  Total drop from the peak was around 3.5% however the stock recovered nearly a percent, today's loss is only around 0.75% after falling from making another new 52w all time high.  Trading volume was 2x the normal average, so ending red is very significant.  META &amp; MSFT stayed relatively flat compared to AAPL.  Overall I think this was bad news for the stock in the short term; buy the rumor sell the news type event.  If the VR headset was truly revolutionary, stock price would have gone much higher, **so we have to wait &amp; see what Apple developers can do with this headset for consumers &amp; what Apple's actual consumer version of the headset will be.**  Than after 12 to 18 months when the killer apps come out, re-evaluate Apple's VR headset.  FYI I own AAPL stock,;,; 2023-06-05 20:27:12]
[AAPL stock continues climb to $3T with new trading highs,;,; Apple stock (AAPL) recently bucked a year-long trend and set a new record-high closing price. Ten days later, investors are looking at a new intraday trading high as well as the highest closing price to date.        The company closed at $187.00 per share today after opening at $183.74 and reaching $187.04 during trading. That puts Apple at a $2.941 trillion valuation based on market cap.        Apple nearly became the first company to close with a $3 trillion company valuation in January 2022, but the peak high didn‚Äôt last through intraday trading. Apple would go on to lose $1 trillion in value by year‚Äôs end due to iPhone supply constraints bottlenecking sales.        And while Apple stock saw the company‚Äôs valuation hit the $3 trillion mark last year, AAPL still hasn‚Äôt closed with a $3 trillion company valuation.        Despite significant setbacks at the end of last year, it continues to look likely that Apple will close with a $3 trillion valuation in the near future. Apple is once again positioned as the most valuable company on Wall Street, with a $2.94 trillion valuation.        In terms of products, Apple is planning four new iPhones with USB-C this fall. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are gaining the Dynamic Island design introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro. 9to5Mac also has in-depth reporting on the new iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. The latter iPhone is expected to be the first with a periscope-design lens system for enhanced optical zoom.        Apple Vision Pro, the company‚Äôs all-new AR/VR product, will hit stores in the United States in early 2024. The product carries a $3,499 price tag.

[Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,;,; From [Investopedia](  "Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.  KEY TAKEAWAYS Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.  The company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.  Previously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.  The move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.  Apple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release.  The company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.  The company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.  The new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).  Apple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.  So far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.  Apple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year.  In each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.  Apple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed."  Personally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.,;,; 2023-03-28 09:45:06]

[Apple Silicon Endgame ($AAPL),;,; I'm gaming out what Apple silicone looks like 5-10 years down the line. Generally I'm a big user of Apple products but they have definitely been getting expensive recently largely from Apple's push in vertical integration of semiconductors. Each generation of M series chip has lasted 1-2 years making the rate at which Apple is improving astonishing but also means their costs are rising quickly.  It's common knowledge that semiconductors get more expensive to manufacture as their architectural complexity increases. This is understood as the cost of being at the bleeding edge of the industry and is representative through many avenues including R&amp;D. Exact numbers are difficult to grasp because  Apple has been constantly in a state of new chip development for the past 3-4 years. With the trend that generally people will be buying "big ticket" electronics like laptops and phones with less frequency moving forward, there will be a point where it is no longer viable for Apple to improve its semiconductor or has to find more sales. Regardless, at the current rate a decision point seems likely on changes for Apple silicon. In the case they want to find more sales, where does Apple expect the sales to come from? Will Apple open M chips to products outside of their lineup? Will Apple restart manufacturing of older chips?,;,; 2023-11-17 11:39:09]

AI is the future but investors need profits now, not just future potential.         This gives Apple room to impress with fundamentals, even if they're behind in AI.

I'm debating selling them now or waiting a little bit more for them to hopefully pump up, but I know that can go the other way too.   I know nobody is psychic. I'm not asking for a crystal ball.

[Review my AAPL stock prediction from 2022,;,; Was I right in 2022? AAPL just touched a record $184.95. I argued that AAPL's changes that came during the pandemic would prevent it from collapsing back to pre-pandemic price points like most other stocks.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  [**Original post**](  **tldr:** Pandemic stocks had no fundamental changes to their services and products in the last 2 years. AAPL had some substantial changes that came during the pandemic.  It makes a lot of sense that a lot of companies are normalizing back to pre-pandemic values because people are slowly easing back to normal life. This has led to crashes of 20-80% for many companies.  AAPL is still up \~100% since the pandemic. What are the reasons why AAPL won't drop back down too?  Here are my 6 reasons:  **People severely underestimated how much impact the Trump administration destroying Huawei phones had on Apple.** Apple benefited hugely as people bought iPhones instead of Huawei. In China, Apple is now the #1 smartphone maker again. Two years ago, I would have said this is impossible because of how strong Chinese phone makers have been and have been growing. In hindsight, the moment Trump announced the ban was the moment AAPL should have exploded.  **5G super-cycle** came during the pandemic  **Superior supply-chain management during the pandemic allowed Apple to gain permanent market shares.** In the US, the iPhone has surpassed Android in marketshare and is accelerating, which I thought would never happen again.  **Mac transitioned to Apple Silicon during the pandemic,** which is beating the pants off Intel and AMD chips in performance and performance per watt. Apple is now the fastest-growing computer maker and they're just getting started. The PC market is $150b/year, and Apple only has an 8% market share. If Apple is able to go up to 20 to 30%, that's a very respectable increase in revenue.  **Apple is expected to eventually enter some of the hottest markets during the pandemic** which were electric vehicles, self-driving cars, and the metaverse. While existing companies in those markets have dropped off, Apple hasn't even released a product for them yet. This means AAPL never actually caught the hype for these categories during the pandemic.  **Investors never really caught onto Apple's new strategy until recently which involves gaining market share and selling services.** Apple is no longer just serving the premium markets. The old saying "Apple products are overpriced" is no longer true. For $330, you can buy a new iPad. $250 and get the iPhone SE. $400 and get an iPhone SE. And I'm guessing Apple is planning a cheap Macbook SE to take PC market share too. These are excellent value products and serve as the entry points into Apple's iron grip ecosystem. Once you're in with one product, you can't get out. Next thing you know, you're buying Airpods every 2 years, subscribing to Apple Music, getting Apple Fitness+, upgrading to a Macbook Pro, using Apple Pay which gives Apple a % of the transaction, buying virtual items in stupid mobile games, etc...,;,; 2023-06-09 11:06:42]
[Has "investing early" in a company changed (gotten harder?) over the last few decades?,;,; Everyone wishes they invested in AAPL or GOOGL (sorry if those are bad examples) at IPO, but it seems like the nature of an IPO has changed in my brief time watching the market, and I'm wondering if anyone can either support or refute my theory. IPOs these days seem to be much bigger promoted events now, with higher prices for shares, meaning that "getting in early" is much less accessible than it once was.  Add in all the ways day trading has evolved over a generation, and it just seems like a different world.  The idea of "had I invested $10 in AAPL when I was young I would be a millionaire!" seems impossible now, but its very possible my lack of breadth on this topic is making me misunderstand the situation.   Apologies if this is the wrong sub, or if this question is just blatantly moronic.   Thanks.,;,; 2023-03-04 03:58:08]
[Apple (AAPL): A Critical Perspective on Their Financial Performance and AI Development,;,; Apple's recent financial performance and position in the AI industry have raised some red flags. Despite generating significant revenue, Apple's gross margin percentage has seen a decline, and its heavy spending on share buybacks might suggest a lack of better investment opportunities.   Additionally, while Apple has been investing in AI, they seem to be falling behind. Their acquisitions in the field haven't yet translated into significant progress, which may suggest difficulties in integrating these acquisitions or a lack of strategic focus.   It's crucial for us to keep a critical eye on these developments. What are your thoughts,;,; 2023-05-24 18:50:03]

[Apple stock closes at an all-time-high, added $1 trillion to its market cap in 2023,;,; Apple (AAPL) achieved a new record high yesterday, closing at $197.96, up 1.67% for the day.         The company consistently outperforms its peers and is one of only five US companies valued at over $1 trillion. Notably, on December 6, 2023, Apple surpassed a $3 trillion total market valuation.         Throughout 2023, Apple increased its market cap by $1 trillion, reaching a total valuation of $4 trillion expected in 2024 if the pace continues.         Other companies with over $1 trillion valuations include Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia. The gap between Apple and Microsoft is around $220 billion.         While these figures are interesting to observe, they don't mean much unless you're a stockholder. Apple's market cap is likely to reach $4 trillion in 2024 if its pace doesn't slow down, and with Apple Vision Pro on the horizon, anything is possible    ,;,; 2023-12-14 11:35:56]

[The Future of Apple: Time for a Reality Check or a Steady Hold?,;,; The tech community is buzzing with opinions about Apple‚Äôs latest release, the iPhone 15, and it's clear that the reception has been more tepid than previous iterations. As long-time Apple investors, we've enjoyed the highs of groundbreaking releases, but is it time for a reality check? Is AAPL overpriced, or are we merely on the cusp of another wave of innovation that will take the stock to new heights?  ## Mild Reception for iPhone 15  Even the most avid iPhone users appear somewhat unimpressed with the latest features. The question that looms is whether Apple has reached a plateau in terms of smartphone innovation. After all, how much better can a phone camera get? Is faster processing power enough to justify upgrading?  ## AAPL Stock in Rough Waters  The stock has been wobbly, and many are wondering if a market correction is overdue. The high valuation of AAPL stock might seem unwarranted based on current product releases. So, should investors cut and run or stick around for the next big thing?  ## Hidden Potential: Siri and LLm  While it's easy to focus on tangible products, let's not forget Apple's potential in software and services. Rumors of significant Siri improvements and the much-talked-about LLm feature could turn the tide for the tech giant. We've seen how software services like Apple Music and the App Store have become significant revenue streams; could a next-gen Siri do the same?  ## Never Rule Out Innovation  Apple has always been a frontrunner in technology. Whether it's introducing the first iPhone or changing the way we listen to music with the iPod, Apple has continually set new industry standards. As investors, perhaps what we need is not skepticism but patience.   So, to my tech industry peers and fellow Apple stockholders, I'm eager to hear your thoughts.

[Are we supposed to ignore cumulative inflation? Prices have gone up 18%+ on average in 3 years. bullish for economy and stocks, right?,;,; People like to focus on YoY inflation compared to previous year, ignoring 2-3 years ago.  Things went from relatively stable 2-3% yoy inflation prior to covid, to a quick jump during 2021-2023.  So cpi July 2021 was 5% over July 2020, July '22 was 9% over 2021. July '23 will be 3% over 2022.  cumulative inflation is way up. After a slow steady price increase from 2010-2020, we got a big spike during 2021-2023, and now we resume a slow steady increase from here forward.  doing the math, total inflation is \~18%+ in 3 years since 2020. That's roughly 6-9 years worth of inflation pulled forward.  So what now? Looks like consumers are not consuming less; they are accepting the higher prices.  Now we just wait for wages to hurry up and go up 18% so consumers can pay off their credit card debt? iphone prices will never fall back down, so that means AAPL will reach $300 quicker.

For those who don't know the Magnificent 7 are: **AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META, TSLA, NVDA.** With a combined market cap of **more than $11 trillion**, they currently make up approx. **29% of the S&amp;P 500's market cap.**   The 7 giants have gained **71%** so far this year while the rest of the 493 stocks included in the benchmark index have gained 6%. They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets.   Most analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least.

Maybe even swap META &amp; TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE.  Should we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world? Should we consider cyclicality? There's no doubt that all 7 of these companies are leaders and are probably not going anywhere in the near future.

[Which company are you willing to buy its shares but never their products/services?,;,; I am curious if you all have such cases. I've learned over the years that it's easier to invest in companies whose products/services I use but it's not really the best strategy as personal biases apply (ex: I use ASOS a lot for my clothes but their share has been getting hammered since the post-pandemic peak).  So, I've decided to actually search for solid companies to buy, even if I don't buy their products. Two quick examples of mine:  1. AAPL: Probably the most well-run company in recent years. I never owned a single Apple product, as I've always considered them overpriced and my stubborn-ass being fixated on android phones and microsoft products. But I cannot dispute how well the company is ran and able to secure a loyal customer line and solid profit margins year after year.  2. TSLA: Personally, I don't ever plan on buying a Tesla car and I also don't really like Elon as a person. But I still have to acknowledge some of the advantages that Tesla has as a company, especially their data collecting systems. I think Tesla has a great future and even if I'm not a fan of Elon, I can still put my biases aside and realize that there's ton of experienced investors who trust him. He has a great track record of building companies so that's a risk I'm willing to take (TSLA is like 3-4% of my portfolio)  Do you have any similar examples?,;,; 2023-05-29 14:12:18]
["Markets don't peak on pessimism. They peak on optimism",;,; There's this saying.  Does the market seem overly optimistic to you?  AAPL surely seems super optimistic. Analysts project it to have a linear path straight to $240.  More and more people are expecting new market all time highs this year. Bears have capitulated and are chasing the long direction.  Any lingering pessimism is bullish, according to this saying.   Is there anything else to be pessimistic about anymore?,;,; 2023-07-03 04:55:02]

[What is the future for Berkshire Hathaway after Buffett departs this world?,;,; First off, I'm a relatively novice investor, having only started in the process during the pandemic, and while I did get my initial interest from some of the hype stocks when starting, I quickly realized I did not know enough about what I was doing with my money, so I've been trying to learn as much as possible to make wiser decisions.  I'm 42, most of my investments are in ETFs, with a little AAPL, GLW, WCC and LEVI.  I also have a small chunk i've been building on in BRK.A and I am realizing that I know little about what would happen if Warren were to pass away (or become no longer capable of running things).  What would happen under those circumstances?  Would it go to his kids?  Does Munger take over?  ,;,; 2023-10-14 16:24:23]

I don‚Äôt expect them to crash or anything, but hitting new highs just doesn‚Äôt feel right to me lol.  Anyway, I guess i‚Äôll keep DCA into things. Just wanted to rant.,;,; 2023-11-17 13:16:16]

[Sell stocks and take profit or hold through up and down waves?,;,; Wondering how investors handle their longer term held stocks.  Do you sell occasionally and take profits if you feel the market is going to take a downturn or do you just hold through the waves.  I have a lot of aapl and several other stocks and I‚Äôm thinking of selling a few hundred of each and re-purchasing during a dip.   I own appl at $70 (I sell CCs and puts to reduce my cost basis).  When aapl has dipped to $120-$130 I tell myself I should have sold at $170 ‚Ä¶taken profits and rebought.  Since this sell will be long term capital gains the tax won‚Äôt be a big deal so not worried.   Am I the only investor that holds through the up and downs? Should I sell some and rebuy?  Thank you in advance.,;,; 2023-04-27 01:13:55]

[43 years old and I just invested in stocks for the first time in my life,;,; Hi everyone!  I decided to post here because I'm anxious, scared, and excited at the same time because I finally saved up some money and invested it for the first time.  I quit drinking beer and buying useless crap, and saved up (don't laugh) $1,000 dollars and had it sitting there in a credit union with pennies for interest and I didn't like that.    I'm really kicking myself for not doing this when I was younger.  I remember when I was in my mid 20's "this close" to making a brokerage account and getting started, and I never did it.  Did this scare any of you the first time you got in to trading?    The first share I bought was 1 full share in the Vanguard VGT ETF.  I know it sounds dumb, but it was pretty scary and exciting at the same time.  My position is focusing 80% ETFs and sprinkle in some individual stocks to play around with.    My primary goal is dividends and compound reinvesting, in the hopes that I can have a nice-ish passive income 20-30 years from now.  I'm wondering what you guys think of my current positions:  **ETFs:** VGT, VONG, VTI, SCHD, and SCHG  **Stocks** *(I bought fractions of these)*:  AAPL, AMZN, HD, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, O, RTX, WM, WMT  That was my attempt of diversifying.  I have been reading until my eyes bleed, and I really have no idea if what I'm doing is considered smart or not.  But for the first time, checking my portfolio today.. seeing I'm up 1.24% with everything in green (short of stupid Wal\*Mart)...    I'm up a whopping $10!  And I think that's pretty cool!!!  Now how in the hell do I make that **bajillions**?  Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-10-06 16:53:26]

[Monthly ‚Äòwhat are your favourite stocks?‚Äô Post,;,; Trying to learn sectors/companies that others know but I don‚Äôt, and share with everyone here.  From my portfolio, I have the general big techs and a few small/mid cap companies i find interesting.  My list is: AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, MA, ENPH, SQ, UNH, ASTS, RKLB, and IONQ.  What‚Äôs yours?,;,; 2023-07-13 15:53:21]
[Stick with my "Magnificent 7" (well 5) or move to QQQ?,;,; Hey all, I retired recently at age 55 and have been pondering about my investment strategy for the coming years. Specifically, I'm caught between rebalancing my current tech-heavy portfolio, adding AAPL to the mix, or just simplifying life by moving everything into QQQ.   This particular portfolio makes up around 30% of my total retirement savings, and I plan to start drawing it down slowly in about 2 years.        My Current Portfolio      MSFT: \~75%    AMZN: \~9%    NVDA: \~8%    TSLA: \~6%    GOOG: \~1%    Some Context:    I earned my MSFT shares during my career there and am pretty bullish on their future, hence the big slice of the pie they occupy. I added the TSLA in 2016 and sold a few when it had a big gain but again I'm bullish on them. Most of the stocks have been held for at least 3 years.        So, what are your thoughts?        Should I rebalance these existing stocks?    Should I consider adding AAPL to diversify a bit within the tech sector?    Or should I just move it all into QQQ for ease of management?      Just seeking opinions.  &amp;#x200B;  If I don't simplify now I will need to in the coming years. I have a couple of years of cash equivalents available and will rebalance annually.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm not keen to just put it all in in an S&amp;P tracker or whatever as I believe tech will out perform for the foreseeable future.

[Perspective: VOO holdings vs Index,;,; VOO is +16.79% YTD.   292 stocks are in the green YTD.   134 stocks within the index are outperforming the index.   109 stocks are better than +20% YTD, and MMC is barely outside of that at +19.98%.   85 stocks are better than +25%.   63 stocks are better than +30%.   52 stocks are better than +35%. AAPL is number 52, meaning that 51 stocks have outperformed AAPL YTD.   41 stocks are better than +40% YTD.

[What percentages of your portfolio are allocated in Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft?,;,; I believe that these companies are too significant to face failure, and their growth will persist in both the short and long term. Additionally, they will gradually acquire additional market share, even venturing into industries such as automotive, as seen with Apple and Google. They will eagerly invest in promising startups, employing any means necessary to eliminate competition and establish dominance. With abundant financial resources and exceptional intellect, they possess the ability to expand continuously. And they will be overvalued too if not already.

[Apple launches its Pay Later service,;,;   Apple on Tuesday introduced Apple Pay Later, which will allow users to split purchases into four payments spread over the course of six weeks.  Affirm dropped 6% on the news.  Apple Pay Later users will be able to manage, track and repay their loans in their Apple Wallet, the company said in a release. Individuals can apply for Apple Pay Later loans of between $50 and $1,000 and use them for in-app and online purchases made through merchants that accept Apple Pay. Payments have no interest and no fees.  The Mastercard Installments program enables Apple Pay Later, so merchants that already accept Apple Pay will not need to make any changes to implement the software for their customers.  Users can apply for a loan within the Apple Wallet app without it affecting their credit score, Apple said. Once they select the amount they would like to withdraw, a soft credit pull will be conducted to make sure they are in ‚Äúa good financial position‚Äù to take on a loan, according to the release.  Apple will invite select people to access a prerelease version of Apple Pay Later on Tuesday, and the company said it plans to expand access to all eligible users in the coming months.  Approved users will see a ‚ÄúPay Later‚Äù option while using Apple Pay to check out online and in apps on iPhones and iPads. They will also be able to apply for a loan right at checkout. Apple said purchases using the software will be authenticated using Face ID, Touch ID or a passcode.

Users will be asked to link a debit card as their loan repayment method. Credit cards won‚Äôt be accepted.,;,; 2023-03-28 19:29:33]

[TSMC posts flat Q4 revenue but beats expectations,;,; TAIPEI, Jan 10 (Reuters) - Taiwan chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW) reported a largely flat fourth-quarter revenue on Wednesday, but that still beat both the company's and market's expectations.   The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple (AAPL.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O), has benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence applications that has helped it weather the tapering off of pandemic-led demand.   Revenue in the final three months of last year came in at T$625.5 billion ($20.10 billion), according to Reuters calculations, compared with $19.93 billion in the year-ago period.  That beat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (TSMC) previous prediction for fourth-quarter revenue being in a range of between $18.8-19.6 billion, and also beat an LSEG SmartEstimate of T$617.1 billion drawn from 21 analysts.     *Source:* [ 2024-01-10 20:51:34]

[Apple beats estimates thanks to iPhone and services, but records fourth consecutive quarterly sales decline,;,; [  Apple     reported fourth fiscal quarter earnings on Thursday that beat analyst expectations for sales and earnings per share, but revealed that overall sales fell for the fourth quarter in a row. Every hardware business outside the iPhone declined year-over-year, with big drops in the iPad and Mac segments.         Apple highlighted stronger-than-expected 16% growth in its online services division to make up for weakness in hardware sales.          Apple shares fell less than 1% in extended trading.        Here‚Äôs how Apple did, versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations:         EPS: $1.46 per share, versus $1.39 per share expected     Revenue: $89.50 billion, versus $89.28 billion expected     iPhone revenue: $43.81 billion, versus $43.81 billion expected     Mac revenue: $7.61 billion versus $8.63 billion expected     iPad revenue: $6.44 billion, versus $6.07 billion expected     Wearables revenue: $9.32 billion, versus $9.43 billion expected     Services revenue: $22.31 billion, versus $21.35 billion expected     Gross margin: 45.2% versus 44.5% expected     Apple didn‚Äôt give formal guidance, but CFO Luca Maestri usually provides data points on the earnings call. Analysts are looking for $122.98 billion in revenue for the December quarter, which would be a return to year-over-year growth in Apple‚Äôs most important quarter.          Net income was $22.96 billion, versus $20.72 billion in net income a year ago. For Apple‚Äôs entire fiscal year, it reported $383.29 billion in sales, down about 3% from Apple‚Äôs fiscal 2022. Quarterly revenue declined less than 1% in the September quarter.         The company‚Äôs iPhone sales were in line with Wall Street expectations and increased more than 2% from last year. It was the only hardware line for Apple to show growth in the quarter, and the period only included about a week of iPhone 15 sales.          Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC that the iPhone 15 was doing better than the iPhone 14 did during the September quarter last year.          ‚ÄúIf you look at iPhone 15 for that period of time and compare it to iPhone 14 for the same time in the year-ago quarter, iPhone 15 did better than iPhone 14,‚Äù Cook told CNBC‚Äôs Steve Kovach. He added that Apple‚Äôs more expensive Pro and Pro Max iPhones were supply constrained because of high demand.          Apple‚Äôs Mac and iPad businesses both suffered during the quarter. Maestri, Apple‚Äôs CFO, had warned on a call with analysts after third-quarter results that iPad and Mac sales would fall by double-digit percentages.         Mac sales came in below Wall Street expectations, falling nearly 34% on an annual basis. Apple held an unusual nighttime launch event for its new MacBook Pro laptops and iMac desktop last month. While sales of the new devices aren‚Äôt included in the quarter, Apple was signaling that new products could boost sales once again thanks to its new M3 chips.         Cook told CNBC that the Mac comparison is to ‚Äúan all-time record‚Äù fourth quarter, which followed a huge supply disruption and pushed what would have been third-quarter sales into the last quarter of 2022. ‚ÄúSo, the comparison point here is very difficult,‚Äù he said.         ‚ÄúI think the Mac is going to have a significantly better quarter in the December quarter. We‚Äôve got the M3, we‚Äôve got the new products, and we don‚Äôt have the compare phenomenon on a year-over-year basis,‚Äù Cook said, referring to an unusually strong market for Macs in 2022.          Cook said that that overall market for personal computers is ‚Äúchallenging.‚Äù         Revenue from iPads was also down big, declining 10% from the same period last year. Apple did not announce new products ahead of the holiday season this year.          Apple‚Äôs services business was a bright spot. Apple recorded $22.31 billion in services revenue, outpacing analyst expectations and increasing over 16% on an annual basis.          Apple‚Äôs services division includes online subscriptions like iCloud storage and Apple Music, as well as warranties from AppleCare. A big chunk of Apple‚Äôs services business comes from its deal with Google for the default search engine on Apple‚Äôs browser, Safari, which has been highlighted in recent weeks as part of the Department of Justice antitrust case against Google. That payment to Apple is worth an estimated $19 billion this year.         Cook said services components including App Store sales, advertising (including the Google deal), iCloud, payment services, and Apple Music did well in the quarter and hit an internal Apple record, signaling continued growth.         ‚ÄúEvery main service hit a record,‚Äù Cook said.          Maestri also noted in a statement that Apple‚Äôs installed base of devices, or the number of iPhones, Macs, and iPads currently in active use, reached an all-time high during the quarter, although Apple did not give an exact number. Analysts say that growth in Apple‚Äôs installed base signals future growth in its services division.          Cook said that Apple had over a billion paid subscriptions, which include both Apple‚Äôs own services as well as apps on the App Store that bill on a recurring basis.          Apple‚Äôs wearables business unit includes headphones like the company‚Äôs AirPods as well as Apple Watch sales. It, too, shrank year-over-year, dropping over 3% on an annual basis.          Apple‚Äôs business in Greater China, its third largest market, is under the microscope as investors worry about increased competition from Huawei. Greater China sales were basically flat year-over-year, and Apple reported $15.08 billion from the region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.          Apple said it would pay a dividend of 24 cents per share this month and said the company had spent $25 billion during the quarter on share repurchases and dividends.  ,;,; 2023-11-02 20:34:03]

I plan on withdrawing all of the money in 2024 to buy my first car for about $20K.  Is this a good strategy? Should I bump up the $20?

[money managers are buying into the rally because they have to. What is their exit plan?,;,; I heard money managers are chasing performance and buying stocks at high prices, window dressing, magnificent 7, like monkeys with a broken sell button.  Maybe they bought AAPL at $190 and NVDA at $500, adding fuel to the rally.

The agency‚Äôs lawsuit could target how the Apple Watch works exclusively with the iPhone, as well as the company‚Äôs iMessage service, which is also solely available on Apple devices. It could also focus on Apple Pay, the company‚Äôs payments system, according to the report."

Edit: For anyone wondering the same thing , I decided to buy individual stocks instead of and ETF. Paying a high MER for an ETf that I liked the portfolio and weighting of is annoying and unnecessary. I like selling ‚Äúsafe covered calls‚Äù so this works out well.

On the other hand, I have unrealized gains on stocks I bought last year close to bottom, including AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL and AMD. I do not want to sell my winner because I believe in those stocks for long term. So I now have large realized capital losses with little capital gains. I cannot recover these losses if I do not sell my winners.  Should I create a separate small account for short term investment to buy and sell stocks to recover these losses?

[What's your largest individual stock holding? (No shilling, please).,;,; Howdy everybody. Lately, I've been investing more in individual stocks that are undervalued, as opposed to putting it in ETF's that are at ATH. Thus far, my strategy has outperformed the overall market by quite a bit. I'm up 20% since starting this strategy about 6 months ago, versus the overall market being up by about 10% in the same time period. Yes, I understand there's inherently more risk with individual stocks. Also, FWIW, I'm not bragging, just giving some depth to the conversation and my reasoning for asking these questions. Anyway, moving on. I'm looking to expand that number of individual stock holdings, but also diversity into new holdings as opposed to taking bigger positions on what I already own. Im looking for crowd favorites for individual stock holdings. So my question to you all is this: For those who don't have *all* of their money in ETF's, what is the single stock you hold the most of? How much of that holding represents your overall portfolio? Are these long-term holdings, or have you purchased shares lately? Why is that particular stock your largest individual holding?   I'll leave mine out for the time being because I don't want this to come across as a shilling post or for it to devolve into an argument. I genuinely want to know what you guys are holding.

[Bought my first individual stock today.,;,; I bought MSFT around 10:30am, which I plan to hold for a long time.   It's already gone up 1%, not that it won't go down again.  It will be fun to watch.  I hope this kind of post is okay.  I'm just excited.  (Up until today its all been in managed accounts.  This was an impulse buy driven by my personal interest (AI), so I hope this wasn't too irrational of a purchase.  Technically I had some MSFT in my managed account, but this was the first time I bought on my own, separately.  I'm usually too much of a chicken to buy stocks.  This is less than 1% of my total.)  ----  UPDATE: Since I'm getting some salty and sarcastic comments, I'll explain my thinking, although it'll likely attract more saltiness:  I'm gambling Microsoft will become the leader in AI given what's happened in the last 24 hours. OpenAI's loss of staff (up to 70%!) and leadership will cause it to go into permanent stagnation and lose its lead (unless they pull off some miracle this week).   MSFT is perfectly positioned to take over OpenAI's near monopoly on consumer AI in less than a year. They already know how to operate OpenAI's hardware infrastructure and have poached many of OpenAI's employees and leadership.  AI is the "next big thing", as big as the PC, the Internet, or the iPhone, and AGI, in whenever year it comes, will be even bigger.  AI hasn't fully saturated all domains, yet, so the full impact hasn't been felt by most people or industries... yet.  People are commenting, "but it's at ATH", which is true.  AAPL was at an all time high in late 2006 (if I have the timing right), and then the iPhone happened.  And all that said, this is 1% of my portfolio.  Calm down.  This was for fun.  I was hoping this would be a friendly community.  edit: removed how many shares I bought as it bothered some people.,;,; 2023-11-20 17:13:05]

[I started investing in March 2019 and every year I'm in the red. What would you do?,;,; A couple days ago there was a post about your biggest wins. Some users turned 45k into 1.1m or how they invested in amc and made retirement level money.   [ is how my portfolio looks like vs sp500 since March 2019)  * 2019: +18% * 2020: -6% * 2021: -7.5% * 2022: -6.2% * 2023: -15% Ytd (mostly etf, energy and tech)   I started investing in individual stocks and etfs with the strategy of "taking profits if it looks too good and selling off if I lose more than 50%"  My major trades:  - sold 50 tsla with 200% in 2020. It looked too good to be true especially when the whole economy was contracting due to covid. Luxury tech cars would be the first to go. If I had waited 2 years it would be +2000%.  - bought 2x inversed sp500 in January 2020 but forgot that 15% unemployement and all the shops closed is  like nothing for US economy. A milion deaths here and there doesn't change anything.  - bought 100 GME in 2019 and sold them for a loss just before the short squeeze because the stock has been on a downfall ever since. I hoped for a pivot of the whole strategy of gamestop for more than a year and finally sold not seeing any upward movement. Instead of +3800% got -27% - BYND -92%. I broke my rule here because I was on holidays when it dropped.  - Sold CDR before Cyberpunk release and got +120% because I knew it will be reciebed badly by critics but then bought back "at sale" shortly after the fall and sold at a loss seeing how it trends down.  - sold 100 NVDA in 2020 with +60%. Now it would be  +1000%  My overall realized gains is  -$8,000 and ytd is -15%  There is no hope at all for me. I tried to understand the stock market and can't. Since 2020 there is no logic. Penny stocks are doing +1000%, strong companies that have positive cash flows and very low liabilities are just cruising or going down. Bad companies not bringing any profits are exploding because they are being memes.  And I dont know what to do because it looks like the stock market will be flat for the next couple of years and interest rates for real estate are so humongous I don't qualify. I thought the stock market is the way to park money but this + inflation = I'm losing money left and right.  Edit: major stocks that I still hold since 2019. Enph, sedg, dis, msft, AMD, wm, mmm, aapl, atvi.  Edit2: thanks for all the hate!,;,; 2023-09-19 14:43:10]
[Everything I'm watching and Analysing in premarket 16/01. Includes analysis of Tesla, Forex and Levels to Watch for the day,;,; **ANALYSIS:**  * We are seeing a slight decline in premarket. That‚Äôs in part due to the sell off in AAPL and TSLA, which are big components of the indices.  * But we can look more into it and see that there have been a rebalancing of rate cut bets for March this morning, following UK employment data. The chance of rate cut in march is now showing at 66% vs 77% on Friday on CME Fedwatch tool, with chance of no cut rising to 30%.     * This is the result of the move higher in USD in premarket, reaching 1 month highs at the key level of 103.3 on DXY.     * This is in part due to UK employment data which came strong, even though the wage growth came in lower, which led GBP lower.     * We cans ee that because of this volatility in the dollar in premarket, traders are hedging with OTM put options, which has brought skew down slightly. But money flow block traders remain v high.     * Vix has jumped, will likely come down and can fuel buy the dip later in session.    This is confirmed by selling of puts on nasdaq.     * Key levels to watch on TESLA are at 200, a smaller level at 210. * Key level on AAPL is 180. * NVDA and MSFt, both of which have more bullish positioning than other Mag 7 firms, are both green in premarket, but barely.      **Let‚Äôs look at positioning on IWM, since I have been requested this a few times.**      * Spot price is below the key gamma level of 195, and block trade flows are showing increased short selling from hedge funds. Skew is lwoer too.  * All in all, it looks like IWM is positioned to move lower in short term. * We can see from the blue line below that hedge funds have been taking profit since the start of the year.  * Main options are selling fo call options which is bearish.     * [      * Theres a gamma level at 190, which is likely to be the low of the day.    Below that, Put support is at 185.       **Now a bit on FX:**  * Skew is pulling back a bit on EURUSD after data this morning. We are seeing traders hedge their long with OTM put with strike 1.08. * Still, open interest on 1.10 is v high, we can expect a reversal tot here hopefully soon, depending on data.      **INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH**     * Goldman Sachs released a report that earnings momentum has trended down since the start of Q4 2023, following weakness in Euro area PMIs. They highlighted the chart below to show how profit downgrades have outpaced profit upgrades over the past few months, despite equity prices moving higher. They used this as evidence to suggest equity prices can do some correction this earnings season.  * [      * Deutsche Bank put out a piece where they were clear outliers against the consensus expectation for Q4 2023 earnings to tick lower. Dutch bank. Expects them to come out at record highs.  * [      * Blackrock put out a piece where they argued that the optimism on rate cuts in the US is currently overdone. In a similar piece, Barclays moved back their expectation of first rate cuts in March, now expecting the first rate cut to be in June. Goldman is currently an outlier, as they still anticipate first rate cut for Fed in March, with ECB and BOE tor ollow later.      * Bank of America said in their EPFR report that flows into equity funds went negative this past week to -9.5b from +4.4b the week before.      **DATA LEDE:**  * Australia WESTPAC consumer confidence index decline slightly from 82.1 to 81. It has remained in this range of 79 to 82 for much of the year so this is no major concern.     * Japan PPI comes in hotter than expected, at 0.3% MOM vs 0% forecast. YOY at 0% vs -0.3% forecast.   PPI is a leading indicator of CPI. YOY flat for first time since feb 2021, no increase. That‚Äôs probably not great for BOJ who want to see persistently higher inflation.    * **UK EMPLOYMENt NUMBERS:**   Employment change came stronger than expected at 73k vs 50k forecast. This is the highest read since April last year. Points to a stronger than expected jobs market.    Unemployment rate came in line with expectations at 4.2%   Average earnigns incl bonus came less than expected, at 6.5% vs 6.8% forecast.     * We can see it was a mixed bag. Jobs report mostly came stronger than expected, in the headline employment change number, but the wage inflation aspect came less than expected, and that‚Äôs indicative of future services inflation.    GBP mostly flat on this, although USD is higher, which is hurting the GBPUSD pair.    Makes sense GBP relatively flat as rate cut bets are steady after the data, with 134BPS of 2024 cuts priced.     * **ZEW economic index for Euro and Germany both came stronger than expected, Germany‚Äôs came as highest since February last year.**    Survey showed that more than 2/3 of respondents expect rate cuts by Fed in next 6 months.      **FOREX:**  * AUD is following Chinese markets lower, compounded by the weaker confidence number.     * GBP itself is relatively flat, slightly lower following employment change, but USD is rallying which is hurting the GBPUSD pair. Makes sense GBP relatively flat as rate cut bets are steady after the data, with 134BPS of 2024 cuts priced.     * Euro partly lower as 1 year inflation expectations drop to 1.5 year low.     * Yen slightly higher after PPI numbers, but USDJPY higher on rising dollar.     * DXY up 0.6% to a key level of 103.3    * AUDUSD sitting at 0.66 key level.  * EURUSD broke below 1.09 level * GBP 1.26 as support.      **MARKETS:**  * European markets lower as they follow EURUSD lower this morning. Yesterday was at resistance of 16800, but fell yesterday back to 16.6k. Continued lower during Asian session, then during Europe open.     * HKG50 - broke 16k, now trading at 15.87k. Moving lower as Taiwan election and lack of rate cuts yesterday hurt sentiment slightly.     * SPX: Rejected at 4800 on Friday. Yesterday was flat due to public holiday, around 4780. Moved slightly lwoer during European session.    AAPL weighing on index, down 1.8% in premarket. TSLA down 1.7%    * NASDAQ: down 0.5% in premarket, trading at 16,750. Its below the 2021 high, will be trying to recover this level. Can get rejected there.     * Oil - North Dakota oil production is down 400k barrels per day due to freezing weather, which as a supply restriction, should support price. The fundamentals of the oil market with the Rede Sea tensions is supporting oil, as it maintains the green despite rising dollar which would normally Drag oil into the red.     * US Bond yields moving slightly higher today.      **KEY LEVELS TO WATCH BASED ON THE OPTIONS MARKET:**     * **SPX**: * Call resistance remains at 4800. This will be a big barrier to break and will be a big resistance.    We are seeing some gamma building on 4825, but is small. But some traders are looking higher now.  * HVL is 4745, there‚Äôs a big gamma level around 4750-4745. We can expect this to act as some support.     * Low of the day if we get there is likely to be 4740, says my quant.    4750/4745 to offer some support before then probably.  * High of the day likely to be 4800.    * These levels were drawn without the TESLA, AAPL news included. A big move in AAPL and TESLA and these levels can break.     * **QQQ**: * Call resistance at 410 which will be hard to break.  * If we do break that then next gamma level up is at 412.     * Key areas of support are at 406 which is the HVL   Then below that, the min of the day that my quant is telling me is 404. Expect a bounce from there.     * That‚Äôs around the low of the day from Thursday for those wondering.      **MAG 7 NEWS:**     * AAPL - has offered Chinese customers a 5% discount on iPhone 15s, in a bid to try to drum up demand, in what is currently a flagging market for them.     * AAPL has also decided to remove their blood oxygen sensor from their watch, in order to avoid the US ban.

[Apple stock analysis and valuation - Why Warren Buffett loves it,;,; This week‚Äôs casual valuation is Apple. I hope you enjoy these posts and feel free to add your take.  *Disclaimer: I do not own shares in Apple.*  &amp;#x200B;  The post is divided into the following sections:  ‚Ä¢	Introduction  ‚Ä¢	Historical financial performance  ‚Ä¢	The balance sheet  ‚Ä¢	Assumptions and valuation  ‚Ä¢	Valuation based on different assumptions (and discount rate)  &amp;#x200B;  **Introduction**  Apple is the largest public company with a market cap of almost $3 trillion. We can go look back at its history and admire its outstanding performance, but even if we take a look at the last 5 years, its share price is up over 300%! For comparison, S&amp;P500 is up 60% over the same period.  My one-sentence summary of Apple would be ‚Äì **A technology company with strong brand and pricing power.**  At the end of March 2023, Apple was 46% of Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs portfolio.  Since Q1/2016 until today, Berkshire has bought over a billion shares in Apple at an average price of $39.65, leading to a total cost of almost $42 billion. Out of all the shares bought, 123 million have been sold for $12.5 billion, and the remaining 916 million shares have a market value of $171 billion. This leads to a return of 346%, excluding dividends.  &amp;#x200B;  **Historical financial performance**  Since 2017, Apple provides a split of its revenue into:  &amp;#x200B;  * Products (iPhone, iPad, AirPods, Mac, Apple TV, Apple Watch, etc.) * Services (Advertising, Cloud, Digital content, App store fees, Payment services, etc.)  Why is this relevant? Well, services naturally have higher margins.  If we take a look at the data related to this split, we'll see that the % of revenue generated from services increased from 14% back in 2017, to 21% today.  This is an important piece of the valuation puzzle. The assumptions regarding future profitability depend on the assumptions about how this will develop in the future. If the trend continues and services increase as % of revenue, then **higher profitability should be expected**. If the trend reverses, then **lower profitability should be expected.**  Many analysts point to iPhone as the biggest risk. Back in 2017, iPhone sales were responsible for 62% of all of Apple's revenue. Over the last twelve months, that % is down to 52%. It is still significant and it should not be ignored. If Apple disappoints with the next iPhone model, it will have a significant impact on its profitability, and valuation. It can also be argued that the new models aren't significantly better than the previous ones and come with slight design changes and limited additional features. However, as long as the customers are willing to pay for them, well, that's what matters.  &amp;#x200B;  Let's take a look at the financials and how they've changed over the last 5 years.  The gross profit increased from 38% in 2019 to 43% for the last twelve months (ending April 1st, 2023). Based on the development of the mix between products/services, this doesn't come as a surprise.  The operating expenses (Research &amp; Development, and Selling, General &amp; Administrative) have been incredibly stable, between 13-14% (combined) of revenue. Many investors love predictability, and Apple definitely delivers that.  All of the above translates to an increase in the operating margin from 25% back in 2019 to 29% over the last twelve months.  With revenue of $385 billion, Apple is generating over $100 billion in operating profit per year.  More importantly, during this period, there were two events that impacted most of the companies:  **The pandemic (Covid-19)** and **high inflation.**  We cannot see any negative impact coming from these events on Apple's financials. It continued to perform exceptionally even through uncertain and difficult times. The increased costs (due to raw materials, but also higher employee salaries) were successfully passed on to the final customers.  It doesn't come as a surprise that Warren Buffett loves it. What is there not to love?  &amp;#x200B;  **The balance sheet**  So, what happens with all of the excess cash that is consistently being generated? It is being returned back to the shareholders, via share buybacks and dividends.  Over the last decade, Apple reduced the # of outstanding shares by a third. In addition, its annual dividend payment is over $14 billion per year.  The decision to return cash back to the shareholders is basically the management admitting that they don't have projects to invest in, that will yield acceptable returns. Whether buybacks are the way to go at today's share price, is another question.  If we take a look at the balance sheet, the company has $180 billion of cash, short and long-term investments. Although this might sound impressive, this is roughly 5% of their market cap.  On the other side of the balance sheet, there's $110 billion in debt (including leases).  &amp;#x200B;  **Assumptions and valuation**  Here are my assumptions for the future:  **Revenue growth:** 7% per year over the next 3 years, then declining over time to 4%. With this assumption, revenue in 10 years' time increases by 71%  **Operating margin:** 29%, increasing to 32% over the next decade (I expect services to increase as % of revenue, leading to higher margins)  **Discount rate:** 11% discounting to 8.7% over time  &amp;#x200B;  After adjusting for what is on their balance sheet, as well as the equity options outstanding, the value of Apple is roughly **$2 trillion ($127.24/share).**  For comparison, today‚Äôs market cap is 2.94 trillion ($186.68/share).  &amp;#x200B;  **Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**  The future is uncertain and my assumptions could be significantly wrong. Let's take a look at how the valuation (per share) changes if we use different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now as well as the operating margin.  &amp;#x200B;  |Revenue / Operating margin|28%|30%|32%|34%|CAGR| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |50% ($578b)|$101.9|$108.7|$113.9|$119.6|4.1%| |71% ($657b)|$113.7|$121.4|$127.2|$133.8|5.5%| |100% ($770b)|$128.5|$137.3|$144.2|$151.8|7.2%| |160% ($999b)|$155.0|$169.1|$177.9|$187.6|10.0%|  For Apple to be fairly valued, it needs to grow its revenue at 10% annually over the next decade and increase its operating margin from its current 29% to 34%.  At the moment, the market is paying a significant premium for Apple and there is positive sentiment around the company.  Overall, I do like the company, and I can see myself buying shares at a reasonable price. It is quite clear that Buffett got a great deal by buying shares at an average price of $39.65.  &amp;#x200B;  As always, thank you for reading the post and for all the support.,;,; 2023-06-25 14:06:46]
[Question About Good Faith Violations (non-margin/cash account),;,; With a cash account (no margin), let‚Äôs say someone want to make 1 swing trade per day, every single day using their full account balance.  Scenario:   $10,000 account   On Monday I sell $10,000 worth of AMZN to purchase $10,000 of AAPL   On Tuesday I sell all shares of AAPL to purchase $10,000 of TSLA   On Wednesday, I sell all TSLA shares to purchase $10,000 of GOOG  In this scenario, I would incur a good faith violation, correct? Because I used the proceeds of a sale to purchase another security and then sold the newly purchased security before the original funds used to make that purchased had settled? Or am I incorrect?  Most of my accounts are margin accounts, but I have 1 non-margin account that I am interested in doing this type of daily swing trading in and I'm trying to understand how good faith violations work and if this is possible without incurring violations.

[An Exploration of Analyst Ratings and Stock Market Bias,;,; TLDR - Potential heavy bias on aggregated ratings towards buy/outperform ratings with virtually no sell/underperform ratings on aggregate. Is this justified in your opinion?   Hello everyone,   I‚Äôve embarked on an interesting project recently. I wanted to build a neural network model. The goal? To analyze stock data (fundamentals and price data) from Thompson Reuters and respective analyst ratings.   The idea was to identify companies that are either unrated or not followed by analysts, and use the model to assign them theoretical ratings. Additionally, I wanted to spot companies with changing fundamentals that are likely to be re-rated soon, potentially leading to significant price movements.   My dataset primarily consists of US-listed stocks across major exchanges and pink slips. However, it also includes stocks listed on the Frankfurt and London stock exchanges, as these are the three regions where I trade/invest. For more international exposure, I use ETFs.   In total, my investable universe comprises around 17-18K stocks, with 7624 of them having an analyst following. Thompson Reuters provides a ‚Äúscore‚Äù from 1-5 for each stock, where 1 is a strong buy/overperform and 5 is a sell.   To quickly clarify and avoid any confusion this initial test is only for aggregated ratings for stocks for example AAPL was recently given a downgrade by Barclays which led to it losing a considerable amount of market cap. However, the aggregate rating given for AAPL is still a "Buy".   On aggregate, there‚Äôs a heavy skew to the upside, as seen below:   Rating Number Percentage   Hold 1488 19.5%   Buy 3882 50.9%   Overperform 2120 27.8%   Underperform 117 1.5%   Sell 17 0.2%   This leads me to question the validity of these results. Should nearly 80% of stocks have a buy or outperform rating? Especially in a market that is relatively/historically quite expensive, this seems incredibly high.   While I wouldn‚Äôt trade/buy based on any given analyst ratings, this project was more of a fun side venture. However, I‚Äôm somewhat disappointed with the results of this data-gathering stage, as any model trained in this way will be heavily biased and statistically insignificant unless you believe that the analysts on aggregate are correct.   I plan to start gathering this data over time, but unless something significant happens to the economy, I‚Äôm not sure if the aggregate data will be that interesting, other than indicating a potential heavy bias.   My next step is to examine the individual numbers for each stock in terms of the number of buys/holds/sells, etc., and see if I can derive something more meaningful to model as well as maybe try and explore the validity of the aggregated ratings. I enjoy creating models, even if they‚Äôre not always for practical purposes.   This exploration has shown why downgrades seem to hit a company a lot harder than upgrades.   I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on analyst ratings/reports in general as well as if you think that analyst ratings are justified or not.,;,; 2024-01-14 21:49:52]
[4 Tech stocks benefiting from the AI boom.,;,; The world of artificial intelligence (AI) these days is overwhelmingly dominated by discussions on generative AI and its implications. Simply put, generative AI is a form of machine learning through which AI software can produce text, video, images, and more. Basically, generative AI can produce any form of content on the basis of prompts. This form of AI became more widespread and renowned after the launch of ChatGPT and similar generative AI platforms, which revolutionized the AI sector while pulling in major tech companies to become part of the AI race.        This form of AI and its impact on the markets was discussed by Jim Stewart, a New York Times columnist, on CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' on June 16. According to Stewart, big tech companies, especially those that are AI beneficiaries, have been leading the recent stock market rally. These include companies such as Microsoft Corporation ($MSFT), Alphabet Inc. ($GOOG), and NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA). Stewart claimed that he was bullish on AI, especially considering the fact that this technology could boost productivity gains across different fields, including journalism.        **AI and the US Stock Market**    In May, NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) joined the group of companies with valuations in trillions of dollars. Many financial professionals today are attributing the gains of the S&amp;P 500 to AI, primarily, with the focus being on NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA) and other big tech companies that have begun incorporating AI and generative AI in their products and services.        This overwhelming focus on a select few number of companies that can successfully play the AI boom and come out victorious has led to many investors worrying that the stock market in 2023 will turn into a selection of a few winners and a lot more losers. The S&amp;P 500 has "basically been the S&amp;P 7," a reference to the fact that only seven major tech companies have been calling the shots so far in 2023, leading the market to heavily rely on them and their gains.        **"You Are At The Starting Line Of AI"**    This reality has led many professionals and corporations to realize that the AI boom is very real and may be here to stay. Companies today will be bound to figure out where they stand in this environment and how they can integrate AI into their business models to reap the benefits of this technological revolution. NVIDIA Corporation's ($NVDA) CEO, Jensen Huang, in an address at the National Taiwan University in May, stated that we are currently at "the starting line of AI" and that at this moment, we should run instead of walking. The implications of his statement are many, but perhaps the most obvious lesson to take away from Huang's speech is that companies and individuals today shouldn't be slow to join the AI race - they should try their best to become part of it and ensure they don't end up getting left behind by their competitors.        Keeping the above-mentioned market dynamics and developments in mind, I have compiled a list of the top tech stocks to consider investing in to play the AI boom. I included the obvious stock picks because of their contributions to this industry so far, but I also attempted to find other companies that wouldn't be the first to come to your mind when looking at AI beneficiaries today.   # Our Methodology    To select our stocks, I  looked at which companies analysts are expecting to benefit from the AI boom and shortlisted them based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the first quarter of 2023. The stocks are ranked based on this metric, from the lowest to the highest number of hedge funds long each of them.  # Tech Stocks Benefiting From The AI Boom      **1. Oracle Corporation ($ORCL)**       On June 13, Keith Bachman at BMO Capital raised his price target on Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) from $96 to $132. The analyst also holds a Market Perform rating on the stock.        Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) is an information technology company based in Austin, Texas. The company's products and services address enterprise information technology environments across the world.        I saw 67 hedge funds long Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $2.9 billion.        TD Cowen's John Blackledge expects Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) to benefit from the current AI boom because its cloud-computing platform can offer it some competitive advantages.        First Eagle Investment Management held 20.7 million shares in Oracle Corporation ($ORCL) at the end of the first quarter, making it the largest shareholder in the company.  **2. CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD)**        CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) is an information technology company offering cybersecurity products and services. It is based in Austin, Texas.        There were 72 hedge funds holding stakes in CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) at the end of the first quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $2.4 billion.        CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) may be an interesting stock pick to play the AI boom considering the company has recently announced new AI-powered indicators of attack (IoA) models. These models can combat advanced adversary tradecraft by using machine intelligence to stop breaches.        Tal Liani at Bank of America holds a Buy rating on CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. ($CRWD) shares as of June 16. The analyst also raised the firm's price target on the stock from $162 to $190.  **3. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD)**        Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) was spotted in the portfolios of 91 hedge funds in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $4.9 billion.        Based in Santa Clara, California, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) is a semiconductor company that operates globally.        Joseph Moore, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, raised his price target on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) shares on June 16 from $97 to $138. The analyst also holds an Overweight rating on the shares.        Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) is a chipmaker that TD Cowen's John Blackledge has picked as one of his tech stocks to play the AI boom. This is unsurprising considering the fact that this June, the company revealed its new AI chip in its race with NVIDIA Corporation ($NVDA). The new MI300X chip was described by Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) as "the world's most advances accelerator for generative AI."        Citadel Investment Group held 13.9 million shares in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ($AMD) at the end of the first quarter, making the fund the most prominent shareholder in the company for that quarter.  **4. Adobe Inc. ($ADBE)**        Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) is a diversified software and information technology company based in San Jose, California. The company's flagship product is its Creative Cloud, a subscription service offering members access to its creative products.        John Blackledge at TD Cowen sees Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) as a smart AI play because the company has begun rolling out new generative-AI content creation tools.        An Outperform rating was reiterated on Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) shares on June 16 by Kirk Materne at Evercore ISI. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $475 to $590.        A total of 99 hedge funds were long Adobe Inc. ($ADBE) in the first quarter, with a total stake value of $7.3 billion.  **4. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)**        Apple Inc. ($AAPL) may not be the first big tech company that comes to your mind when looking for AI plays, but with the company's new Vision Pro headset, some believe it may be getting involved in the machine learning space more than before.        Analysts at Bernstein hold a Market Perform rating and a $175 price target on Apple Inc. ($AAPL) shares as of June 14.        Our hedge fund data for the first quarter shows 131 hedge funds long Apple Inc. ($AAPL). Their total stake value was $165 billion.        Holding 915.6 million shares in the company, Berkshire Hathaway was the largest stakeholder in Apple Inc. ($AAPL) at the end of the first quarter.,;,; 2023-06-21 06:45:44]
[What are 'safe' high returning stocks to invest in?,;,; For example, over the last 10 years - as far as index funds for annual returns:  QQQ has returned 15.5% IVV has returned 9.9% VOO has returned 9.8% S&amp;P 500 has returned 9.6% VTI has returned 9.6%  And for individual stocks annual returns: PANW has returned 30% AAPL has returned 27% MSFT has returned 25%  I know the stocks aren't guaranteed to keep up this pace, but I feel like as they are over fairly consistent over the last 10 years, they're "safer" than others.   Just was curious what other stocks might make sense for my portfolio that are higher returning and relatively safe whether individual stocks, or index funds.

[My thoughts on the market for the next two months,;,; First, I don‚Äôt think the market has much further to fall, as long as the rates stabilize here (they appear to have begun to). Earnings so far are fine ‚Äî not disastrous as Mr. Wilson of Morgan Stanley has predicted, and even his target for year end is 3900, so I think we should be comfortably above that at year end, i.e. at or above where we are right now.  That of course will not be true if there will be a credit event, but I think the chance is very small, and the government would step in as they did in March.  However I do think the magnificent 7 will likely underperform, as their valuations are stretched. Among them I‚Äôm most concerned about Apple, as it‚Äôs the most susceptible to consumers and also to geopolitical risks.  For the next two months I will be closely watching rates and looking for opportunities in fixed income, utilities, energy, and reits. But if any high quality names will be on sale I will try to grab some shares!,;,; 2023-10-29 18:30:11]
[Micron Stock Tumbles as China Says Its Chips Are Security Risk,;,; Micron Technology Inc.‚Äôs stock dropped more than 6% after China‚Äôs cyberspace regulator said that its products failed to pass a cybersecurity review in the country.  Beijing warned operators of key infrastructure against buying the company‚Äôs goods, saying it found ‚Äúrelatively serious‚Äù cybersecurity risks in Micron products sold in the country. The components caused ‚Äúsignificant security risks to our critical information infrastructure supply chain,‚Äù which would affect national security, according to the statement from the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC.Micron‚Äôs shares dropped as much as 6.8% in premarket trading, which would be the biggest intraday fall since November if it holds during regular trading. The stock had gained 36% this year, closing at $68.17 on Friday.  The CAC had said about six weeks ago that it was launching a security review of imports from Micron, the US‚Äôs last major memory chipmaker.  The tech sector has become a key battlefield over national security between the two largest economies, with Washington having already blacklisted Chinese tech firms, cut off the flow of sophisticated processors and banned its citizens from providing certain help to the Chinese chip industry. In a statement, the US Commerce Department said Beijing‚Äôs conclusion had ‚Äúno basis in fact‚Äù and Washington will continue to try and limit industry disruptions with its allies.  **US Chipmakers Are Heavily Reliant on China**  Micron is less dependent on the country than many of its peersPercent of revenue from China  * Qualcomm: 64% * Broadcom: 35% * Intel: 27% * AMD: 22% * Nvidia: 21% * Micron: 11%  ^(Source: Company data compiled by BloombergNote: In some cases, China revenue includes chips for devices that are exported for sale elsewhere)  ‚ÄúNo one should understand this decision by CAC as anything but retaliation for the US‚Äôs export controls on semiconductors,‚Äù said Holden Triplett, founder of Trenchcoat Advisors and a former FBI counterintelligence official in Beijing. ‚ÄúNo foreign business operating in China should be deceived by this subterfuge. These are political actions pure and simple, and any business could be the next one to be made an example of.‚Äù  The move brings fresh uncertainty to the other US chipmakers that sell to China, the world‚Äôs biggest market for semiconductors. Companies like Qualcomm Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Intel Corp. deliver billions of chips to the country, which puts the components inside electronic products that are shipped all over the world.  The Chinese cyber agency said in its statement Sunday that, while the country welcomes products and services provided by companies of all countries as long as they comply with its laws and regulations, the investigation into Micron products are a ‚Äúnecessary measure‚Äù to safeguard national security. It didn‚Äôt detail what the security risks were or identify specific Micron products that are now barred.Micron, which has previously said it stood by the security of its products and commitments to customers, said in a statement Sunday it‚Äôs evaluating the conclusion of the review. The company is assessing its next steps, adding that it looks forward ‚Äúto continuing to engage in discussions with Chinese authorities.‚Äù  Analysts at Jefferies including Edison Lee said in a research report that the CAC‚Äôs decision will likely have a small impact on Micron because it focuses on ‚Äúcritical information infrastructure,‚Äù meaning operations like data centers and cloud computing services with security risks. Most of Micron‚Äôs memory chips sold in China are actually used in consumer electronics, like smartphones and notebooks, they said.  ‚ÄúWe believe this ban is narrowly focused as it applies to only CII operators,‚Äù they wrote. ‚ÄúTherefore, the ultimate impact on Micron will be quite limited.‚Äù  Source: [ 2023-05-22 09:18:14]
[The future picks and shovels of AI may not be GPUs but ASICs, following the crypto trajectory. GOOGL and the dreaded Samsung appear to be the leaders in this space. What is the highest-weighted Samsung ETF and what are other industry-leading AI FPGA/ASICs tickers?,;,; For context and a disclaimer, I own NVDA (and AAPL and ASML) in this space, having ridden through the last crash and rebound without checking my portfolio and counting fake money, but I am overexposed and don't want to add to the overweighted positions now.   I think that NVDA will always be an important company at the forefront of AI research, there is a good chance that NVDA's trajectory could be similar to its performance after the fall of cr*pto for the same reasons. In NVDA's favor, you can read any AI paper, which will be benchmarked on NVDA GPUs, download the requisite libraries, and do it yourself. It is a royal pain to implement algorithms on any other GPU even if you found a programmer with a 5-page blog post about how to do it with lots of particular versions of out-dated libraries, so I own NVDA. CUDA rocks, but NVDA doesn't want to let it out. Metal for OSX is pretty good, but no one uses it and AAPL doesn't do serious system on a chip cluster/cloud computing yet, though they will have an announcement 2-3 years out given Tim Cook's slow feet. For example, we are going to see AAPL AR/VR this week, but he probably didn't shovel out AAPL's piles of cash until FB announced that it was now Meta and that Zuckerberg would be the lord of the metaverse with the most awesome meta-real-estate.  Back to the previous fall of NVDA, you could once pool mine shitcoins with GPUs, I've done it, but that became energetically unprofitable when people found a cheaper way to do it, first with FPGAs and then with ASICs, which require millions and millions more to make work once you know exactly what you need to make. The advantage is that fewer operations occur with parallelizable algorithms, and FPGAs use less energy than do-anything GPU/CPU computations, but they are an expensive pain to program. When you are absolutely done building a better mousetrap, ASICs use the least amount of energy and can perform operations much faster and price-out GPUs in terms of upfront costs (once printed) and recurring energy costs. There was a time when you couldn't but NVDA's best GPUs for gaming because people were using them to mine shitcoins (diclaimer: I own a less than 5% stake of ETH2, and negligible bitcoin, only as an alternative to shit-yield savings accounts, which would be better off in treasuries anyway). I digress. A point came where it was dumb to mine with GPUs because ASICs arrived, and proof-of-work algorithms made it dumb to mine in the first place, which was waste of carbon footprint in the first place. Then, NVDA GPU prices crashed along with NVDA stock, but NVDA was still the machine learning leader. At some point, this will happen to NVDA again. MSFT is already shoveling cash at AMD to build their next AI supercomputer to undercut NVDA prices, but AMD's price is too high right now for me, even when I love tech stocks as I don't plan to retire for decades, and I think AMD won't win with their GPUs in the very long term because of ASICs, even if they make a CUDA-clone language and open source it.    Years ago, a paper titled "Attention is all you need" rocked the AI world and spawned GPT, GPT2, up to GPT4. Given the fifth largest GPU-based supercomptuer, a search engine's worth of data that people gave away, you can build a great AI mousetrap that can do the job students and corporate middle managers and pencil pushers. In a decade or two, programming complex programs with human-levels of bugs and mistakes will be a reality. We have a good mousetrap. Googles TPU v4 supercomputers use optics-based AI ASICs produced and patented by Samsung. I used to be a fan of Samsung, but then new management took over and it has dived off a cliff. Their appliances have the performance of robots bathed in saltwater, and I swore of Samsung phones after using them since forever when they started pushing shit malware games and apps onto my phone with every urgent security update, and every new phone increasingly locked app developers out of the real hardware, so you could use the Samsung app for a camera, but nothing else. But, and please correct me if I am wrong, I think Samsung may be the current leader in AI ASICs. I thinking GOOGL is still behind and their new Samsung-based supercomputer is the wrong mousetrap, but GOOGL programmers have certainly already been tasked with building a GOOGL v5 supercomputer that is dedicated to the transformers that underpin GPT through GPT4. I don't own GOOGL, but I may buy it during market corrections.    Unfortunately, I don't have hundreds of K for an international account, and the Samsung OTC ticker doesn't correlate with Samsung's price in Korea and I don't trust it. I read about ETFs trying to reduce Samsung's weight, but I want an ETF that is dominated by it. Samsung still makes great sensors, invests heavily in research, and some departments within the fetid bureaucracy are still highly competent. So, please offer any ETF suggestions. I am fine with also investing in Korea's broader tech industry, despite the problems with Asian tech companies and their lagging China-based supply chains and the problems with China deciding that money is no longer free in its state-based kleptocracy economy.   Please send me any tickers that I can research that may not have caught the current AI wave and that might still be well positioned for large future returns assuming that AI ASICs become the future, which I feel is a given. This might include companies dedicated to programming FPGAs and ASICs.,;,; 2023-06-02 16:41:58]
[Think I nailed the Q1/Q2 market maker swings,;,; Macro events aside , think I just nailed my Q1 /Q2 thesis on the market maker swings  Been sizing this up since Jan 1 (drops ) and then the Quad Witch of Jan 21 (1st fake rally) . It helped me develop a theory that allowed me to nail the swings today .  Theory :  - Triple and Quad witch index  call options that opened middle of last year were bought en masse by the banks . Those dates are key, because the banks will win on those bets .  That‚Äôs March 17, June 16, and Sept 15 .   - The near and mid term options that opened shortly after the Quad Witch Day , that are in between that day and the next Quad Witch are a bank hedge, and a retail trap. Between SPY and QQQ‚Ä¶the bigs are typically the wealthy ones with enough shares in holdings to sell fresh call options . They are the seller of these fresh, near term options .   - CPI and PPI and fed rate dates happen in between . General market consensus Forrest-through-trees is 2024 is latest for market to recover (Those are the nearest term calls available after September btw ).   - If the market trades sideways first half of the year , max pain for retail is down/flat during the in- between weeks of quad witch . That means retail loses on those fresh, less expensive calls that suddenly open during a rally . Bigs collect time premium . They sell old shares to aid the process .   - Retail either sells at a partial or total loss, or jumps to next week waiting on the recovery .   - Bigs then use fresh profits from collecting time premium (selling all of us stupid retailers the near term calls ), and average back into their holdings for a quad witch rally . That was this las few trading days .    What I did :  - I‚Äôm not into charts but Nasdaq clearly has its resistance points at the major spots (e.g. 11k,11.5k,12k, etc )   - I bought calls on the last false rally for March 21. I closed some green (SPY and DAPP),  exercised a few, left a couple open (AAPL and Etsy) , and I sold out slowly of the cash call. I had a couple days to watch for the fresh calls to open for the weeks before the next big month available (April 21 has been open for a bit ).   - That day was Friday and Today ‚Ä¶..fresh calls available for cheap during a big spike . I sold AAPL and ETSY cheap and trimmed into mutuals .   - When Nasdaq crossed 12k I reversed and bought calls near term calls for the inverse ETFs on all broad indexes (FAZ, SQQQ, SARK, SRS)   I effectively made money on both sides testing this theory ‚Ä¶..although my technicals are certainly imperfect . I plan on rinse and repeating until June .   Thoughts ?,;,; 2023-03-22 21:08:50]

[Deciding REITS for my portfolio. But lack the confidence in knowing how to valuate each choice.,;,; Obviously I want the best to profit the most and don't want to waste time trying learn through experience unless I have the tools to do it efficiently.  I am trying to be a combination of investing types or styles. First is Core and Satellite Investing,  GARP Investing, and Passive Aggressive Investing.  My Portfolio so far is QQQM, AMZN, AAPL, and GLD.  The list of REITS I am trying to decide on adding to the portfolio is this  They all provide monthly dividends because of my preference.  * Realty Income Corporation (O) (I know O is popular choice with its consistent growing dividends) * Stag Industrial, Inc. (STAG) * EPR Properties (EPR) * LTC Properties, Inc. (LTC) * Global Net Lease, Inc. (GNL) * Gladstone Commercial Corporation (GOOD)  I have some google sheets made by someone online that I bought for cheap to find good stocks by different stock model valuations. But the person has a reit valuation model and a stock valuation model.  This makes me uncertain since I would want it to be O but I don't want to be bias because of the hype of a single stock.  From my REIT model GNL and GOOD are considered a buy. while the rest at the moment are considered a sell.  But compared to stock valuation O, STAG, EPR, and LTC are considered a buy  This leaves me uncertain is GNL and GOOD considered undervalued? or are both valuation models ineffective?  Then I try using finviz screener and STAG is the only one to show some good fundamentals.  What am I supposed to be looking at fundamentally?  Is there a difference for fundamentals for a reit versus a common stock?  I understand fundamentals as far as personal experience and having a major in finance. But I am seeking reassurance as for what values , ratios, and other data. I should be looking at to find profitable opportunities to buy.  &amp;#x200B;  This is what I have been told to pay attention to or learned online.  All of these fundamentals are from FINVIZ because that is my main stock screener.  P/E , PEG, P/S, P/B, Price/ cash, Price/FCFF, eps growth past 5 years, dividend yield, debt to equity, and operating margin.  I am seeking reassurance or help for me to understand this better. I am honestly just being lazy and just want to make sure I am learning the correct or important stuff.   &amp;#x200B;  edit: I learned a little bit of fundamentals but not much. It is just smarter to go towards the benchmark since a stock would not be capable of consistently beating the benchmark.  so this helped narrow down my choices with  new ones   &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2024-01-02 22:45:10]
[Tech stocks have completed their largest three-week surge since the early days of COVID in April 2020.,;,; Tech investors are entering the Thanksgiving season with optimism as the Nasdaq rises 2.4% in a week, marking a 12% gain over three weeks‚Äîthe strongest rally since April 2020. Intel stands out as the week's biggest winner among large-cap tech stocks, surging 13%, driven by robust demand for PCs following better-than-expected profit and sales reports. Mizuho Securities upgraded Intel to a buy rating, citing a renewed focus on the data center business and positive prospects in the customer pipeline.  Next week, the spotlight shifts to semiconductors, with Nvidia set to report results. The stock has surged 22% in three weeks, boasting a year-to-date gain of 237%, outpacing other S&amp;P 500 members. Nvidia's strong performance is attributed to its role in generative artificial intelligence, providing graphics processing units (GPUs) for powerful workloads. Analysts expect revenue growth of over 170% for Q3 and anticipate Nvidia's forecast to suggest close to 200% growth in Q4.  Eric Jackson, founder of EMJ Capital, considers Nvidia his "top large-cap name" and sees the tech market in the early stages of a rebound, linked to the potential end of Federal Reserve rate hikes. The market is sensitive to interest rates, with low costs encouraging risk-taking and higher rates directing investors to safer assets.  Tame U.S. inflation data, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) remaining flat in October, boosts the broader market. The week's large-cap gainers also include Tesla, rising 9.2%, despite CEO Elon Musk's controversial social media post.

[Question about long term investing for a new grad?,;,; Hey! So I‚Äôve been trading for about three years now.

[safe haven The stock market is red-eyed. At present, it is not only bank stocks but also energy stocks that are killing.,;,; Market commentary has pointed out that last year's big tech stocks are now safe havens. The five elephant stocks then bucked the trend and rose:  GOOGL 2.28%  META 1.92%  MSFT 1.78%  AMZN 1.39%  AAPL 0.26%  The auto industry is currently in a recession, and TSLA will be affected, so it has been a little weak recently.  Chip design duo AMD and NVDA have not been dragged down by semiconductors and bucked the trend today. INTC came back from failure, rising 9.35% in the first five trading days.  One strategy is to only buy stocks that have risen sharply rather than stocks that have fallen sharply, because from the lessons of last year, we can understand that thunderstorms have no bottom. Even META TSLA has experienced a collapse of more than 70% from its high point.

[How US stocks rose 20% from their lows, and where they might be going,;,; U.S. stocks have defied fears of a recession, a banking crisis and soaring Treasury yields to rise 20% from their October lows - one definition of a bull market.        The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index closed at a low of 3,577.03 on Oct. 12, 2022, down 25% from its all-time high after the Federal Reserve unleashed a series of bruising interest rate increases to fight decades-high inflation.        On Thursday, it closed up 0.6% at 4,293.93, amid growing optimism over the economic outlook and a rate hiking cycle that appears to be nearing its end. Here are some features of the index's rally, and a look at where stocks might go from here.  While markets seldom rise in a straight line, the S&amp;P 500's journey from the bottom took 164 days - the longest 20% climb from a bear market low in five decades. Among the factors holding stocks back was a surge in Treasury yields to their highest levels in decades that dulled the allure of equities by offering investors the potential to earn attractive income in government-backed bonds.        A crisis that saw the biggest bank busts since the Great Recession also shook investor confidence, as did worries over a potentially catastrophic fight over lifting the U.S. debt ceiling.  The narrow breadth of the S&amp;P 500's rally has been a concern for some investors, with just seven stocks - Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Microsoft (MSFT.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Meta (META.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O) - responsible for almost all of the index's gains this year. Many investors view these stocks as safe bets in uncertain times. Their gains were also driven by excitement over advances in artificial intelligence.  More recently, however, the market's gains have shown tentative signs of broadening out to other stocks.  Meanwhile, volatility has subsided - not only in stocks, but in Treasuries and currencies.        One reason for the calm in markets is investors' belief that the Fed is unlikely to deliver many more of the rate hikes that shook asset prices last year.        Investors have also been encouraged by evidence showing that the U.S. economy continues to be resilient in the face of the central bank's monetary tightening, while inflation slowly cools. The U.S. Citigroup Economic Surprise Index (.CESIUSD) shows U.S. economic data has in aggregate topped market expectations, helped by stronger than expected numbers for employment and consumer spending.        A 20% gain from bear market lows has in the past heralded further upside for stocks.  In four of the last six bear markets, the S&amp;P went on to rise 20% or more in the six months after hitting this milestone.  [  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-06-09 09:07:00]
[Should I buy different ETFs depending on the type of account? IRA account vs. Individual Investment account.,;,; My mother recently passed away, and I inherited two Fidelity accounts that she had. One of the accounts was her IRA account. The other was an individual investment account. After taking a look at both of them, I realized that she has a ton of money in bonds. This made sense for someone her age, but for me, I'd like to completely revamp these accounts since I'm 32 years with a much higher risk tolerance.    She also has a ton of different individual stocks (over 70 different individual stocks) that I'd like to consolidate and use mostly ETFs instead. I will post my portfolio plan of action below. My main question is, should I be focusing mainly on ETFs that are dividend driven for the IRA account? While focusing mainly on non-dividend ETFs for my investment account? I know that with IRA accounts, you do not get taxed on dividends as yearly income like you would for investment accounts. I plan on buying the following ETFs for my investment account.   50% VOO (ETF)- Vanguard 500 Index Fund - 500 largest companies.  15% VTI (ETF)- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund - Overall stock market.  10% AVUV (ETF)- Avantis US Small Cap Value -  US small-cap.  10% QQQ (ETF) - Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 - Invesco QQQ - Technology, NASDAQ top 100....Apple, Google, Microsoft, ect.  10% Individual Stocks - NVDA, META, AAPL, AMZN, MCD, TSLA, SHOP, etc.  5% XXUS (ETF)- VXUS-Vanguard Total International Stock ETF - ETF with international exposure.

[Microsoft stock hits a record high. Why its next move might be lower,;,; Microsoft stock reached a new all-time closing high‚Äîbut there could be some hiccups ahead in the short term.        Microsoft's stock rose 1.1% to $360.53 on Tuesday. That's a new closing high, topping the previous high of $359.49 set on July 18. Furthermore, Microsoft has won for eight days in a row, its longest winning streak since January 28, 2021.        The stock has been helped by the company‚Äôs strong earnings and sales, which got a boost from the Azure cloud business.        But it‚Äôs not just earnings. Microsoft was already outperforming its peers following tech weakness in August and September. Its stock has gained 15% since the end of September, outpacing Amazon.com (AMZN), which has risen 12%, Meta Platforms (META), which has risen 6.5%, Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), which is up 6%, Alphabet (GOOGL) which has ticked up 0.3%, and Tesla (TSLA), which has dropped 13%.        So, why be concerned? It all comes down to the 14-day relative strength index from Microsoft. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index, is a measure of a stock's or index's momentum, or lack thereof. The closer it comes to 20 on the negative, the more oversold it is, while a score close to 80 indicates that the stock is extremely overbought. A value below 30 usually indicates that a stock is about to rally, while a score above 60 indicates a likely decline. Microsoft's RSI is at 72.75, indicating that it is becoming quite overbought and that a pullback is possible.        That doesn‚Äôt mean Microsoft isn‚Äôt worth buying for its long-term potential. The company has a lot to recommend, including a cloud business that should get a boost as ChatGPT, which held its developer conference yesterday, looks to expand. It just means that investors might get a better opportunity to pick up shares in the days ahead.        ,;,; 2023-11-08 11:35:51]
[Seeking Advice on Reallocating Tech Stock Profits to IRA: Long-Term Gains vs. Retirement Planning,;,;   Hey fellow investors,  I've been holding onto tech stocks like Nvidia, Netflix Amazon, Apple, and a few others since 2017, and they've seen impressive returns ranging from 100% to over 1,000%. Currently, I have around $65,000 invested in these stocks on Robinhood.  Considering the incredible gains over the past seven to eight years, I'm contemplating whether it makes sense to sell some of these long-term holdings and redirect the profits into my IRA accounts. My IRAs have a balance of approximately $72,000, and this year, I lack the additional income to contribute to my retirement accounts.  The idea is to potentially diversify by moving some gains from individual tech stocks into more traditional investment vehicles, such as a target retirement fund, total stock market index fund or an S&amp;P 500 tracking fund within my IRA.  I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences on whether reallocating profits from high-performing tech stocks to retirement accounts is a prudent move, considering the current market conditions and the long-term benefits of retirement planning.  For some more context, I'm a 34 year old male with no major debt, I own a house with mortgage payments of about $1600 a month and about 190k in homeowners equity, and I have no car or student loan payments.  Some of my long term tech holdings are as follows:  NVDA - $28,000, 1300% return;  AMZN - $9,000, 137% return;  NFLX - $6,200, 220% return;  AAPL - $14,000, 340% return   I have some more small tech holdings totaling the rest.   Thanks in advance for your insights!,;,; 2023-12-29 00:50:28]

[Why I believe TJX, which reports earnings this week, is a good stock pick,;,; I am not a swing trader. I am 99% of the time an investor (current holdings in VOO, AAPL, UNH, WMT). There is one stock that I have been keeping track of the past few quarters since the average American is living paycheck to paycheck now more than ever... TJX (The TJX Companies, Inc.) is a good stock to pick up and one should consider doing so before Wednesday's earnings.   Here is a link to the Clevelend Research article about TJX being a good pick [   A few things I would add that the article did not cover: The PE and Forward PE of a company was something everyone used to discuss prior to the pandemic. Today people are beginning to realize a high PE is not what it used to be. The entire way companies are run is different. In the 1990s if a company had a high PE it was almost always because of having high debt, not having a good price point on products relative to consumer spending, etc. Today that is all out the window. Even with all of this in mind TJX only has a PE of 26 (Forward PE of 21). This stock is a good long term hold. Added 349 shares to my portfolio. ,;,; 2023-08-14 01:01:30]
[Is Tesla the Ultimate Investment? Garry Breaks Down the Numbers, Growth, and Unveils the EV Game-Changer!,;,; According to Garry, Investment advisor,Tesla ($TSLA) currently sits at $250 per share, trading at 58 times his estimated 2024 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $4.30. Garry's take on this? He believes it's a reasonable valuation, especially when considering the projected +28% increase in volume and an impressive +32% growth in EPS between now and 2030. This positions Tesla's Price/Earnings-to-Growth (PEG) ratio at 1.8x, notably lower than Apple's ($AAPL) 3.0x PEG.  Garry's outlook extends to global EV adoption, forecasting a rise from the current 13% to a substantial 60% by 2030, sporting a +24% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CGR). With faith in the Cybertruck and Tesla's $25,000 next-gen vehicle, Garry expects Tesla to boost its global EV market share from 16% to 20% by 2030. The outcome? Tesla's vehicle volumes surging from 1.8 million in 2023 to 2.4 million in 2024 and an impressive 10.2 million by 2030 (+28% CGR).  Factoring in aspects like auto gross margin expansion, contributions from energy, operating leverage, and cash reinvestment, Garry foresees Tesla's Adjusted EPS climbing from $3.20 in 2023 to $22 in 2030 (+32% CGR). Interestingly, Garry's projections don't include potential revenues from Full Self-Driving (FSD) licensing, robotaxi ventures, or other futuristic elements. However, they do consider FSD at a 15% global take rate and energy revenues rising by a factor of eight.  The central question, as per Garry's analysis, is whether a P/E ratio of 58x is too steep for the premier EV player, set to experience a +28% CGR in volume and +32% CGR in EPS. Garry challenges you to find another mega-cap stock with this level of growth and valuation, particularly with traditional automakers pulling back from their EV commitments. In his view, Tesla stands out as the primary investment opportunity in the evolving EV landscape.,;,; 2023-12-19 10:39:22]
[Dow Jones futures rise; a sale at Silicon Valley Bank closes; Microsoft, Tesla near buy points,;,; Dow Jones futures rose slightly Sunday night, along with S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The bank crisis is still in focus. Headlines have been relatively modest so far this weekend, though a deal may be close for FDIC-controlled Silicon Valley Bank.  A stock market rally attempt is ongoing, but the indexes have been volatile while breadth has been narrow.  The major indexes rose modestly for the week, but came far off weekly highs. The Russell 2000 hit 2023 lows with bank stocks, but small caps and banks edged up for the week.  The rally attempt has relied heavily on big-cap Nasdaq stocks. Apple stock, ¬†Microsoft ($MSFT), Tesla ($TSLA), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals ($REGN), MercadoLibre ($MELI) and Palo Alto Networks ($PANW) are Nasdaq 100 stocks that are holding up well.  REGN stock gapped up into a buy zone late in the week on positive drug trial news. Apple ($AAPL) and Microsoft are just above buy points while Palo Alto is just below an entry. MercadoLibre and Tesla stock are holding key support levels, not far from being actionable. All boast strong relative strength lines. MercadoLibre and PANW stock are on IBD Leaderboard. AAPL stock is on SwingTrader. MSFT stock is on the IBD Long-Term Leaders list. MELI stock is on the IBD 50.   Just because individual stocks are possible buys doesn't mean investors have to act on them. This market rally attempt still needs to confirm its uptrend.   ## Bank News  This weekend has been relatively quiet for banking news, at least in comparison to the prior two weekends. The news generally has been about resolution vs. frantic efforts to avoid systemic collapse.  First Citizens BancShares is in advanced talks to buy SVB Financial's Silicon Valley Bank, Bloomberg reported Sunday evening.  The FDIC has been looking to unload Silicon Valley Bank since taking over more than two weeks ago. Reports last week suggested that the regulator might shoulder some of the underwater assets to smooth the way for a deal.  U.S. regulators could expand an emergency lending facility for banks, with an aim at helping First Republic bolster its balance sheet, Bloomberg reported Saturday, citing sources. Authorities are mulling various options. They don't see any First Republic as needing urgent new help as the California-based bank tries to work out solutions with its advisers.  Late Friday, the Fed reported that deposits at small domestically chartered banks fell by $120 billion in the week March 15, but rose $67 billion at large domestically chartered banks.  On Friday, many banks rebounded from 2023 lows after concerns expanded, at least briefly, to Deutsche Bank. Even Wall Street giants such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley undercut recent lows before closing better.  The video embedded in this article discusses the week's market action in depth, while also analyzing MELI stock as well Meritage Homes and PagerDuty, the two most recent IBD Stock Of The Day selections.

[What is your process for discovering/reviewing stocks?,;,; I've been trading for a couple of years and lately I've been doing very well by paying attention to relationships and divergences among stocks/ETFs/commodities. Trying to understand and exploit the ebb and flow among sectors. Attempting to identify where long-term accumulation is taking place. First and foremost I watch SPY/QQQ/IWM, ES/NQ/RTY, VIX/VX, DXY/USD, and the 10Y. I also watch the SPDR Sector Funds like XLK, XLF, XLV, XLU, XLY, XLE, XLP, XBI, etc. Additionally, IWC (micro-caps) and IJH (mid-caps).   And VTI (whole stock market ETF) and VT (whole world market ETF) I watch on the weekly chart to get a sense for where the world markets are trending in general. I haven't branched into other markets much, mainly focused on identifying   1) where the current strength in the market is   2) whether the market is remaining orderly/non-volatile   3) how much divergence is taking place among sectors/stocks (e.g. last year felt like indiscriminate selling, this year the divergences are tremendous)  For individual stocks, I basically rifle through stocks with setups that interest me and I really lack organization for what I have on my charts during a trading day. I use Thinkorswim and typically have about 20 charts up across 3 monitors. It's been a challenge to manage my screen real estate and I still change things up all the time, haven't found a solid methodology I guess for what I have pulled up. Undoubtedly what you have pulled up can effect what you trade, how you perceive the market throughout the day, etc.   A lot of times I have AAPL, TSLA, GOOG, AMZN, up at all times. From there I have a mix of stocks from other sectors, maybe a couple wildcards like a small cap/squeeze name. But generally my goal is to display to myself options that I'm unlikely to be severely wrong on, or end up taking a big loss on. I go through and adjust what I'm looking to every night, but admittedly I do need more organization, journaling, and operating more systematically.    So what is your process for evaluating the market? Discovering stocks and setups. What do you have open during the trading day? How many charts? Do you purposefully limit what you see? Do you use any websites/tools to organize your watchlist(s)? Give me your wisdoms,;,; 2023-07-04 18:57:31]

[Will Apple be a $4 trillion dollar stock by 2024?,;,; * Apple‚Äôs market cap rose from $1 trillion in 2018 to $3 trillion in 2022. * Reaching the $4 trillion market cap by 2024 could be very challenging. * New products, services, and acquisitions could help it reach that milestone.      # The law of large numbers hasn't caught up to Apple yet.   Apple ($AAPL) became the first publicly traded U.S. company to hit a $1 trillion market cap in August 2018. It also became the first to cross the $2 trillion mark in August 2020, and the first to reach the $3 trillion milestone in January 2022.        Apple's market cap is still hovering near the $3 trillion mark as of this writing, but could it maintain its biennial tradition and hit a $4 trillion market cap by 2024? Let's review its past growth, projected growth rates, and valuations to decide.  # How did Apple become a $3 trillion company?   Between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2022 (which ended last September), Apple's annual revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5%. Meanwhile, its split-adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew at an even higher CAGR of 21.6%.        In other words, Apple's annual EPS nearly tripled from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2022 -- so it makes sense that its stock price nearly quadrupled over the past five years. However, Apple's valuations have also risen at a faster rate than its actual profits. On the last day of fiscal 2017, Apple's stock traded at $154.12 ($38.53 on a split-adjusted basis), which was only 13 times the diluted EPS of $11.91 it would generate in fiscal 2018. Today, Apple trades at 28 times forward earnings.  Apple's path from $1 trillion to $3 trillion was paved by both its own EPS growth and its rising valuations. Its earnings growth was driven by its robust sales of iPhones (which still account for over half its revenue), iPads, Macs, and the expansion of its services segment with more subscription-based services. Its valuations rose as more investors turned to Apple as a safe-haven bet while the pandemic, the Russo-Ukrainian war, inflation, and rising interest rates rattled the broader markets.   Apple's EPS also usually grows at a faster clip than its net income because it buys back billions of dollars in shares every year. It repurchased 19% of its shares over the past five years, as well as a whopping 38% of its shares over the past decade.  #  How could Apple become a $4 trillion company?   For Apple to reach a $4 trillion market cap by the end of 2024, its stock would need to rise nearly 40% over the next 18 months. That could be quite difficult, for two simple reasons.        First, analysts expect Apple's EPS to dip 2% in fiscal 2023, rise 9% in fiscal 2024, and grow 10% to $7.17 per share in fiscal 2025. Assuming Apple still trades at 28 times forward earnings by the beginning of fiscal 2025, its stock would only be trading 9% higher at about $200 -- which would give it a market cap of just under $3.2 trillion.        Second, Apple's valuations are historically high -- so I could see its forward multiple drop back to 20 during a market downturn. If that happens, Apple's stock could decline to the mid-$140s, and its market cap would shrink to about $2.2 trillion.  # Pay attention to the wild cards  Based on analysts' estimates, should take with a grain of salt, it seems unlikely that Apple will reach a $4 trillion valuation by the end of 2024. However, those forecasts don't account for all the wild cards that Apple can still play.         Apple's upcoming rollout of the Vision Pro headset in early 2024 will mark its first major hardware launch since its introduction of the Apple Watch in 2015. Its high price tag of $3,500 might limit its initial appeal, but a stronger-than-expected launch could drive analysts to boost their revenue and earnings estimates.        Apple also ended its latest quarter with 975 million paid subscriptions across all of its services, which represented 18% growth from a year ago. That massive audience gives it plenty of room to launch new apps and services.        Lastly, Apple is still sitting on $166 billion in cash and marketable securities. It could deploy a lot of that cash on fresh investments and acquisitions (perhaps on media companies for its services ecosystem or some chipmakers for its first-party chips).   # Look beyond Apple's market cap   I believe Apple will eventually be worth $4 trillion one day, but I don't expect it to reach that milestone by the end of 2024. Instead, investors should simply recall that Apple generates stable growth, commands fierce customer loyalty, locks in its customers with sticky services, and rewards its patient investors with buybacks and dividends. All of those strengths make Apple a great long-term investment -- regardless of how much the entire company is actually worth.,;,; 2023-06-20 10:28:39]
[Tracking the "chart master" for October,;,; So just for fun I'm going to plant this stake in the ground with television's "chart master" Carter Worth's call from last week.  I track him and others regularly, and though his methods are amusing, I'll be darned if he doesn't have a pretty good track record.  So I'll post this and track it over the next month to see how it plays out.  He cited his common theme of looking for sector charts that have risen too much, and swapping them for those that have fallen too much.  Simplistic, but whatever.  His call for October was that energy especially had been straight up uncorrected, and was time to "take measures" meaning sell, short, raise cash, take profit.  Same with tech.    His oversold sectors to deploy the capital from those are Financials, health care, staples and utilities.   Based on emphasis, he was essentially saying swap your energy stocks for financials.,;,; 2023-10-02 21:41:07]
[Biggest threat for Google ... Apple. Opinion on the two frenemies,;,; Disclaimer, I have a postion in Google and do not hold Apple directly (but I do trough BerkshireB/S&amp;P), so my opinion may be biased.  While I think the underlying business of Google is incredibly good, I have the feeling that it moat is getting smaller. I expect growth from its cloud services, YouTube, and maybe some of Google bets might play out (Pixel phones, robotaxies, chromebooks if they stop sucking...) , but we all know that the most profitable part of Google business is its search engine.  Know, while Microsoft might try to eat Googles pie and is probably its main competitor over most segments, especially Bing/Chatgpt vs Chrome/Bard, Outlook vs Gmail, M.Teams vs G.meet and so on, I think the biggest treat is actually Apple.  Right know Google is paying a big undisclosed amount (probably around 20 bln $ a year ) to be the default search engine on Apple devices, where a lot of Google searches (from the most valuable well off users) come from. The idea that Apple could raise the price of the deal by a lot or start promoting its own search engine is quite terrifing. It would be a risky move for them (losing 10s of blns a year for doing effectively nothing, and coming up with a search engine on their own that gives satisfactory results) but given Apples pivot toward services and its insane customer loyalty it might not be that crazy after all.  Android has a biggest market share, but these people have a lower capacity/willingness to spend, so it doesn't really matters that much. If I had to rate Google search traffic, I would say that the one coming from Android users is the safest (and probably the least profitable), the one coming from Windows PC is still relatively safe (despite bing being default and intagrated with Chatgpt), and the one coming from iOS is the one most at risk, and unfortunately for Google the most profitable.

[US stocks take a breather, Nasdaq notches its fifth straight month of gains: Investors gear up for pivotal week,;,; The U.S. stock market has started the week on a lackluster note, with all indices hovering around Friday's closing values. Traders are adopting a more cautious approach as they await crucial events scheduled for the week. The market will be heavily influenced by significant earnings reports, such as Apple's AAPL+ Free Alerts and Amazon's AMZN+ Free Alerts on Thursday, and crucial macroeconomic data, such as PMI readings and the highly anticipated jobs report set to be released on Friday.        The Nasdaq 100 Index is on track for its sixth month of advances, with the last such streak occurring between April and August 2020. The major three indices, the S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and the Dow, inched 0.1% higher, while small caps in the Russell 2000 outperformed by rising 0.9%. The Russell 2000 index is also approaching its 2023 highs at 2,007 points hit on February.        The heartening aspect of the market upside is the broader participation, and LPL Financial's Chief Technical Strategist Adam Turnquist said technicals confirm the development. The relative performance of the average stock is building, and the market's advance/decline line traded at a new 52-week high. Nearly 75% of the S&amp;P 500 stocks were trading above their 200-day moving average, with cyclical sectors seeing the highest percentages among sector peers. International stocks were also participating in the year's rally, with most major global benchmarks now in bull market territory.        In midday trading on Monday, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust was flat at $457, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF was unchanged at $354, and the Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ+ Free Alerts held steady at $383. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE outperformed, rising 1.9%, while the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund XLV was the laggard, down 1.1%.        Latest economic data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas's manufacturing sector general business activity index hit a four-month high of -20.0 in July 2023, marking the second consecutive monthly increase. However, the production index remained reasonably constant at -4.8, indicating a small drop in output. The Federal Reserve will release the results of its loan office survey at 4 p.m. EDT.

[Apple's mixed reality headset announcement sends Unity stock soaring,;,; Unity Software (U) stock soared on Monday, rising nearly 20% into the close after a shoutout during Apple's (AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference.        Unity's gaming software will be used in Apple's new mixed reality headset, the Apple Vision Pro, Apple announced on Monday.  "We know there is a community of developers who have been building incredible 3D apps for years," Apple's vice president of worldwide developer relations said during the WWDC presentation. And today we are excited to share that we've been working with Unity to bring those apps to Vision Pro. So popular Unity-based games and apps can gain full access to vision OS features such as pass-through, high-resolution renderings, and native gestures."        **Volume in Unity stock shot up to more than triple the 20-day moving average as the stock had its best intraday performance since November 10.**  Unity operates a cross-platform game engine that was first discussed at an Apple WWDC in 2005 in regard to the Mac. The company went public in 2020 and the stock was bought up to nearly $200 a share during the 2021 tech surge in stocks. Ark Innovation Founder Cathie Wood is a shareholder. Unity is the 15th largest holding in Ark's flagship fund, the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) and represents 3.46% of the total portfolio.       On May 10, Unity reported first-quarter earnings that beat Street estimates for revenue while posting a wider-than-expected loss per share. **Unity reported first-quarter revenue of $500.36 million compared to Wall Street estimates of $477.67**. Unity's adjusted earnings per share loss of $0.09 was more than $0.01 the Street had been expecting.        Like others in the gaming sector, Unity spent its first-quarter earnings call positioning itself as an AI winner.        "AI is going to have a profound effect on the industry," Unity CEO John S. Riccitiello said on the company's earnings call. "First, it's going to lead to inflection up in growth as game types are built that were no longer ‚Äî were not previously possible. And secondly, we're going to see, I believe, some of the crazy expense that goes on in some high-end production come down some. It's a favorable part of the game industry for growth. And I guess it'd be very favorable for Unity as we drive some of these changes through the industry.",;,; 2023-06-06 10:48:35]
[Shareholders Adore Apple! Value Exceeds $3T,;,; The value of Apple is starting to rise towards the historic record of $3 trillion, which it has already surpassed once in history. This is likely happening in connection with the recent WWDC 2023, where promising products such as Vision Pro were introduced. However, the hot news of this AR/VR headset is not what drives up the company's stock price. Mark Gurman offers a different explanation.     **Why Are Investors Not Showing Interest In Vision Pro?**   [**Apple**]( touched the $3 trillion mark at the beginning of 2022. Now it is approaching it again, and ***Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman***, who has long focused on [Apple‚Äôs business strategy]( provides an analysis that reveals the reasons behind this trend. At first glance, it may seem that investors believe in the revolutionary Vision Pro headset, but the opposite is true.   AR/VR glasses like Vision Pro will not become as popular as iPhones or MacBooks when they are launched. The high price, impractical external battery, and the still unclear practical use of this headset will be the cause. Apple is aware of this, as are the investors who rely on other products.  **What Drives The Increase In Stock Prices?**   As the first reason, Gurman mentions Apple‚Äôs user interface. The integration of all mobile devices, tablets, watches, and the availability of music and video subscriptions on every product is extremely convenient, making it hard to leave this ecosystem. In the case of Apple, customers are simply willing to pay extra for the luxury that the brand offers.   Another aspect is the fact that a new series of iPhones, the [**iPhone 15**]( will be released in the fall, bringing more significant changes and new features after a while. Investors expect that the new models will attract many customers, driving the company‚Äôs value upward.,;,; 2023-07-02 06:47:16]

[Is QQQ a better investment than SF Bay Area SFHs?,;,; I posted this on r/RealEstate too but I guess it's a different population there. Today I saw a post that kinda make me regret buying a home in the Bay Area in 2021. Basically the post claimed:  1. Cupertino, CA SFHs are strongly related to APPL stock price. Same as SF Bay Area housing price strongly related to QQQ price. 2. Cupertino Median SFH price went from 1.41m in 02/2013 to 2.45m in 02/2023, which is a 1m net increase. Assume we bought it with 280k downpayment and 6.3k monthly mortgage. 3. In Cupertino, 3 bedroom rent price has been around 4k in the past ten years. If we had choose to rent, put in that 280k downpayment in APPL stock back in 2013, and use the 2.3k monthly cash flow to invest in APPL, we would have ended up with a yearly return rate of 25%.  Since bay area housing price is strongly related to tech stocks, does this mean people should rent in the bay area?  Now I am feeling very bad about putting down a lot of cash in a 1.2m townhouse back in 2021, although at the time I thought it was a deal since the comparables sold for 1.35m.

[Will the Cash App be the savior for Block struggling quarter?,;,;  Block Inc. ($SQ), whose Cash App is among the world's top 10 payment apps, will probably report a seventh consecutive quarter of net losses as revenue growth settles at a rate below its pre-pandemic norm.    ### KEY TAKEAWAYS  * Block will likely report a first-quarter loss of -$0.18 per share vs. -$0.38 per share a year earlier. * Revenue is predicted to climb more than 16% to $4.6 billion. * Block's gross payment volume is expected to climb 17% to nearly $51 billion.  Block is forecast to post net losses of $111.8 million, or 18 cents a share, narrower than losses of over $207 million a year earlier, according to analyst estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Analysts also predict revenue increased 16.5% year-over-year to $4.6 billion.1 Block reports earnings results after markets close Thursday.2  Block's transaction volumes surged in the second half of 2020 as e-commerce business swelled, but inflation and fears of a recession have quelled this rapid growth. Block's gross payment volume hasn't shrunk since 2020, but year-over-year growth has slowed from a peak of 88% in the second quarter of 2021 to 15% last quarter.  Block's Cash App is one of its primary growth drivers, and analysts expect revenue to top $2.8 billion, up from $2.5 billion a year ago.  CEO Jack Dorsey will likely face questions about a March 2023 report from short-seller Hindenburg Research accusing Block of inflating Cash App user counts.3 Block pushed back after the report was published, calling it "factually inaccurate and misleading."4  Dorsey could also report on efforts to expand Cash App's banking products, including the savings accounts it launched in January.5 The company and competitors like Apple ($AAPL) are adding traditional banking services to their platforms in an effort to retain users and become their primary banks.

[Will this Backtest work in the real world?,;,;  I was recently inspired by Charlie Munger and decided to use his philosophy of inversion to build a back test. The question I asked myself is what makes a bad investment? To that I answered:   * They take on a lot of debt which adds risk to the company if things go wrong. * They give away the company to employees or in acquisitions diluting existing owners. * They don‚Äôt grow * Earnings don‚Äôt arrive in cash * They have a business model that can easily be recreated * They sell at a high price     To make a good company I reasoned I want to invert the bad company metrics. To model these factors I back tested through Portfolio 123 by ranking the following data:   * They take on a lot of debt which adds risk to the company if things go wrong.    * Low Debt to Assets: Reviewed Quarterly    * High Interest Coverage: implies debt load can be covered by earnings * They give away the company to employees or in acquisitions diluting existing owners.    * Low Equity Dilution: Kinda obvious * They don‚Äôt grow    * High Sales Per Share Growth * Earnings don‚Äôt arrive in cash    * High Free Cash Flow per Share Growth    * High Operating Cash Flow Growth per Share: Companies showing an upward trend in cash flow growth are preferred, as this signals ongoing operational success and growth, avoiding those that have become static. * They have a business model that can easily be recreated    * High Average Gross Margins: High gross margins suggest a company can add a lot of value to the raw materials or by the info they have. Economic theory would suggest if others could do the same, the price charged would not be that much higher than the inputs. * They sell at a high price    * High Yield of Gross Profit to Market Cap: Going down an income statement or cash flow has messier and messier financials. Focusing on the top level should give a cleaner Yield and I believe would allow for better valuation of earlier stage companies.      Here were the results:     [  * The back test tab selects the higher ranked securities and market cap weights them subject to a 6% max weight and owns 100 stocks at a time from the Russell 1000 index. * The Ranking Score Tab shows an equal weighted average annualized return.    Portfolio123 adjusted for look ahead bias and delisted securities and all that.    The big question of course is, does anyone think this will work in the real world? To me it‚Äôs a very intuitive strategy and has promise. I would like to hear your thoughts and in particular connect why my assumptions of what a bad company and good company is could be wrong.    Other Fun Facts:  * Top performer in backtest: NVDA, been held for over 3,000 days * Top 10 Holdings Currently: NVDA, AAPL, STLD, LRCX, NUE, FAST, V, SNPS, TXN, KLAC    Disclosure: I own NVDA and V (unfortunately not for the past 3000 days.),;,; 2023-12-08 00:55:11]
[What should I focus on when evaluating a stock if I want to be somewhat conservative?,;,; I recently read an article in Forbes titled "Investment Advice From The Vietnam Veteran Who Turned A 2-Bedroom House Into A $4.7 Billion Fortune" about Arte Moreno and his response to one of their questions made me curious:  &gt;**Forbes: What assets are you buying in this environment?**  &gt;Moreno: There are some stocks in the market right now I like. They get banged up, but I like the asset and you can average down if you look at it that way. Pretty much everything I deal with has some type of return on it; some kind of dividend. If you look back a year ago, we had very low interest rates, like zero. So when you're looking at a stock and not only do you really like the asset, but then they're giving you a dividend, it‚Äôs such a bonus. You're setting yourself up for potential stock growth, but you're also receiving 3% to 4% annually.  &gt; I really try to stay by the book: I like to buy companies at around 15 times price-to-earnings. I have a couple strong positions in Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple (AAPL). I've been buying Apple forever; every time it goes down, I buy more Apple. I also buy JPMorgan (JPM), which pays about 3% dividend. Another company I really like, and have been invested in for a long time, is Blackstone (BX). The multiple doesn‚Äôt fit in there because it's high, but I just like their whole portfolio of assets.  &gt; I‚Äôm really pretty good about keeping diversified. But I really look at stocks that give you a good dividend. I look at a company that's not generating any cash, has no dividend and has this crazy high PE multiple, and I just stay away. I think it's for other people. It's not for me.  He considers himself a fairly conservative and by the book investor, so I was interested in learning more about how you guys evaluate a stock and what you think of his approach.  For example, one stock that I've been looking at off and on for quite a while now, but don't own, is POSCO (PKX).  They're currently at a 9.32 PE, which is below the 15x that Arte Moreno looks for, but they have a 3.90% dividend and they're generating cash. Is that info enough to make an investment or do you look for more?  Thank you for any help you can provide. I'm genuinely interested in learning more about investing. I have a couple funds for retirement, but I was considering adding another account at Vanguard to invest in maybe 4-5 companies I like once I learn more.,;,; 2023-06-02 04:12:42]

[Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..),;,; From     The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the "magnificent seven" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.  The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.  The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to "address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights."  The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.  The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.   How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted? The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.  The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.  The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.  Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.  Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.  Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.  Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.  Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.  How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut? Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.  Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.  The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.  Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023 The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.  This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.  There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.  Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices? The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.  However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&amp;P 500, which is why S&amp;P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.  The S&amp;P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.  Most of the "magnificent 7" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.  The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.  Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.,;,; 2023-07-10 20:25:37]
[Apple opens its first store in India as it looks for a new generation of iPhone users,;,; [  [Apple]( on Tuesday opened its first store in India, highlighting the importance of the market to the iPhone maker‚Äôs future.  The first store, called Apple BKC, is located in the populous city of Mumbai. Apple on Thursday will open another store in the capital of Delhi.  The Cupertino giant said it has been present in India for more than 25 years.  ‚ÄúIndia has such a beautiful culture and an incredible energy, and we‚Äôre excited to build on our long-standing history,‚Äù Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a press release published Monday.  Cook posted a photo of himself and staff at the new apple store on Monday.  Apple is aiming to boost sales and manufacturing of iPhones in India in a move analysts say resembles its strategy when it first entered China, now one of the company‚Äôs biggest markets.  Apple claims its Mumbai store is ‚Äúone of the most energy-efficient‚Äù locations in the world and has a dedicated solar energy system and has zero reliance on fossil fuels for the store‚Äôs operations. Apple BKC runs on 100% renewable energy, Apple said.  Cook has long viewed India as a key market to Apple‚Äôs future and in February he said he was ‚Äúbullish‚Äù on the world‚Äôs fifth-largest economy and the company is putting a ‚Äúsignificant amount of energy‚Äù into the market. Cook traveled to India for the opening of the store, [nearly seven years after his first visit as Apple CEO](  India‚Äôs smartphone market, however, has been dominated in recent years by Samsung and Chinese brands such as [Xiaomi]( with low-to-mid-tier priced devices finding support from customers in a price-sensitive market. Apple has very little market share in India.  But India is undergoing a ‚Äúpremiumification of market,‚Äù according to Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research. Smartphones priced above $400 now account for 10% of the total volumes of handsets shipped versus 4% before the pandemic, according to Shah. He said this category of smartphones accounts for 35% of total smartphone market revenue.  ‚ÄúApple as usual has got the timing right on ‚Äòpeaking at the right time‚Äô with its flagship store strategy to catalyse this trend in its favour,‚Äù Shah told CNBC via email.  India has a growing middle class, a young and ‚Äúmobile first‚Äù population willing to pay more for phones, especially in Mumbai and Delhi, two of the country‚Äôs wealthiest cities and the location of the new Apple stores.  ## iPhone sales in focus  Apple‚Äôs India push offers the opportunity for the U.S. technology giant to boost revenue and iPhone sales near the levels seen in markets like the U.S. and China, analysts said.  Apple shipped about 6.5 million iPhones in India in 2022, compared to around 50 million each year in both the U.S. and China, according to Counterpoint Research. Shah said India ‚Äúhas the potential to reach that scale‚Äù in the coming years.  Shipments refer to the iPhones Apple sends to retailers but do not equal sales. However, it is an indicator of the demand for iPhones in a country.  Apple made $6 billion in revenue in the year through to March, growing 50%, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter.  Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said that could rise further over the next two years.  ‚ÄúApple is now aggressively looking at India from both a production and retail expansion over the coming years that we believe will be a strategic poker move for Cupertino that could ramp annual revenue to $20 billion by 2025 in India,‚Äù Ives said in a note published Tuesday.  But it‚Äôs not just about selling iPhones. Apple‚Äôs strategy over the years has involved getting users locked into its suite of products including the Apple Watch and services like Apple Music.  ‚ÄúApple can cross sell other products such as Macs, Watch, AirPods, iPads and services to the growing iPhone user base maximising the revenue opportunity,‚Äù Shah said.  ## Manufacturing push  For Apple, India also represents a key part of its manufacturing strategy for the future.  Apple¬†[began assembling its flagship iPhone 14 in India](¬†last year ‚Äî the first time that the company has produced its latest device in the country, so close to its initial launch. Piyush Goyal, India‚Äôs minister of commerce and industry,¬†said in January that Apple is aiming to make 25% of all of its iPhones in India.  Part of the move in India is tied to the government‚Äôs push to bring high-tech manufacturing to the country. But Apple is also trying to diversify its assembly of products away from China. Supply chain fragilities in the world‚Äôs second-largest economy were exposed during the Covid pandemic and the strict measures Beijing took to control the outbreak.  [Production was disrupted](¬†last year at Apple‚Äôs biggest iPhone factory, located in Zhengzhou, China, by a [Covid outbreak](¬†and¬†[worker protests]( That factory is run by the Taiwanese firm Foxconn.  Wedbush‚Äôs Ives said Apple‚Äôs India strategy ‚Äî with both a retail and manufacturing push ‚Äî mirrors the technology giant‚Äôs steps it took in the China market 10 years ago.  ‚ÄúAs Foxconn/Apple put more skin in the game on the iPhone production front within India this will go hand in hand with a bigger retail presence within India as seen this week which mirrors the early days of the China penetration strategy going back a decade,‚Äù Iva said.  ‚ÄúRome was not built overnight and neither will Apple‚Äôs broader India strategy, however, we view this week as Apple diving into the deep end of the pool in India as this massive market slowly converts into the Apple ecosystem over the coming years with iPhone market share gains front and center.‚Äù,;,; 2023-04-18 14:24:41]

And while the aforementioned stars of this year's rally are still playing a leading role, a surge in oil prices has brought Energy (XLE) into the fold with cyclical sectors like Materials (XLB) and Industrials (XLI) also sitting on gains north of 14% since June as optimism about the economy abounds.  This has left all sectors with the exception of Health Care (XLV) and Utilities (XLU) sitting on year-to-date gains through July.  Combine this broad strength with the bullish year-to-date seasonality stats we've been compiling and the final five months of the year have some powerful tailwinds. Notably, however, Tuesday brings us into August, which has been the weakest month of the year over the last 25 years.  [**Broadening of the market.**](  In the table above, we can see that the three leading sectors until May were those that house the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, as well as the growthier names that tend to be less cyclical.  The Tech sector is home to much of the artificial intelligence trade, including Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA). Apple (AAPL), which is up some 50% so far this year, is also a member of the Tech sector.  Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), along with Meta Technologies (META), is a member of the Communication Services sector.  And even with the rally broadening in recent months, we can see Tech is still doing a lot of the heavy lifting. It may not be a surprise, then, to learn that both Apple and Meta have been positive each month this year. (For Meta, the streak of monthly wins extends all the way back to November 2022.)  Through May, Amazon (AMZN) and other e-commerce plays were primarily responsible for boosting gains in the Consumer Discretionary sector.  In the two months since, brick and mortar stalwarts like Kohl's (KSS) and Nordstrom (JWN) have joined the rally, with each up over 50% since the end of May.  Cyclical names ‚Äî whose fortunes vary more alongside the state of the economy ‚Äî dominate the components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI).  And inside the index we can also see the game of catch-up taking place.  The latest returns from June to July are reflected on the x-axis in the chart below, while prior gains through May are expressed vertically on the y-axis.  Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) is alone at the right edge of the chart ‚Äî up 29% the last two months after sinking 14% earlier this year. Caterpillar will report earnings on Tuesday.  3M (MMM) and Boeing (BA) are also among top recent returns, while rounding out the top five are banking giant JPMorgan (JPM) and retail leader Home Depot (HD).  Also noteworthy are the few laggards that haven't mustered much the entire year and are camping out in the lower left of the chart.  Consumer Staples (XLP) company Walgreens (WBA) happens to be dead last on the year-to-date list, down 20%. Telecom company Verizon (VZ) and pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) are also toward the bottom.,;,; 2023-08-01 02:38:08]

[Keep portfolio / Sell portfolio and put all into Term Deposits. What would you do?,;,; Hi guys! I'm looking for some advice / points of view on something. For the last couple of weeks i've been thinking and thinking what i should do with my portfolio / investment strategy. So, I'm from Europe, and i currently have some money invested into the US market + some spare money (I'll show the percentages below). Right know, i have some spare money and i have the possibility to it into some Term deposits with maturity from 1 month, up to 3 years, which i think pays out quite good or just keep DCA into the market.  Ok so first, my portfolio right now is still positive overall and it looks like this: VOO - 25%, QQQ - 18%, NVDA - 12%, AAPL - 11%, MSFT - 10%, GOOGL - 7%, RKLB - 3%, UNH - 3% and the rest 11% split into V, ASTS, MA, HD, AMZN, TGT, DIS, BA and TSLA. For the past year or so, i didn't add anything to individual stocks and just DCA into VOO/QQQ every month.  Now, the banks right now have these interests (i've selected from different banks, the best ones for each maturity period): 1 month - 5.7%, 3 months - 7.3%, 6 months - 7.5%, 1 year - 8.2%, 2 years - 8.45%, 3 years - 8.7%. But before you say holy s\*\*t, these are good returns, right now, here, the inflation rate is at 15% (which in reality i think it's even worse), so it's not that great if you look at it that way.  Looking at the market right now, 7.5% or 8.2% seems pretty good. I know the market average return is around 8% to 9% but I'm not sure the market is gonna have these kind of returns (at least the next few years?). But i could be right, i could be wrong of course. I just don't feel like it's gonna do great next period, that's all.  So now back to my dilemma... As i said, for the past year i just DCA each month into VOO/QQQ. Besides what's already invested, i have some spare cash i would like to deploy right now and i see these scenarios.  \- Sell the portfolio, and put it all + spare money + new money each month into term deposits (6 months or 1 year maturity)  \- Keep portfolio as it is and put spare money + new money each month into term deposits  \- Keep portfolio and put the spare money into it + DCA each month as usual and ignore the term deposits  If i missed something, maybe a better option or some information that i missed and might be really important to take into consideration, please tell me. Right now i'm something like 60/40 into second scenario. Just don't touch the portfolio, but put the rest of the money into these deposits (i was thinking the 1 year one may be the best one ?), until the market stabilizes a bit. Also, im in my twenties, so my investment hold period is long. I don't need the money any time soon (that's 1 of the reason why i think the option to keep DCA into the market may be better because of the compound interest?).  I could really use some advice on this guys. What would you do in this situation? Sorry if some terms are not right or something, as im not from US, some things related to investing may be different and i might wrongly translate them. Thanks a lot guys!  TLDR: You have spare money right now. How you choose to use it? Sell portfolio and put everything into Term deposits (at least for the next couple of years) / Keep portfolio and put rest into Term deposits / Ignore the Term deposits and keep DCA into the market as usual.,;,; 2023-03-13 16:09:59]
[Google (GOOG) DCF Analysis,;,; **NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**  # Introduction:  GOOG has a very simplistic goal in their business, yet this simple goal managed to carry GOOG's market cap to a trillion dollar. GOOG's main business model is centered around helping consumers sieve through large chunks of data to find what they need or want to find. Recently, with the announcement of Gemini, GOOG's GenAI, it led to a temporary spike in stock prices as investors believed that Gemini would be able to compete with ChatGPT. I believe that the advancement of GenAI is necessary for GOOG given how reliant they are on Search revenue.  # Revenue:  The success of GOOG‚Äôs advertising is hinged on 2 criteria, being able to attract and retain users and being able to monetize advertisers.  ***For attracting and retaining users,***  1. GOOG released Gemini their generative AI to help complement Search. This allows users to process information faster or seek answers more efficiently. 2. GOOG has entered into a deal with AAPL to make Google the default search engine on Safari. This deal is estimated to be worth about 18 billion per year. 3. There is a large switching cost for long-term users to switch over to a rival search engine. This is so because using the Google search engine means that there is a high chance users will be indoctrinated into the GOOG ecosystem (E.g. Gmail, Google Drive, etc.).  ***For monetizing advertisers,***  1. GOOG is one of the largest platforms that advertisers can advertise on. The type of information that users receive is dependent on GOOG, GOOG controls the information flow to consumers and hence is a powerful platform for advertisers to advertise on.  Apart from these factors, GOOG has begun targeting SMBs (Small and Midsize Businesses).  How GOOG sees SMBs (Small, Medium Businesses) advertising with them is that GOOG will provide Gen AI to generate images/captions for their ad campaign then SMBs use these advertising materials and advertise on Search.  When forecasting advertising revenue, opting for less granularity, and due to a lack of public data, I lumped both search and YouTube together. Taking the number of YouTube users as a proxy for the popularity of GOOG‚Äôs advertising tools.  So, I assumed that it would take 1 year for GOOG to finish and get Gemini up to speed. I assumed that it takes about 2 years for consumers to get used to Gemini and for advertisers to notice this shift. This quick adaptation is because ChatGPT took off very quickly within the year it was released.  When forecasting revenue/users, due to the macro constraints and pessimism advertisers are cautious about advertising so the revenue/users have been dropping for the past 2 years. I assume it takes 2 years for the macro outlook to improve and during the high growth period, revenue/users grow as well as more advertisers start spending more.  &amp;#x200B;  When forecasting Google Subscriptions + Others, which entails YouTube premium, GOOG devices, and Google Play revenue. I assumed that the success of this category is based on YouTube Premium so I forecasted this revenue segment based on the number of subscribers to YouTube Premium. Number of Subscribers in 2022 ([SOURCE]( Comparing Youtube Music to its strongest competitor Spotify, Spotify has a large switching cost due to years worth of playlists built that would be lost by switching over. On top of that, having to learn the new UI of YouTube Music and the lack of certain features that Spotify users are used to.So, the main driver for this segment would be YouTube Premium, given the indispensable nature of YouTube due to the strong network effect and new frontiers such as YouTube Shorts that are driving people to YouTube, and the longer unskippable ads, all these factors are driving people to subscribe to YouTube Premium. However, I‚Äôm cautious about how much or how fast YouTube Premium will grow. Due to strong competitors such as TikTok and Spotify, I‚Äôd assume the historic large growth will taper downwards as the high historic growth was due to the low-hanging fruits being picked.  &amp;#x200B;  When forecasting Revenue/Users, as GOOG wants to keep their prices low to attract users to YouTube Premium, historically the revenue/users have been declining. However, as recently as July 2023 GOOG started hiking prices. So, I‚Äôd assume that in my forecast from FY24 onwards, the Revenue/Users begin rising.  Historic price hikes have been at around 16%, I‚Äôd assume that GOOG no longer pursues such aggressive price rises and begins tapering down their price increases. Their perpetual Revenue/users growing in line with the perpetual inflation rate.  &amp;#x200B;  When forecasting Google Cloud revenue, since there isn‚Äôt available relevant data to create a bottoms-up revenue model I forecasted it as Y/Y growth. Taking into account ([SOURCE]( Given that GOOG mainly offers IAAS and SAAS for cloud computing, as businesses begin ramping up their digital efforts in line with the global push towards digitalization there is an increasing demand for IAAS and SAAS cloud computing, especially for IAAS which is stated to have the highest growth rate. I assumed that GOOG‚Äôs cloud revenue grew at a Y/Y CAGR of 19.3%.  # Cost:  When forecasting COGS, TAC accounted for about 40% of COGS as per 2023 10-K. I assumed that TAC would tend slightly upwards due to the competition for traffic increasing from competitors such as TikTok.  When forecasting R&amp;D and marketing, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.  When forecasting G&amp;A, management has stated that there is a potential usage of AI to reduce the need for labor. I‚Äôd assume that G&amp;A tends downward slightly.  # WACC:  RFR (1M Avg) = 4.14%  Beta ([SOURCE]( = 1.06  Stable market ERP ([SOURCE]( = 4.60%  COE = 9.02%  GOOG has a bond rating of AA ([SOURCE](  AA bond yield (1M Avg) = 4.80%  Marginal Tax rate = 21.00%  AT-COD = 3.79%  Stock price (5D Avg) = $147.05  Shares O/S = 12433M  Market Value of Equity = 1828272.65M  Weighted Average Debt = 10 Years  FY23 Interest Expense = 308M  Market Value of Debt = 12769.72M  %Debt = 0.007%  %Equity = 99.003%  WACC = 8.93%  #   Conclusion:  Ultimately, in my base case, I value GOOG at $143.16 per share. I believe that GOOG is a company with strong growth potential. However, given that GOOG is a household name and especially with the recent hype when they announced gemini it has led to a lot of enthusiasm and bullish outlook that caused their prices to temporarily spike upwards.

Waller struck a tougher tone in his comments to the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America, raising the possibility of a higher terminal rate if inflation numbers don‚Äôt cool. ***** &gt; He referred to January‚Äôs big payrolls report, which showed the economy added 517,000 jobs, as well as the latest reading from the consumer price index and personal consumption expenditures reports. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIf those data reports continue to come in too hot, the policy target range will have to be raised this year even more to ensure that we do not lose the momentum that was in place before the data for January were released,‚Äù Waller said. ***** &gt; The road ahead is a tough one for the central bank, regardless of the messaging they‚Äôre relaying to the public. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúNo matter how slow the Fed goes, no matter how much they ‚Äòcommunicate‚Äô what they want to do, there is no avoiding the potholes of reversing extraordinary easing,‚Äù Bleakley chief investment officer Peter Boockvar wrote in a note. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúWhen markets and the economy have been addicted and medicated for so long on low rates and QE, there will never be the right time to ease up,‚Äù he said. ***** &gt; On the economic data front, the Institute of Supply Management is due to release its Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers‚Äô Index (PMI) report on Friday morning.

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning July 17th, 2023,;,; Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 17th, 2023.  # **Dow closes 100 points higher Friday on solid earnings, registers best week since March: Live updates - [(Source)]( ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed Friday as strong earnings results from some of the biggest banks and companies kicked off earnings season. ***** &gt; The 30-stock Dow added 113.89 points, or 0.33%, to close at 34,509.03 and mark its fifth consecutive day of gains. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.10% to close at 4,505.42. The Nasdaq Composite declined 0.18%, ending at 14,113.70. Both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq touched their highest intraday levels since April 2022. ***** &gt; On a weekly basis, the Dow notched its best performance since March, up 2.3%. The S&amp;P 500 added 2.4%, and the Nasdaq gained 3.3%. ***** &gt; UnitedHealth shares lifted the blue-chip index Friday as its top performer. The insurance giant jumped more than 7% after it reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings and revenue. The company also raised the lower end of its full-year adjusted earnings guidance. UnitedHealth was also the biggest gainer in the S&amp;P 500‚Ä≤s health-care sector, which advanced 1.5%. ***** &gt; JPMorgan Chase rose 0.6% after its second-quarter earnings topped expectations. The bank was boosted by higher interest rates and rising interest income. Wells Fargo inched down 0.3%, even though the bank posted better-than-expected results. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve seen out of big bank earnings, especially JPMorgan, is pretty resilient,‚Äù said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing right now [that] default rates are still historically incredibly low and not showing signs of skyrocketing higher. So that‚Äôs a good sign for consumers and the economy,‚Äù Ladner added. ***** &gt; Expectations for this season are downbeat, with analysts forecasting a roughly 7% year-over-year drop in S&amp;P 500 earnings, according to FactSet. That would mark the worst earnings season since the second quarter of 2020, when S&amp;P 500 profits dropped 31.6%. ***** &gt; Investors‚Äô sentiment has been lifted by soft inflation reports this week. The latest producer price index report showed inflation rose less than anticipated and built on trader optimism from the June consumer price index data, which came out Wednesday. Investors are now considering whether a strong economy illustrated by the recent data could push stocks higher by the end of the year. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe Goldilocks scenario is alive and well, in terms of declining inflation pressures and [there‚Äôs] still fairly robust economic growth. So it‚Äôs a pretty good backdrop for risk assets,‚Äù said Ladner.  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](  *****  &gt; # NASDAQ Down 5 Straight During July Monthly Options Expiration Week  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Since 1982, the Friday of monthly options expiration week has a bearish bias for DJIA declining 23 times in 41 years with two unchanged years, 1991 and 1995. On Friday the average loss is 0.23% for DJIA and 0.25% for S&amp;P 500. NASDAQ‚Äôs record is even weaker, down 25 of 41 years with an average loss of 0.38%. DJIA posts the best full-week performance, up 24 of 41 with an average 0.37% gain. However, NASDAQ has been weakest, down 22 times and the last five straight. The week after monthly options expiration leans bearish for NASDAQ over the longer-term with an average loss. In recent years the track record had been improving until 2015‚Äôs across the board, greater than 2% loss.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # The Path to Lower Inflation is Now Clear  &gt; The June CPI report was a positive surprise, both in terms of the headline numbers as well as the underlying details.  &gt; Headline inflation rose 0.2% in June, which translates to a 2.2% annual pace. Over the past three months, inflation‚Äôs averaged about 2.7%, and over the last year it‚Äôs up 3.0%. That‚Äôs well off the peak pace of over 9% exactly a year ago.  &gt; In my opinion, the reason for the decline is obvious when you look at the chart below. Energy prices drove the inflation surge in 2022, especially after Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. Energy prices have now declined 17% over the past year, pulling inflation lower. The good news is that food inflation is also easing a lot, rising at an annual pace of just 1.3% over the past 3 months. Remember the surge in egg prices? Well, egg prices have fallen 21% over the past 3 months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; All this of course has been occurring for a few months now and shouldn‚Äôt be a big surprise.  &gt; The problem until now was that ‚Äúcore inflation,‚Äù i.e., inflation once you strip out energy and food prices, remained elevated. But we got good news on that front.  &gt; Core inflation rose just 0.16% in June, which translates to a 1.9% annual pace ‚Äî the slowest monthly pace since August 2021! That‚Äôs great, but as you can see below, the 3-month pace remains above 4%. So, we‚Äôve yet to see a consistent deceleration in core inflation, which is what the Federal Reserve is looking for.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; **Positive signs**  &gt; We realize that one month does not make a trend, but a lot of the underlying details point to downward momentum. Let‚Äôs look at a few of these.  &gt; Used and new vehicle prices, which make up 9% of the core inflation ‚Äúbasket,‚Äù have reversed a lot over the past year. However, used car prices rose in April and May, reversing some of that momentum. But things look to have turned around once again, with used car prices falling 0.5% in June. In fact, prices are likely to fall further over the next few months based on private used car auction data (Ryan pointed this out in his previous blog as well).  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Moreover, the auto production supply chain bottlenecks are being resolved, and therefore we‚Äôre seeing vehicle production increase. As a result, prices for new vehicles have fallen about 0.4% over the past three months, and that downtrend is likely to continue given increased supply.  &gt; The big one is housing inflation, which Ryan and I have been talking a lot about over the past year. Housing makes up 40% of core inflation, but importantly, it does not include home prices. Instead, it‚Äôs based on rents. The problem is that there is a significant lag between official rental inflation and private rents data. Private data from Apartment List shows that rents have decelerated from a peak of 18% year-over-year pace to zero as of June! Official data lags this data by about 12 months or so and it‚Äôs taken a while to reflect market reality.  &gt; The good news is that official rental inflation appears to be turning lower. Rental inflation was averaging a 9% annual pace between June 2022 and February 2023. However, that‚Äôs fallen to about 6% over the past 4 months. That‚Äôs still higher than the 2018-2019 average of about 3-3.5%. But given what we‚Äôre seeing in market rents, we expect housing inflation to continue decelerating and that‚Äôs going to pull core inflation down in a big way later this year and into 2024 as well.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; **What about the rest?**  &gt; Fed Chair Powell has cited ‚Äúcore services ex housing‚Äù as still being elevated. We believe it‚Äôs their way of saying,  &gt; ‚ÄúYes, we see vehicle prices heading lower, and acknowledge the lags in housing inflation data; but we want to see the rest of it fall‚Äù  &gt; But there‚Äôs good news on that front too.  &gt; The Atlanta Federal Reserve calculates something called the ‚ÄúSticky Price CPI excluding food, energy, and shelter.‚Äù Simply put, it measures inflation for items whose prices typically don‚Äôt change frequently.  &gt; In June, this sticky price measure was flat. Over the past 3 months it‚Äôs running at a 1.4% annual pace, well below the peak of 7.3% we saw 15 months ago. A key piece of this is restaurant food prices, which have slowed down a lot recently on the back of falling food prices. But even things like airfares, daycare and pet care services inflation have been falling.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; You can see why the June inflation report was positive from so many angles. A low reading is positive by itself, but it also confirmed what we know from other sources about what to expect going forward.  &gt; Perhaps the best news is that inflation is falling, and poised to fall even further, without a rise in unemployment and an economic slowdown. A year ago, Federal Reserve officials and many economists were saying that we probably need to go into a recession for inflation to slow down, and that aggressive rate hikes by the Fed would push us into one.  &gt; Instead, the unemployment rate is at 3.6%, close to 50-year lows. If real GDP growth clocks in around 2% for last quarter (as seems likely), that would mean the economy‚Äôs grown at a 2.5% pace over the past year. While inflation‚Äôs fallen from 9% to 3%. That‚Äôs huge!  *****  &gt; # NASDAQ‚Äôs Midyear Rally Ends on Friday  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; From its close on June 27 (the fourth from last trading day) through today, NASDAQ has gained 2.7% which makes this year‚Äôs NASDAQ midyear rally slightly better than average. Today‚Äôs gains were largely fueled by better than anticipated CPI reading. Provided this translates into a better-than-expected PPI report tomorrow, additional gains are likely before NASDAQ‚Äôs midyear rally officially ends on Friday, July 14. The end of the rally also coincides with the historical seasonal mid-month July market peak in pre-election years. Since 1950, the second half of July has been weaker than the first half.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Inflation Expectations Still on the Decline  &gt; Ahead of Wednesday's CPI, the New York Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations (SCES) was released earlier this week and showed a continuation of the trend where consumer inflation expectations have been falling. Over the next 12 months, the Fed's survey showed that the median expected rate of inflation fell from 4.07% down to 3.83%. While still above its historical average of 3.4%, consumer expectations for inflation over the next year are down to the lowest level since April 2021. Over a longer time horizon, inflation expectations haven't fallen nearly as fast, but they didn't rise anywhere near as much as short-term expectations either. In the June survey, the median expected rate of inflation over the next three years fell from 2.98% down to 2.95%. While that reading barely budged, we would note that current expectations for inflation over the next three years are slightly below the long-term average. Unlike the FOMC, which ditched the term transitory 18 months ago, consumers have remained on team transitory.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; One issue which has the potential to push inflation higher is how consumers expect their incomes to change over time. In this month's survey, the median expected rate of earnings growth increased from 2.80% up to 2.98% which is right around the high end of its range from the last two years. As shown in the chart below, while this series has tested the 3% level multiple times, it hasn't been able to bust through it. As it pertains to inflation, that's a good thing, because if consumers expect their incomes to increase, they're probably also less likely to push back on higher prices. At the same time, the fact that this reading has settled into a new higher range relative to its long-term average suggests that getting back down to and staying at levels of inflation that prevailed before COVID may prove to be difficult.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Small-caps Catch a Bid  &gt; Small-caps have caught a bid over the last few days with the Russell 2,000 ETF (IWM) rallying more than 3% since last Thursday's close. Over the same time frame, the large-cap S&amp;P 500 is up just 0.3%.  &gt; While large-cap indices have recently traded to 52-week highs, small-caps are still well below 2023 highs made back in Q1. As shown below, though, IWM is currently attempting to break above the top end of the sideways range it has been in over the last month. If it can do that, the highs from earlier in the year will come into sight.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The Russell 2,000 (IWM) chart looks pretty interesting over a multi-year time frame. As shown below, the pre-COVID high made in early 2020 has acted as strong support over the past year. While IWM fell sharply during the mini-banking crisis this March, it stopped going down once it reached this key support level, and then it traded sideways and consolidated throughout much of April and May. Going forward, it appears that the Russell has built a strong base over the past year to springboard off of if the bull market for US equities can continue.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; A chart that always captures our attention is the one below that shows Apple's (AAPL) market cap versus the combined market cap of all of the stocks in the small-cap Russell 2,000. Prior to COVID, Apple's market cap wasn't even close to the $2+ trillion market cap of the Russell 2,000. Since late 2021, though, the two have been battling it out. After its huge gain in Q2, Apple is currently in the lead at $2.96 trillion, but the Russell isn't too far behind at $2.81 trillion.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Here We Go Again  &gt; ‚ÄúHere I go again on my own. Going down the only road I‚Äôve ever known.‚Äù  &gt; -Here I Go Again by Whitesnake  &gt; One of the main reasons we came into 2023 overweight equities (when everyone else was talking recessions and bear markets) was the over-the-top negativity. Rarely is the crowd and obvious trade right when it comes to investing and we assumed should we get any good news, stocks could surprise to the upside. One of the most staggering signs of negativity was the median strategist in this Bloomberg survey was looking for negative stock returns in ‚Äô23.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; As we noted in Is Anyone Bullish? (from December 11, 2022), we‚Äôd never seen strategists this bearish heading into a new year. Then layer on the fact that stocks were down close to 20% in 2022 and the odds greatly favored a big bounce back year, as stocks were rarely down two years a in a row. Not to mention, the macro backdrop was on much better footing than the M2 is crashing, LEI is down, and yield curve fearmongers were telling us.  &gt; All that happened was that the first six months of this year was the second best start to a year since 2000 for the S&amp;P 500, best start for the NASDAQ in 40 years and the best start ever for the NASDAQ-100.  &gt; Where are we now? Well, similar to the great Whitesnake song in the quote above, here I go again, down the only road I‚Äôve ever known.  &gt; Apparently, the only road these strategists know is doubling down on lower prices, as they expect the most bearish second half EVER. We‚Äôll gladly take the other side to this, as we expect stocks to gain nicely the rest of this year, likely to new all-time highs.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Take note the other years they expected lower prices during the final six months of the year were 1999, 2019, 2020, and 2021. All the S&amp;P 500 did those years was gain 7.0%, 9.8%, 21.2%, and 10.9%, respectively, over the final six months. That comes out to a very impressive 12.2% average, not bad, not bad.  &gt; What also has my attention? We have some big inflation data out this week, but we‚Äôve already seen some nice signs that inflation could surprise to the downside. First up, used cars accounted for nearly a third of the jump in inflation the past few years, but it is crashing lower, with used car prices experiencing their largest monthly drop since COVID. Given light auto production is running close to pre-COVID levels, this is another sign supply chains are working again and price pressures are abating.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Speaking of supply chains, the New York Fed Global Supply Chain Pressure Index did jump last month, but it was coming off of the lowest level in history. Bottom line, supply chains are back to normal after years of disruptions.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Along with supply chains and used car prices improving, we expect to see shelter take a big dive the second half of this year. Remember, shelter makes up more than 40% of CPI and it has stayed stubbornly high lately. Well, we‚Äôve seen drastic improvements from private data places like Apartment List and Zillow, suggesting that the government‚Äôs data will likely follow suit soon.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Lastly, we‚Äôve been hearing a lot that the trillions of dollars in excess savings that consumers had over COVID was nearly all the way gone. The media are spinning this as a bearish event, as it means consumers aren‚Äôt saving anymore and they will run out of money to spend and keep the economy growing. Here‚Äôs the issue with that, the savings rate has been trending higher the past year and is more than two percent higher than it was in early 2022. The employment backdrop is still healthy, spending is solid and consumer confidence is improving. To us, all of that is positive.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  Here is the list of notable tickers reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)  *****  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]( &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())** (N/A.)  *****  # DISCUSS!

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning August 7th, 2023,;,; Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning August 7th, 2023.  # **S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq tumble for four straight days, notch worst weeks since March: Live updates - [(Source)]( ***** &gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slumped Friday for a fourth straight session, and notched their worst weeks since March, as traders seemed to book profits following the latest corporate earnings releases and U.S. jobs data. ***** &gt; The S&amp;P 500 shed 0.53% to finish at 4,478.03, while the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.36% to settle at 13,909.24. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 150.27 points, or 0.43%, to end at 35,065.62. ***** &gt; All the major indexes reversed earlier gains during afternoon trading, and finished the week with losses. The Nasdaq and S&amp;P dropped about 2.9% and 2.3%, respectively, to notch their worst weeks since March. The Dow edged down 1.1%. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúPeople this week seem more respectful of risk than they were before,‚Äù said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, adding that ‚Äúlots of bears have been capitulating, which is often a sign that we‚Äôre closer to the end of a rally than the beginning.‚Äù ***** &gt; After being lower on the day, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) rose to trade above 16 ‚Äî pointing to investors adding volatility protection. ***** &gt; Friday marked the final day of what‚Äôs been the busiest week of second-quarter earnings season. Amazon jumped 8.3% to its highest level in nearly a year after trouncing expectations on profit and offering positive guidance. Apple lost 4.8% after reporting lower revenue than the year-ago quarter. Both tech giants reported results late Thursday. ***** &gt; In a sign of the boom in travel and services demand, Booking Holdings gained 7.9% on stronger-than-expected results. Amgen popped 5.5% on solid earnings and a boosted guidance. ***** &gt; Earnings reports this season for the quarter ended in June have continued to surprise some Wall Street analysts as the expected slowdown in profits proves less than feared. About 84% of S&amp;P 500 companies have given results, with 80% surpassing Wall Street expectations, according to FactSet. ***** &gt; The 10-year Treasury yield also pulled back from a multimonth high to 4.04%. Its rise in recent sessions had pressured risk assets. ***** &gt; # A cooler jobs report  &gt; Investors also received more clues into the state of the labor market with Friday‚Äôs payrolls report. The data showed 187,000 jobs added in July, less than the 200,000 expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. The unemployment rate also ticked lower to 3.5% from 3.6%. ***** &gt; Despite the cooler headline numbers, average hourly wages pointed toward more inflation and came in ahead of expectations, rising 0.4% for the month, and 4.4% on an annualized basis. That came in slightly ahead of the 0.3% and 4.2% expected, respectively. ***** &gt; Many on Wall Street had been eagerly awaiting the jobs report and its implications for the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate-hiking cycle. About 88% of traders expect the central bank to hold rates steady at its next meeting in September, according to CME Group‚Äôs FedWatch tool. ***** &gt; But next week‚Äôs consumer price report for July could make an even greater impact on rate expectations, said Wells Fargo‚Äôs Christopher Harvey. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúA hotter-than-expected print is one of the few things that could really start to change the market‚Äôs perception of the Fed, and maybe the Fed‚Äôs perception as well,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut today‚Äôs job number, I don‚Äôt think does much of anything. I think it solidifies people‚Äôs view that the Fed is done at this point.‚Äù  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](  *****  &gt; # The Economy is Normalizing, and That‚Äôs a Good Thing  &gt; The economy created 187,000 jobs in July, slightly softer than the 200,000 that economists expected. The last couple of months were revised lower, and so it‚Äôs always helpful to take a 3-month average, which is now running at 218,000. That‚Äôs stronger than the pre-pandemic average of 183,000.  &gt; In short, job growth remains strong. You will hear some people heralding this as the onset of a recession, but more likely this is just normalization of the economy rather than weakness. The report aligns with what we wrote in our Mid-Year 2023 Outlook, not to mention the title: ‚ÄúEdging Closer to Normal‚Äù.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The private sector created 172,000 jobs in July, up from 128,000 in June. On a sector level, job growth this year has been driven by non-cyclical areas like health care, education, and government. These sectors had lagged in the early recovery, accounting for just 13% of jobs created in 2021, and 25% in 2022. Over the first 7 months of this year, they‚Äôve accounted for more than 50% of jobs created. July didn‚Äôt buck that trend, with health care seeing 100,000 jobs created. Government jobs were on the softer side, rising 15,000 in July versus an average of 53,000 between April and June.  &gt; The cyclical areas of the economy, especially construction, manufacturing, and leisure and hospitality, remain on the softer side, with job growth adding up to 34,000 across these three sectors. So far this year, these sectors have accounted for about 20% of job creation (not exactly ‚Äúweak‚Äù), versus 36% in 2022 and 43% in 2021.  &gt; Again, the theme is normalization.  &gt; **The Best Labor Market Since the Late 1990s**  &gt; The unemployment rate fell to 3.5%, not far from 50+ year lows of 3.4%. What is amazing is that the unemployment rate is slightly below where it was in June 2023, when the Fed really started to get aggressive with rate hikes.  &gt; The unemployment rate can be impacted by people leaving the labor force (technically defined as those ‚Äúnot looking for work‚Äù) and an aging population. I‚Äôve discussed in prior blogs how we can get around this by looking at the employment-population ratio for prime age workers, i.e. workers aged 25-54 years. This measures the number of people working as a percent of the civilian population. Think of it as the opposite of the unemployment rate, and because we use prime age, you also get around the demographic issue.  &gt; The good news is that the prime-age employment-population ratio remained at 80.9%. That is higher than at any point since May 2001. It was actually falling at that time, and didn‚Äôt recover until now. This is the best indication that the labor market remains very healthy, and probably in the best shape since the late 1990s.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; **Bottom Line: All Signs Point to a Strong Economy**  &gt; The US economy runs on consumption, and for that you need income. The good news is that income growth appears to remain strong and looks to be running ahead of inflation. In fact, wage growth rose 0.4% in July. Monthly numbers can be volatile, but the 3-month annualized pace is 4.9%.  &gt; You combine strong wage growth with strong employment, and that translates to strong income gains across the entire economy. Over the last 3 months, overall income growth for all workers is running at a 5.3% annual pace. Meanwhile, headline inflation is running close to 2.0%. The difference between the two tells you how fast incomes are growing after adjusting for inflation, and that‚Äôs running above a 3% annual pace over the past 3 months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](   &gt; In my opinion, that‚Äôs your simplest measure of underlying economic growth and should tell you things are ok. Normalization is not the same as weakness.  *****  &gt; # Sentiment Swings Higher Despite Declines  &gt; Equities have rolled over in the past week with selling hitting a pinnacle when the US government's credit rating was downgraded by Fitch on Wednesday. In spite of this, sentiment has not taken a hit. The latest survey from the AAII showed 49% of respondents reported bullish sentiment which compares to 44.9% the prior week. With nearly half of respondents reporting as optimists, bullish sentiment sits handily above its historical average of 37.5%. In fact, this week marked the ninth in a row with a bullish sentiment reading above the historical average for the longest such streak since one that ended at 13 weeks long in May 2021.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The increase in bullish sentiment resulted in bearish sentiment to drop down to 21.3% which marks a 2.8 percentage point decline on the week and resulted in the lowest bearish reading since June 10, 2021 when it was 20.7%. Similar to bullish sentiment, that is the ninth week in a row with a reading below its historical average, and that is the longest streak since July 2021.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; As a result to the increased optimism, the bull-bear spread ticked up from 20.8 last week to 27.7. That is still below the recent high of 29.9 from two weeks ago, but reiterates how investors have an elevated degree of optimism.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Not all of the gains to bulls came from bears. Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling from 31% to 29.7%. That is in the middle of the past few years' range.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Small Dent to Claims  &gt; Initial jobless claims have been trending lower over the past couple of months, reaching a nearly six month low of 221K last week. This week, claims rebounded rising 6K to 227K. Albeit off the strongest readings from last fall, that remains a healthy reading on joblessness.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, claims are at historically solid levels even if they have come off their best levels. This week, claims dropped to 205K. That is slightly above the readings from the comparable weeks of the year of the past few years (excluding 2020 and 2021 when claims were much more elevated).  &gt; At this point of the year, claims falling is normal as shown in the second chart below. The current week of the year has only seen claims rise week over week 10.7% of the time. That is the sixth most consistent week of declines of the year. Claims will continue to face seasonal tailwinds in the weeks ahead, but that will begin to reverse as summer turns to fall.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Continuing claims also ticked higher in the latest week's data, reaching 1.7 million. Although higher than 1.69 million the previous week, continuing claims have much more consistently been trending lower recently, and this week's reading did in fact come in below forecasts of 1.705 million.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Downgrades Overlooked  &gt; The bottom has dropped out for the major US indices today with the Nasdaq down over 2% and S&amp;P 500 down 1.25% as of this writing. The catalyst has been the downgrade of the United States' credit rating by Fitch from AAA to AA+ . That is the first downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt in almost twelve years and just the second ever. In the charts below, we show the performance of the S&amp;P 500, government debt, commodities, and the US dollar in the year before and the year after the 2011 downgrade.  &gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been rallying in the months leading up to this downgrade, however, back in 2011 the S&amp;P 500 had already begun rolling over by the time S&amp;P downgraded US debt. In the wake of that downgrade, the S&amp;P 500 went on to fully erase all of the prior year's gains. Fortunately, all of those losses were quickly recouped within three months of the downgrade.  &gt; As for Treasuries and other US agency debt, performance over the past few months has been the complete opposite of 2011. Of course, the interest rate environment is also completely different now with Fed Funds 500 bps higher than it was at the time of the last downgrade. That being said, in 2011, Treasury yields were on the decline in the months headed into the downgrade, but contrary to what might have been expected, the downgrade itself did not change that trend. This time around has seen yields on US government debt moving in the opposite direction.  &gt; Bloomberg's broad commodity index has been in a similar boat with the past few months seeing a decline compared to the steady uptrend back in 2011 that was uninterrupted by the downgrade.  &gt; Finally, we would note the downgrade only acted as a longer-term turning point for the dollar. As shown in the bottom right hand chart, both this year and in 2011, the trade weighted dollar was in a downtrend in the year before the downgrade. But right as S&amp;P changed its rating, the dollar turned higher and continued to rise throughout the following year. In fact, one year out it had erased the entirety of the previous year's decline.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Stocks Don‚Äôt Like August, Now What?  &gt; ‚ÄúPlans are worthless, but planning is everything.‚Äù President Dwight D. Eisenhower  &gt; Another month and more strong gains. Make that five months in a row, the S&amp;P 500 finished higher. The S&amp;P 500 is now up close to 20% on the year, just like everyone predicted.  &gt; We came into the year overweight stocks and remain there, so this run has been a lot of fun for us. But honestly, while we‚Äôve been bullish, even we‚Äôve been surprised by how strong markets have been.  &gt; So let‚Äôs get the bad news out of the way. The odds are increasing that stocks could finally take some type of a break. Seasonality has worked out perfectly this year. Here‚Äôs a chart we shared many, many times, and it said that some of the very best quarters out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle were the three now just behind us. Sure enough, the fourth quarter last year and the first two quarters this year were spectacular for stocks, just like history suggested. Now seasonality is saying to be open to some type of weakness, or at least a break.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; To be clear, we do not expect major weakness. But we believe a modest pullback of approximately 5% would be perfectly normal. The S&amp;P 500 has closed higher for five consecutive months. And we‚Äôre now moving into the austere month of August. August has been a poor performer, ranking worse than only February and September since 1950 and trailing behind only September and December in the last ten years, although still averaging a positive return over both periods. Oh, and right behind August comes September, the weakest month seasonally. So, while the calendar was a tailwind, we believe it is now becoming a near-term headwind.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Taking another look at August, when stocks are up more than 17.5% for the year heading into this month, a breather is even more likely. We found 11 previous years (since 1950), this occurred, and August was higher only three times and down 1.1% on average. So the better the year, the worse August does, apparently.  &gt; One of the reasons we were on record for a surprise summer rally was how stocks tended to do when they had a big first month of the year. When the S&amp;P 500 gained more than 5% in January a summer rally tended to occur (check). But we take seasonal warnings as seriously as seasonal support, and now we are in a period of potential seasonal weakness, at least for the near term.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; If stocks experience weakness over the coming months, investors may be surprised and even start projecting the catastrophe many had expected earlier in the year. But keep in mind a pullback in the next couple of months would be entirely normal seasonal behavior. In fact, it may present buying opportunities, or it may simply be a chance to stay the course and remind ourselves that most years see more than three separate 5% pullbacks. Even in a strong year, there will often be bouts of volatility, so we should be ready for it and avoid overreacting. As President Eisenhower said, start planning today.  &gt; Lastly, the S&amp;P 500 closed up five consecutive months yesterday. Historically, stocks have done quite well after similar streaks. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has been up a year later, 26 out of the past 28 times. However, the last time this happened was in June 2021, and that was followed by a drop of nearly 12%. Despite this recent example, the market‚Äôs historical strength is likely another indication of higher stock prices in the future.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; All in all, the odds are increasing that stocks could see some seasonal weakness, but we don‚Äôt think it will be anything major. In fact, maybe a little breather could be just what the bulls need for an eventual strong end-of-year rally.  *****  &gt; # $10 Trillion Added in Market Cap; 2023's Best and Worst Through July  &gt; The US stock market (using the Russell 3,000 as a proxy) has now seen an increase in market cap of roughly $10 trillion from its bear market low last October through the end of July 2023. As shown below, the peak market cap for the US stock market was $51.5 trillion seen on the first day of 2022. From high to low, total US market cap fell $13.7 trillion during last year's bear, but since then it has risen back up to $47.7 trillion. To get back to new all-time highs, we currently need market cap to rise by roughly $3.8 trillion.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The average Russell 3,000 stock rose 5.74% in July. There were 813 stocks in the index that rose 10%+ in July, including 29 names that rose 50%+. Below is a table of these 50%+ gainers. Four names rose 100%: PolyMet Mining (PLM), Quantum-Si (QSI), UroGen Pharma (URGN), and Bridgebio Pharma (BBIO). Other notable names on the list of big July winners include Nikola (NKLA), Upstart (UPST), Carvana (CVNA), QuantumScape (QS), Rivian (RIVN), and Riot (RIOT). This list is made up of many of the high-fliers during the post-COVID bull that then got slaughtered during last year's bear.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Through July, the average Russell 3,000 stock was up 18.1% year-to-date. Below is a list of the 35 names that are already up 200%+ on the year. Topping the list is Carvana (CVNA) with a YTD gain of 869% after gaining 77.3% in July. Back in December 2022, CVNA had fallen into the $4s, but it's now back up to the mid-$40s. Next up is Bit Digital (BTBT) with a YTD gain of 638%, followed by Cipher Mining (CIFR), IonQ (IONQ), Riot (RIOT), and Applied Digital (APLD). Similar to the list of July's biggest winners, the biggest winners YTD are many of the names that got hit the hardest last year, with many falling more than 70% during their bear market drawdowns. Carvana, for example, was actually down 98% from its all-time high when it bottomed in 2022, so even after gaining more than 800% this year, it needs to gain another 700% from here to get back to new highs.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Key ETF Performance Through July 2023  &gt; The S&amp;P 500-tracking ETF (SPY) finished July up 3.27%, leaving it up 20.62% YTD on a total return basis. The mega-cap Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) gained only slightly more than SPY in July, but it's up more than twice as much as SPY on a YTD basis at +44.5%. The small-cap Russell 2,000 (IWM) did better than large-caps and mid-caps in July with a gain of 6.11%, but IWM is up less than large-caps on a YTD basis at +14.7%. Value and dividend stocks held up well in July and actually outperformed growth for the month, but value is lagging YTD and the DJ Dividend ETF (DVY) is actually down 0.5% on the year.  &gt; Looking at US sectors, Energy (XLE) and Financials (XLF) -- which lagged in the first half of 2023 -- did the best in July, while Health Care (XLV) and Real Estate (XLRE) were up the least. Technology (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC) are currently neck and neck on a YTD basis with XLK up 43.94% through July and XLC up just three basis points more at 43.97%.  &gt; Outside of the US, we saw China (ASHR) and Israel (EIS) gain the most in July, while France (EWQ) and Spain (EWP) gained the least. YTD, it's Mexico (EWW) that's currently atop the list of country ETFs with a gain of 42.85%.  &gt; Oil (USO) gained 15%+ in July, while natural gas (UNG) fell 4.2%. Gold (GLD) saw a small monthly gain of 2.3% versus a gain of 8.6% for silver (SLV). Finally, with yields rising again during the month, Treasury ETFs were in the red. Aside from natural gas, the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) is down more than any other asset class in our matrix on a YoY basis with a total return of -12.3%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Dogs of the Dow for the Dog Days of Summer  &gt; With the Dow coming off of a historic winning streak last week, below we check in on performance of the index versus the Dogs of the Dow. The Dogs of a Dow is a stock-picking strategy that invests in the index members with the highest dividend yields at the end of a year holds them through the end of the next year. On a total return basis, the Dow's recent winning streak has been a benefit to both the overall index and the Dogs alike. That said, the gains to the former have brought the index up near 2022 highs on a total return basis while the Dogs of the Dow has much further to go given the overall weakness of dividend-oriented equities recently.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; In the table below, we show the returns of this year's Dogs of the Dow and all other individual Dow members. The Dogs of the Dow are host to some of the stocks with the worst performance this year like Verizon (VZ) and Chevron (CVX), however, there are also a couple of big winners like Intel (INTC) which has returned nearly 42% YTD or JPMorgan Chase (JPM) which has nearly posted a 20% return. However, the biggest gains in the index have come from non-Dogs. In fact, the largest gains this year have been from those with the lowest or no dividend yields at the end of last year like Boeing (BA), Salesforce (CRM), or Apple (AAPL).  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  Here is the list of notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; (**T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.**)  *****  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]( &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]())** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  # DISCUSS!

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning April 17th, 2023,;,; Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning April 17th, 2023.  # **Dow sheds more than 100 points Friday, but notches fourth straight positive week: Live updates - [(Source)]( ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Friday, but was headed for a positive week, as investors assessed a weak retail sales report that dented enthusiasm around a stronger-than-expected start to corporate earnings. ***** &gt; The 30-stock Dow dropped 143.22 points, or about 0.42%, to 33,886.47. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.21% to 4,137.64. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite slid 0.35% to 12,123.47. ***** &gt; The Dow, however, notched its fourth-straight positive week, rising 1.2%. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq, meanwhile, nabbed their fourth positive week in five. The broad-market index added 0.79% for the week, while the Nasdaq ticked higher by 0.29%. ***** &gt; Advance retail sales in March showed consumer spending fell twice as much as expected. Retail sales declined by 1% last month, more than the 0.5% drop expected by economists polled by Dow Jones, in part because consumers paid less for fuel. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúRetail sales came in weaker than expected, but a lot of the miss had to do with lower gas prices, which all things being equal is a slight positive for spending,‚Äù wrote Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúInflation has been coming down as gas prices have been coming down, but that can reverse in an instant, which would drive the headline numbers higher. What is more concerning is that core (which excludes food and gas prices) has been stubbornly high ‚Äì and where we believe the risks to higher-rates-for-longer lie,‚Äù Zaccarelli added. ***** &gt; The disappointing retail sales data offset excitement around strong corporate earnings. JPMorgan Chase reported record revenue that beat analysts‚Äô expectations, with the stock rising more than 7%. Wells Fargo shares briefly rose as much as 2.1% after the bank reported growing profits, before closing about flat. These were the first bank earnings since the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank last month. ***** &gt; Elsewhere, UnitedHealth, which has the biggest weighting in the Dow, fell 2.7% after what Mizuho described as a ‚Äúmodest beat and raise.‚Äù The action came after UnitedHealth said it‚Äôs spending more for new diabetes and weight loss drugs from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. ***** &gt; Meanwhile, Boeing closed lower by more than 5%. On Thursday, the aircraft maker warned of delivery delays for some of its 737 Max planes. ***** &gt; Expectations for this earnings season are downbeat. Analysts polled by Refinitiv expect S&amp;P 500 earnings fell more than 5% in the first quarter. That forecast comes as companies deal with persistent inflation and higher rates. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúThe bar has never been set lower,‚Äù said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial. ‚ÄúMy guess is with consensus expectations for the S&amp;P 500 to show earnings that are down some 5%, that may well be overstating what we actually find out.‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think that what‚Äôs going to be super important is the kind of guidance we get, and how confident that corporations will be in guiding for the next three quarters in the face of what likely will be a slower economy.‚Äù ***** &gt; Investors also assessed two back-to-back reports this week signaling cooling inflation. The March producer price index, a measure of prices paid by companies, declined 0.5% from the prior month, even as economists polled by Dow Jones expected prices to stay the same. Excluding food and energy, the index shed 0.1% from the prior month, while economists estimated a 0.2% month-to-month increase. ***** &gt; The PPI, which is considered a leading indicator of consumer inflation, bolstered a trend of easing inflation seen in the March consumer price index report released Wednesday. Consumer prices grew 5% on an annual basis, which was the smallest year-over-year increase in nearly two years.  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](   *****  &gt; # Three More Bullish Signals The Bears Don‚Äôt Want To See  &gt; ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt know where you want to get to‚Ä¶.it doesn‚Äôt matter which way you go.‚Äù -The Cheshire Cat to Alice in Alice in Wonderland.  &gt; Stocks have continued to stage an impressive rally off the mid-March lows, so much so that we have now seen multiple rare and potentially bullish signals trigger. Today, I‚Äôll take a look at three of these signals. Yes, by itself any one of these signals could be noise, but when you start stacking them on top of each other, like the Cheshire Cat said in the quote above, stocks likely want to go higher and we should be ready to know where they could head.  &gt; First up, the S&amp;P 500 had it‚Äôs best first quarter since 2019, up 7.0%, which came on the heels of 7.1% gain the quarter before. What happened after previous big first quarters? I found there were 16 other first quarters that gained at least 5% and the final three quarters of the year finished higher 15 times. Yes, the one year that didn‚Äôt work was 1987 and when people hear that year, they start to get worried. Well, stocks were up 40% for the year in August back then, so we‚Äôll worry about having another 1987 if we see returns like that (which we don‚Äôt expect). Until then, this is another clue the bulls could have a nice 2023.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Next, we‚Äôve heard a lot how only a few stocks are leading the overall markets higher. We don‚Äôt fully agree there and one way to show this is there was a recent sign of extreme buying pressure across many sectors and stocks. Using data from our friends at Ned Davis Research, more than 93% of the stocks in the NDR universe were recently above their 10-day moving average. All you need to know here is this is a rare sign of broad-based strength and a year later stocks were higher 23 out of 24 times with some very solid returns along the way.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Lastly, Marty Zweig is known as one of the best traders ever and he coined the Zweig Breadth Thrust (ZBT) indicator many years ago. Well, we just saw a rare trigger of this potentially bullish signal. To keep it simple, this signal looks at all the stocks on the NYSE and it looks for periods of extreme oversold periods moving to periods of extremely overbought in a short timeframe. Think of it as a washout and then heavy buying coming in, which tends to open the door to higher prices.  &gt; The table below shows the previous 14 ZBTs and what happened next. Wouldn‚Äôt you know it, but the S&amp;P 500 was higher a year later every single time. That is 14 out of 14 and up 23.3% on average. Sure, the sample size isn‚Äôt probably as large as we‚Äôd like to consider this statistically relevant, but I‚Äôd sure rather know this than ignore it.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Finally, here‚Äôs a chart showing the ZBTs. Sometimes a picture tells the story and one look at this, and it would be quite rare for this signal to trigger and for stocks to simply drop right back to new lows. In fact, usually it happens ahead of periods of strength.  *****  &gt; # First Republic and Other Banks See Large Jumps in Short Interest  &gt; Short interest figures get published every two weeks, and movements in short interest are a helpful way to gauge bull/bear positioning on individual names as well as groups and sectors. When a stock has a high percentage of shares sold short, it means that a lot of investors are betting against it. If a highly-shorted company manages to produce better than expected results, however, shares will often see outsized gains as many of those shorts rush to cover.  &gt; With bank failures and deposit flight emerging in March, causing two S&amp;P 500 bank stocks to fail and many other regional bank stocks to fall precipitously, we were interested to see how short interest levels changed during the month. End-of-month short interest figures for March were just recently published, and below is a table showing stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 that saw the biggest increases in short interest as a percentage of float (SIPF) during the month.  &gt; As shown, the two stocks that saw the biggest increases in short interest were First Republic Bank (FRC) and PacWest Bancorp (PACW). At the end of February, FRC only had 2.71% of its float sold short, but by the end of March, that figure had spiked to 29.51%. PacWest's jump in short interest was slightly less extreme, but it was extreme nonetheless, rising from 3.59% up to 20.56% in March. Another nine Financials are on the list of the 30 S&amp;P 1500 stocks that saw the biggest jumps in SIPF in March, while another five REITs made the list as well.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Below is a better look at just how much short interest spiked for First Republic (FRC) in March. While the bank did see a mini-spike in late 2018 when the broader market was struggling with another batch of Fed tightening, FRC's short interest normally sits between 0-5% of float. Now it's up to nearly 30%. For a stock that's down 94% from its highs, where do you think the risk/reward lies at this point?  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; In terms of the most heavily shorted stocks, only Big Lots (BIG) currently has a higher percentage of its float sold short than FRC in the S&amp;P 1500.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Below is a chart showing the average change in SIPF for stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 by industry group in the month of March. As shown, the Banks saw the biggest average jump at 0.78 ppts, followed by Telecom Services, Media &amp; Entertainment, and REITs. Stocks in the Consumer Durables &amp; Apparel group saw the largest decline in SIPF at -0.23 ppts.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Sentiment: Back to the 20s  &gt; Whereas last week saw a huge rebound in bullish sentiment after the S&amp;P 500's breakout above March highs, the more listless price action of the past week resulted in a modest turnaround in sentiment. The latest AAII sentiment survey showed only 26.1% of respondents reported as bullish compared to the recent high of 33.3% last week. The 7.2 percentage point decline was the largest one-week drop in bulls since the last week of February when it declined by 12.5 percentage points. That leaves bullish sentiment right in the middle of the range since the start of 2022.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Although bullish sentiment fell, without any considerable push lower for the S&amp;P 500, bearish sentiment went little changed falling just half of one percentage point down to 34.5%. Like last week, that remains the lowest reading since the week of February 16th.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; That means that all of the declines in bullish and bearish sentiment flowed to the neutral camp with a surge of 7.9 percentage points; the largest one-week increase since the first week of the year. At 39.5%, neutral sentiment is at the high end of the past few years' range and only 0.3 percentage points below the late February high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The AAII survey was not the only sentiment reading to take a more bearish tone this week. The NAAIM Exposure index's latest release today showed investment managers reduced equity exposure. Meanwhile, the Investors Intelligence survey's bull-bear spread has actually continued to rise resulting in the highest reading since the first week of 2022. Additionally, as we noted in Monday's Chart of the Day, the TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index went unchanged in March after rebounding in the proceeding few months. In other words, across multiple readings, sentiment has improved but has yet to definitively shift to bullish.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # The Good, The Bad, The Inflation  &gt; The March inflation report showed that CPI inflation rose only 0.1%, slightly below expectations. Over the past year, inflation is now up 5%, well off the peak 9% from June 2022. As you can see below, the big driver of lower inflation has been energy and food.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Energy makes up about 7% of the ‚Äúinflation basket‚Äù, split almost equally into commodities (like gasoline) and services (like electricity and piped gas). Thanks to the pullback in oil prices, energy commodity prices are now below where they were in December 2021. The recent drop in natural gas prices has also sent services prices lower over the past couple of months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Further good news: prices for ‚Äúfood at home‚Äù, i.e. groceries, fell 0.3% in March. This is the first price decline since September 2020, and bodes well even for prices and restaurants and such (which are still elevated).  &gt; # Lower energy and food prices are a big deal, for consumption &gt; Lower inflation, by way of lower energy and food prices, means ‚Äúreal‚Äù incomes, i.e. incomes adjusted for inflation, remain strong. More so if the labor market remains healthy, which looks to be the case as we wrote the other day.  &gt; The chart below shows annualized growth rates of disposable income, employee compensation (across all workers in the economy), and inflation. Over the past 3, 6 and 12 months, disposable income has run ahead of inflation. Part of this is because social security incomes got a big inflation-adjusted boost in January. But even employee compensation is running ahead of inflation. That‚Äôs really positive for consumer spending, which makes up 70% of the economy.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; # The big story: Housing inflation may finally be turning (lower) &gt; Core inflation, excluding food and energy, rose 0.4% in March. Over the past 3 months, core inflation is up 5.1% (annualized pace) and its up 5.6% over the past year. So, not much of a slowdown.  &gt; Part of the reason is that housing inflation has been running high.  &gt; But we got very good news on that front. Rents of primary residences and owners‚Äô equivalent rent (rental equivalent of owner-occupied homes) rose ‚Äúonly‚Äù 0.5%. While still high, that pace is the slowest monthly increase in a year. Over the past 9 months, housing inflation averaged about +0.7% per month, which translates to a whopping 9% annualized rate!  &gt; So, the slowdown in March is significant, and most welcome.  &gt; Of course, as we‚Äôve written about in the past, we‚Äôve already seen a sharp deceleration in market rents. It‚Äôs just that the official inflation data has been really slow to catch up to that reality. But that may be changing now and bodes well for core inflation to slow down across the rest of this year.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; # The bad news: Core inflation ex housing remains elevated &gt; That was the good news, i.e. a slowdown in energy, food and housing inflation. However, the rest of it still looks to be elevated.  &gt; For one thing, vehicle prices are no longer falling as fast as they were. Vehicle prices, especially for used cars, was another big factor in pulling inflation lower over the last few months. Used car prices fell 0.9% in March, but that‚Äôs the smallest decline in 7 months. Private data suggests that used car prices are rising again. New vehicle prices also rose 0.4%, breaking a recent downward trend.  &gt; Outside of vehicles, a lot of goods and services that were initially hit by the pandemic are still seeing significant price increases. These include goods like household furnishings and apparel, and services like hotels and airlines fares.  &gt; Even beyond that, services such as day care, personal care, and recreation, are seeing inflation running well above what we saw before the pandemic.  &gt; All of which is a sign that demand for these goods and services remains strong.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; # What does this mean for the Fed? &gt; Fed officials have explicitly said that they want to see core services ex housing decelerate. In short, they‚Äôre looking at inflation excluding energy, food and housing, the three categories where we‚Äôve had positive news. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs not much evidence that this slice of the inflation basket is decelerating, yet. The good news is that it tends to be correlated to wage growth, and there‚Äôs strong evidence that wage growth is moving closer to what we saw pre-pandemic.  &gt; Now, the Fed is unlikely to continue raising interest rates much further from here, especially since we had a banking crisis, and they may want to play cautious. Plus, as we wrote a few weeks ago, banks tightening credit in response to the crisis is akin to rate increases.  &gt; At the same time, they are likely to keep rates where they are until they see convincing evidence of inflation falling, especially core services ex housing inflation.  &gt; This is not what investors expect. Instead, investors expect the Fed to start cutting rates in late summer, pricing in at least 3 rate cuts by the end of 2023. Indicating that bond investors believe a crisis or recession is likely in the near-term. That‚Äôs clearly not where Fed officials are right now. We‚Äôre not there either, for now.  &gt; Eventually, market pricing and Fed officials‚Äô views must converge. In the meantime, expect volatility, especially in the bond market.  *****  &gt; # 10-Year 10-Baggers  &gt; Peter Lynch's 1989 book One Up On Wall Street introduced investors to the word "ten bagger," which represents an investment that appreciates by 10x (1,000%) its initial purchase price.  &gt; Today we wanted to highlight the stocks that have been "ten baggers" over the last ten years. In the Russell 1,000, 33 names are up more than 1,000% since April 12th, 2013. Over the same 10-year period, the S&amp;P 500 tracking ETF (SPY) is up 211%. As shown below, NVIDIA (NVDA) is up the most with a gain of 8,833%, followed by Tesla (TSLA) at 6,304% and then Plug Power (PLUG) at 5,477%.  &gt; There are 16 Technology stocks on the list of 33 ten baggers, which is the most of any sector. Other Tech stocks on the list include AMD, Enphase Energy (ENPH), Broadcom (AVGO), Fortinet (FTNT), Lam Research (LRCX), and even the two largest stocks in the US - Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT). Netflix (NFLX) is also another notable on the list with a gain of 1,266%.  &gt; Some other notables include Industrials stocks like Axon -- the maker of Tasers and police body cameras, Industrials stocks like Builders FirstSource (BLDR) and Old Dominion Freight (ODFL), and Vince VcMahon's World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), which is set to be bought by Endeavor Group (EDR).  &gt; Stocks that are already up 1,000%+ over the last ten years seem unlikely to repeat that over the next ten years. The obvious next question is: which stocks will be ten baggers over the next ten years? As Peter Lynch instructed, you'll have to do your research!  *****  &gt; # 3 Small Business Outlook Cratering  &gt;  Small business optimism continued to decline in March with the headline index from the NFIB falling from 90.9 down to 90.1. That headline reading was actually better than the consensus forecast of 89.3, but it was still in the bottom decile of the indicator's historical range dating back to 1986.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Looking across individual categories, breadth was weak in the report with only three indices moving higher month over month, three going unchanged, and all the others falling. As with the headline number, many categories are also historically depressed in the bottom decile of readings including a record low.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; That record low was in the percentage of respondents reporting now as a good time to expand. Only 2% reported now as a good time to expand, down 4 points month over month. Albeit the reading has been at the low end of its historical range for much of the past year, March's reading matched the historical low form March 2009.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Given the small business outlook for the economy has soured, fewer firms are reporting plans to increase hiring or capital expenditures. In fact, the index for capex plans fell to 20, which alongside March 2021, is the lowest reading since the spring of 2020. Similarly, hiring plans are at new lows for the post-pandemic period.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; One factor likely impacting business plans has been financial conditions. The most pronounced decline of any category last month was a record 4-point decline in the availability of loans. While the reading has been rolling over for some time, that drop leaves the index at the lowest level since December 2012.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Inflation Concerns Continue to Ease  &gt; In an earlier post, we mentioned the record-low reading in the percentage of small businesses perceiving now as a good time to expand. As for what these firms perceive to be their most pressing issues, inflation continues to be the single most prevalent answer at 24%, albeit the gap has narrowed dramatically. Quality of labor is now only a single percentage point behind at 23%, and when combined with cost of labor, the two issues account for over a third of small businesses' biggest problems. From a historical standpoint, those three readings all remain elevated and account for a massive share of the most pressing issues facing small businesses.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The four percentage point drop month over month in the percentage of respondents reporting inflation as their biggest issue is the largest decline since January when it had fallen 6 percentage points. As a result, the category is only down to the lowest level since January 2022 which remains well outside the range of pre-pandemic readings. In other words, inflation appears to be improving compared to last July when it was top of mind for 37% of small businesses, but it is still nowhere near a non-issue.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Picking up some of those losses has been government-related concerns. This series has historically held a political bias in which under Republican administrations small businesses are less concerned with red tape and taxes and vice versa during Democratic administrations. With the surge in inflation concerns during President Biden's tenure, this index has remained historically low but has begun to rise more recently as inflation has improved.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Another area to see a rise in firms reporting it as their biggest problem has been poor sales. While the reading is far from flying, it has begun trending higher accounting for 5% of responses in March. That pairs with the index for actual reported sales changes which have remained firmly negative for nearly a year now.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # 2023 Still Tracking Pre-Election Year Pattern But Gains May Be Muted  &gt; Despite the recent selloff and volatility S&amp;P 500 still tracks typical pre-election year market trends. However, uncertainties about rates, inflation, recession, banking and economic growth are likely to mute the usual pre-election year gains. A debt ceiling standoff could keep stocks under pressure during the Worst Six Months May-October.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; (*T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.*)  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  &gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).  &gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  # DISCUSS!

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023,;,; Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023.  # **Stocks close higher Friday as investors try to shake off latest bank fears: Live updates - [(Source)]( ***** &gt; Stocks rose Friday, reversing their earlier session declines as Deutsche Bank shares pared back some losses. ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 132.28 points, or 0.41%, closing at 32,238.15. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.57%, while Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.3%. The major indexes all had a winning week, with the Dow gaining 0.4% week-to-date as of Friday afternoon, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq gained 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively. ***** &gt; Deutsche Bank‚Äôs U.S.-listed shares slid 3.11% Friday, rebounding from a 7% drop earlier in the trading session. A selloff of shares was triggered after the the German lender‚Äôs credit default swaps jumped, but without an apparent catalyst. The move appeared to raise concerns once again over the health of the European banking industry. Earlier this month, Swiss regulators forced a UBS acquisition of rival Credit Suisse. Deutsche Bank shares traded off their worst levels of the session, which caused major U.S. indexes to also cut their losses. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think that the market overall is neither frightened nor optimistic ‚Äî it‚Äôs simply confused,‚Äù said George Ball, president at Sanders Morris Harris. ‚ÄúThe price action for the last month-and-a-half, including today, is a jumble without any direction or conviction.‚Äù ***** &gt; Ball added that Deutsche Bank is ‚Äúvery sound financially.‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIt could be crippled if there‚Äôs a big loss of confidence and there‚Äôs a run on the bank. There is, however, no fundamental reason why that should occur, other than nervousness.‚Äù ***** &gt; European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde tried to ease concerns, saying euro zone banks are resilient with strong capital and liquidity positions. Lagarde said the ECB could provide liquidity if needed. ***** &gt; Investors continued to assess the Fed‚Äôs latest policy move announced this week. The central bank hiked rates by a quarter-point. However, it also hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be ending soon. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that credit conditions have tightened, which could put pressure on the economy. ***** &gt; On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said regulators are prepared to take more action if needed to stabilize U.S. banks. Her comments are the latest among regulators attempting to buoy confidence in the U.S. banking system in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank closures. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúRetail [and] institutional investors are both looking at the banking system, but now internationally. That‚Äôs dangerous,‚Äù Ball added. ‚ÄúBanks exist because of confidence in their stability, and that confidence can be eroded as we now see, via social media and technology in a matter of minutes.‚Äù  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](   *****  &gt; # Best and Worst Stocks Since the COVID Crash Low  &gt; We are now three years out from the COVID Crash low, and even with the past year's weakness, most assets continue to sit on solid gains. For major US index ETFs, the S&amp;P Midcap 400 (IJH) is up the most having slightly more than doubled while the S&amp;P Smallcap 600 (IJR) is not far behind having rallied 95.9%. Value has generally outperformed growth, especially for mid and small-caps although that has shifted somewhat this year. For example, while its gains have been more middling since the COVID crash, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has been the strongest area of the equity market in 2023 thanks to the strength of sectors like Tech (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC). Although those sectors have posted strong gains this year, they have been the weakest over the past three years while Energy (XLE) far and away has been the strongest asset class. Paired with the strength of energy stocks has been solid runs in commodities (DBC)more broadly with the notable exception being Natural Gas (UNG) which has lost over 40%. Bond ETFs are similarly sitting on losses since the COVID Crash lows. As for international markets, Mexico (EWW) and India (PIN) have outpaced the rest of the world although Emerging Markets (EEM) as a whole have not been particularly strong; likely being dragged on by the weaker performance of China (ASHR) which holds a large weight on EEM.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Taking a look at current S&amp;P 500 members, nearly half of the index has more than doubled over the past three years. As for the absolute best performers, Energy stocks dominate the list with four of the top five best-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks coming from that sector. Targa Resources (TRGP) has been the absolute best performer with a nearly 900% total return. Other notables include a couple of heavy weight stocks: Tesla (TSLA) and NVIDIA (NVDA) with gains of 563.9% and 412.9%, respectively.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; On the other end of the spectrum, there are currently 25 stocks that have posted a negative return since the COVID Crash low. The worst has been First Republic Bank (FRC) which has been more of a recent development. Whereas today the stock has posted an 83.1% loss, at the start of this month it would have been a 65% gain. Another standout on the list of worst performers has been Amazon (AMZN). Most other mega caps have more than doubled since the March 2020 S&amp;P 500 low, however, the e-commerce giant has hardly offered a positive return.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Sector Performance Experiences a Historical Divergence  &gt; The first quarter of 2023 is coming to a close next week, and checking in on year to date performance, there has been a big divergence between the winners and losers. Although the S&amp;P 500 is up 2.84% on the year as of yesterday's close, only three of the eleven sectors are higher. Not only are those three sectors up on the year, but they have posted impressive double digit gains only three months into the year. Of those three, Consumer Discretionary has posted the smallest gain of 10% whereas Technology and Communication Services have risen 17.2% and 18.1%, respectively. The fact that these sectors are home to the main mega cap stocks -- like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have been on an impressive run of late -- helps to explain how the market cap weighted S&amp;P 500 is up on the year without much in the way of healthy breadth on a sector level.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; One thing that is particularly remarkable about this year's sector performance is just how rare it is for a sector to be up 10%+ (let alone 3) while all other sectors are lower. And that is for any point of the year let alone in the first quarter. As we mentioned in yesterday's Sector Snapshot and show in the charts below, going back to 1990, there have only been two other periods in which a sector has risen at least 10% YTD while all other sectors were lower YTD. The first of those was in May 2009. In a similar instance to now, Consumer Discretionary, Tech, and Materials were the three sectors with double digit gains back then. With those sectors up solidly, the S&amp;P 500 was little changed on the year with a less than 1% gain. As you can see below, though, by the end of 2009, every sector had pushed into positive territory as the new bull market coming out of the global financial crisis was well underway.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The next occurrence was much more recent: 2022. Obviously, it was a tough year for equities except for the Energy sector which had a banner year. Throughout most of the year, the sector traded up by well over 20% year to date even while the rest of the equity market was battered.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # The Fed Expects Banking Stress to Substitute for Rate Hikes  &gt; The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 0.25% at their March meeting, bringing it to the 4.75-5.0% range. This is the ninth-straight rate increase and brings rates to their highest level since 2007. However, the most aggressive tightening cycle since the early 1980s, which saw them lift rates all the way from near zero to almost 5%, is near its end.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Up until early February, Fed officials expected to raise rates to a maximum of about 5.1% and hold it there for a while. However, since that time, we‚Äôve gotten a slew of strong economic data, including elevated inflation numbers. This pushed fed officials to give ‚Äúguidance‚Äù that they expected to raise rates by more than they estimated back in December.  &gt; Market expectations for policy also moved in conjunction. Prior to February, markets expected the Fed to raise rates to 5% by June, and subsequently lower them by about 0.5% by the end of the year. But strong incoming data and Fed guidance pushed expectations higher, with the terminal rate moving up to 5.6% and no cuts in 2023.  &gt; # The Silicon Valley Bank crisis changed everything &gt; The bank crisis that erupted over the last couple of weeks resulted in a significant shift, both in expectations for policy and now the Fed as well. See here for our complete rundown on SVB and the ensuing crisis.  &gt; Market expectations for Fed policy rates immediately moved lower. Markets expected the stress in banks to translate to tighter credit conditions, which in turn would lead to slower economic growth and lower inflation.  &gt; This was nicely articulated by Professor Jeremey Siegel, one of the foremost commentators on financial markets and fed policy, in our latest episode of the Facts vs Feelings podcast, Prof. Siegel said that tighter credit conditions, as lending standards become more strict, are de facto rate hikes.  &gt; Fed Chair Powell more or less said exactly the same thing after the Fed‚Äôs March meeting. The 0.25% increase was an attempt to thread the needle between financial stability and fighting inflation. Fed officials also forecast the fed funds rate to hit a maximum of 5.1%, unchanged from their December estimate. This is a marked shift from what was expected just a few weeks ago, with Powell explicitly saying that tighter credit conditions ‚Äúsubstitute‚Äù for rate hikes.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; # There‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty ahead &gt; While the recent bank stresses are expected to tighten credit conditions and thereby impact economic growth and inflation, there are a couple of open questions:  &gt; * How big will the impact be?  &gt; * How long will the impact last?  &gt; These are unknown currently. Which means future policy is also unknown.  &gt; Fed officials expect to take rates to 5.1%, i.e., one more rate increase. And then expect to hold it there through the end of the year. In short, they don‚Äôt expect rate cuts this year.  &gt; Yet investors expect no more rate increases and about 0.6% of rate cuts in the second half of 2023. Markets expect the policy rate in June to be at 4.8%, while expectations for December are at 4.2%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; There‚Äôs clearly a huge gulf between what the Fed expects versus what investors expect. This will have to reconcile in one of two ways:  &gt; * Market expectations move higher ‚Äì if economic/inflation data remain strong and credit conditions don‚Äôt look to be tightening significantly.  &gt; * Fed expectations move lower ‚Äì if the banking sector comes under renewed stress, credit conditions could tighten significantly and eventually lead to weaker data.  &gt; Things are obviously not going to go in either direction in a straight line. It‚Äôs going to be a bumpy ride as new data points come in, not to mention news/rumors of renewed problems in the banking sector.  *****  &gt; # Seasonality Keeps Claims Below 200K?  &gt; Initial jobless claims remained healthy this week with another sub-200K print. Claims fell modestly to 191K from last week's unrevised reading of 192K. That small decline exceeded expectations of claims rising up to 197K. Given claims continue to impress, the seasonally adjusted number has come in below 200K for 9 of the last 10 weeks. By that measure, it has been the strongest stretch for claims since last April when there were 10 weeks in a row of sub-200K prints. Prior to that, from 2018 through 2020 the late March and early April period similarly saw consistent readings under 200K meaning that some of the strength in the adjusted number could be on account of residual seasonality.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; In fact, this point of the year has some of the weeks in which claims have the most consistently historically fallen week over week. Taking a historical median of claims throughout the year, claims tend to round out a short-term bottom in the spring before an early summer bump. In other words, seasonal strength will begin to wane in the coming months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; While initial claims improved, continuing claims worsened rising to 1.694 million from 1.68 million the previous week. Albeit higher, that remains below the 2023 high of 1.715 million set at the end of February.  *****  &gt; # A Fed Day Like Most Others  &gt; Yesterday's Fed decision and comments from Fed Chair Powell gave markets plenty to chew on. As we discussed in last night's Closer and today's Morning Lineup, there have been a number of conflicting statements from officials and confusing reactions in various assets over the past 24 hours. In spite of all that uncertainty, the S&amp;P 500's path yesterday pretty much followed the usual script. In the charts below we show the S&amp;P's average intraday pattern across all Fed days since Powell has been chair (first chart) and the intraday chart of the S&amp;P yesterday (second chart). As shown, the market's pattern yesterday, especially after the 2 PM ET rate decision and the 2:30 PM press conference, closely resembled the average path that the market has followed across all Powell Fed Days since 2018.  &gt; The S&amp;P saw a modest bounce after the 2 PM Fed decision and then a further rally right after Powell's presser began at 2:30 PM. That initial post-presser spike proved to be a pump-fake, as markets ultimately sold off hard with a near 2% decline from 2:30 PM to the 4 PM close.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; So what typically happens in the week after Fed days? Since 1994 when the Fed began announcing policy decisions on the same day as its meeting, the S&amp;P has averaged a decline of 10 basis points over the next week. During the current tightening cycle that began about a year ago, market performance in the week after Fed days has been even worse with the S&amp;P averaging a decline of 0.99%. However, when the S&amp;P has been down over 1% on Fed days (like yesterday), performance over the next week has been positive with an average gain of 0.64%. As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****   &gt; # What Now? An Update on Recent Bank Stress.  &gt; It‚Äôs been less than 2 weeks since Silicon Valley Bank‚Äôs stunning 48-hour collapse, and a few more banks have been caught in the fray. New York regulators closed the doors on Signature Bank on Sunday, March 12. A week later, US banks injected $30 billion into First Republic Bank to keep it afloat, and UBS acquired rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse in a government-brokered deal. In the midst of the chaos, your Carson Investment Research team was there for you with client-facing content, professional advice, and investment solutions. In fact, we think this event presents an opportunity to invest in the more stable large-cap financial companies and recently upgraded the sector to overweight in our House Views Advice.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; # Why is this happening? &gt; The rapid hike in interest rates caused an asset and liability mismatch for banks. Due to many years of low-interest rates, banks invested assets in interest-earning loans and bonds that would be repaid over the next five-plus years, which at the time was a logical way to earn a higher yield. Regulators considered government bonds to be among the safest ways a bank could invest its capital. As interest rates rose, bond values dropped. Interest rates rose at the fastest pace in history, and the safe assets that banks invested in lost value to the tune of more than $620 billion in unrealized losses as of the end of last year. This decline in value left weaker banks underwater and, when coupled with depositors pulling money out, caused them to collapse or seek costly capital raises.  &gt; # Why this matters to investors? &gt; The weakness in the banking sector will likely lead to tighter lending standards, potentially slowing economic growth. The reason we‚Äôre in this mess, to begin with, is that the Fed hiked interest rates to slow the economy because inflation was rising too quickly. Perhaps the 16% drop in oil prices over the past two weeks reflected this slower growth and bodes well for continued falling inflation. Thus, the Fed is closer to achieving its goal.  &gt; Maybe it‚Äôs an overreaction as ‚Äúbanking crisis‚Äù headlines stir painful memories of 2008. Either way, an environment with slower growth and lower inflation isn‚Äôt a bad time to invest. Bonds and stocks could both perform well, especially stocks of companies with the ability to grow earnings. We also reiterate our House Views Advice overweight on the large-cap Financials sector. The largest US banks are well-capitalized and are gaining market share from the smaller regional banks. We believe this calamity provides an opportunity for stronger banks and investors to capitalize on.  *****  &gt; # FANG+ Flying  &gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup, sector performance has heavily favored areas like Tech, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services in recent weeks. Playing into that sector level performance has been the strength of the mega-caps. The NYSE FANG+ index tracks ten of the largest and most highly traded Tech and Tech-adjacent names. In the past several days, that cohort of stocks is breaking out to the highest level since last April whereas the S&amp;P 500 still needs to rally 4% to reach its February high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Although FANG+ stocks have been strong recently, that follows more than a full year of underperformance. As shown below, relative to the S&amp;P 500, mega-cap Tech consistently underperformed from February 2021 through this past fall. In the past few days, the massive outperformance has resulted in a breakout of the downtrend for the ratio of FANG+ to the S&amp;P 500.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; More impressive is how rapid of a move it has been for that ratio to break out. Below, we show the 2-month percent change in the ratio above. As of the high at yesterday's close, the ratio had risen 22.5% over the prior two months. That comes up just short of the record (22.6%) leading up to the pre-COVID high in February 2020. In other words, mega-cap Tech has experienced near-record outperformance relative to the broader market. However, we would note that this is in the wake of last year when the group had seen some of its worst two-month underperformance on record with the worst readings being in March, May, and November.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # March Seasonality Prevails, Banking Fiasco Be Damned  &gt; It‚Äôs encouraging typical March seasonal patterns have overcome recent bank failures, recession talk and fearmongering. The early March pullback was steeper than normal, but the usual mid-month rebound appears to be materializing.  &gt; Last week‚Äôs gains could be an indication we have seen the worst of the banking fallout and the end of the pullback. Triple Witching Weeks have tended to be down in flat periods and dramatically so during bear markets. Positive March Triple Witching weeks in 2003 and 2009 confirmed the market was back in rally mode.  &gt; The week after March Triple Witching is notoriously nasty. S&amp;P is down 27 of the last 40 year ‚Äì and frequently down sharply. Positive or flat action this week would be constructive.  &gt; In the old days March used to come in like a bull and out like a bear. Nowadays March has evolved into an inflection point where short-term trends often change course. The market is clearly at an important juncture and it‚Äôs a good time to remember Warren Buffet‚Äôs wise words to ‚ÄúBe greedy when others are fearful.‚Äù  &gt; Bank failures are never a good thing, but the swift actions of regulators likely prevented further damage to the industry. At the least, the banks are likely to be under even greater scrutiny going forward. In the near-term we expect more volatile trading. Further out we expect the market, and the economy will recover like they both have historically done.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Nasdaq Leaves the S&amp;P in the Dust  &gt; Looking at the major US index ETF screen of our Trend Analyzer shows just how disconnected the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has become from other major index ETFs recently. As shown below, as of Friday's close, QQQ actually finished in overbought territory (over 1 standard above its 50-DMA) whereas many other major index ETFs were oversold, some of those to an extreme degree. On a year to date basis, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has rallied more than 14% compared to low single digit gains or losses for the rest of the pack.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Historically, the major indices, namely the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, tend to trade at similar overbought and oversold levels. In the chart below we show the Nasdaq 100 and S&amp;P 500's distance from their 50-DMAs (expressed in standard deviations) over the past five years. As shown, typically the two large cap indices have seen similar albeit not identical readings. That is until the past few weeks in which the two have diverged more significantly.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; On Friday there was more than 2 standard deviations between the Nasdaq's overbought 50-DMA spread and the S&amp;P 500's oversold spread. As shown in the chart below, that surpassed recent highs in the spread like the spring of 2020 to set the highest reading since October 2016.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Going back to 1985, the spread between the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 50-DMA spreads diverging to such a degree is not without precedent, but it is also not exactly common. Friday marked the 16th time that spread eclipsed 2 standard deviations for the first time in at least 3 months. Relative to those prior instances, the current overbought and oversold readings in both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are relatively middling. However, only the instance in early 2000 similarly saw the Nasdaq technically overbought (trading at least a standard deviation above its 50-DMA) while the S&amp;P 500 was simultaneously oversold (at least one standard deviation below its 50-DMA).  *****  Here are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  &gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).  &gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  # DISCUSS!

[Apple has gotten so big it‚Äôs almost overtaken France‚Äôs entire stock market,;,; Apple Inc., the world's most valuable publicly traded business, continues its amazing run, setting historic highs and approaching the market value of France's stock market. With a market capitalization of $3.1 trillion, Apple is larger than all but the six largest stock markets in the world. This isn't the first time Apple surpassed Paris in terms of value; they swapped places several times during the previous year's second-half selloff.  The French stock market is likewise at an all-time high, driven by luxury goods giants such as LVMH and Hermes International SCA. This spike followed a mid-summer slowdown but has resumed as data suggests that inflation is decreasing and there are no signs of a US recession.  A comparable economic backdrop in the United States has resulted in a returning rally in technology companies, with Apple rising more than 50% in 2023, adding over $1 trillion to the market capital. This represents a major shift from October when Apple faced pressure over revenue growth and sales in China.  Looking ahead, Wall Street predicts that Apple's sales will re-accelerate in 2024, due to a shown rebound in demand for smartphones, laptops, and PCs. This upward trend for Apple mirrored larger developments in the technology sector amid strong economic conditions and a positive outlook for the business.,;,; 2023-12-15 11:19:28]
[Apple launches its Pay Later service,;,;   Apple on Tuesday introduced Apple Pay Later, which will allow users to split purchases into four payments spread over the course of six weeks.  Affirm dropped 6% on the news.  Apple Pay Later users will be able to manage, track and repay their loans in their Apple Wallet, the company said in a release. Individuals can apply for Apple Pay Later loans of between $50 and $1,000 and use them for in-app and online purchases made through merchants that accept Apple Pay. Payments have no interest and no fees.  The Mastercard Installments program enables Apple Pay Later, so merchants that already accept Apple Pay will not need to make any changes to implement the software for their customers.  Users can apply for a loan within the Apple Wallet app without it affecting their credit score, Apple said. Once they select the amount they would like to withdraw, a soft credit pull will be conducted to make sure they are in ‚Äúa good financial position‚Äù to take on a loan, according to the release.  Apple will invite select people to access a prerelease version of Apple Pay Later on Tuesday, and the company said it plans to expand access to all eligible users in the coming months.  Approved users will see a ‚ÄúPay Later‚Äù option while using Apple Pay to check out online and in apps on iPhones and iPads. They will also be able to apply for a loan right at checkout. Apple said purchases using the software will be authenticated using Face ID, Touch ID or a passcode.  The company said users can see the amount due for their existing loans, as well as the total amount due in the next 30 days, in Apple Wallet. Users will be asked to link a debit card as their loan repayment method. Credit cards won‚Äôt be accepted.,;,; 2023-03-28 19:29:33]

[Apple wins bid to pause Apple Watch ban at US appeals court,;,; Apple scored a victory on Wednesday when a U.S. appeals court paused a government commission's import ban on some of the company's popular Apple smartwatches following a patent dispute with medical-technology firm Masimo.  The tech giant had filed an emergency request asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to halt the order after appealing the U.S. International Trade Commission's (ITC) decision that it had infringed Masimo's patents.  Masimo declined to comment on the court's decision, while Apple did not immediately respond.  A final decision could cost either company millions of dollars and potentially force a settlement or some kind of technological workaround by Apple, analysts said.  Masimo shares were down almost 4% following the decision, and Apple shares were largely flat.  "This is a big win for Apple that was unexpected by many given the legal issues involved in this patent battle," Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said. "Masimo now has a big fight ahead. We expect an appeals case in January to be a big moment."  In a four-paragraph ruling, the appeals court said it would halt the ban while it considers Apple's motion for a longer-term pause during the appeals process. The court gave the ITC until Jan. 10 to respond to Apple's request.  U.S. President Joe Biden's administration declined to veto the ban on Tuesday, allowing it to take effect. Apple asked for a pause of the ban later that day.  On Tuesday, Apple told the court that U.S. Customs and Border Protection is considering whether redesigned versions of its watches infringe Masimo's patents and can be imported. The customs agency has set a target date of Jan. 12 for its decision, Apple said.  Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees, stealing its pulse oximetry technology and incorporating it into Apple Watches.  The ITC barred imports and sales of Apple Watches with technology for reading blood-oxygen levels. Apple has included a pulse oximeter feature in its smartwatches starting with its Series 6 model in 2020.  Apple can also now sell the Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches in the U.S., after pausing sales last week due to the ITC decision. The watches had remained available at other retailers including Amazon, Best Buy, Costco and Walmart.  The ban did not affect the Apple Watch SE, a less-expensive model without a pulse oximeter. Previously sold watches also were not be affected by the ban.  If the import ban remains in place, it could cost Apple from high hundreds of millions of dollars to very low billions of dollars, Ben Bajarin, CEO of analyst firm Creative Strategies, said before the decision was announced.  "Going forward, it's absolutely certain they are going to have to take a different approach in future hardware to still enable this feature," he said of Apple.  A jury trial on Masimo's allegations against Apple in California federal court ended with a mistrial in May. Apple has separately sued Masimo for patent infringement in federal court in Delaware and called Masimo's legal actions a "maneuver to clear a path" for its own competing smartwatch.  Apple's wearables, home and accessory business, which includes the Apple Watch, AirPods earbuds and other products, brought in $8.28 billion in revenue during the third quarter of 2023, according to a company report.   2023-12-27 18:17:36]
[Apple stock closes at an all-time-high, added $1 trillion to its market cap in 2023,;,; Apple (AAPL) achieved a new record high yesterday, closing at $197.96, up 1.67% for the day.         The company consistently outperforms its peers and is one of only five US companies valued at over $1 trillion. Notably, on December 6, 2023, Apple surpassed a $3 trillion total market valuation.         Throughout 2023, Apple increased its market cap by $1 trillion, reaching a total valuation of $4 trillion expected in 2024 if the pace continues.         Other companies with over $1 trillion valuations include Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia. The gap between Apple and Microsoft is around $220 billion.         While these figures are interesting to observe, they don't mean much unless you're a stockholder. Apple's market cap is likely to reach $4 trillion in 2024 if its pace doesn't slow down, and with Apple Vision Pro on the horizon, anything is possible    ,;,; 2023-12-14 11:35:56]

[Tim Cook teases Apple AI announcement ‚Äòlater this year‚Äô,;,; Apple CEO Tim Cook teased that Apple may have an artificial intelligence announcement later this year during a call with analysts after the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings.  While Cook‚Äôs remarks on Thursday did not include many details, they did indicate that Apple wants to compete with Microsoft, Google, Amazon, OpenAI and other technology companies working on cutting-edge AI models that can generate text and images.  ‚ÄúAs we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future,‚Äù Cook said during a call with analysts. ‚ÄúThat includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we‚Äôre excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.‚Äù  Generative AI started drawing significant attention from technology companies and investors starting in 2022, after OpenAI released ChatGPT and image generators rapidly improved. Apple did not announce an advanced AI model last year, although the company has long invested in similar machine learning technology in its chips and software, which can, for example, identify people or pets inside photographs.  Apple typically announces new software in June at its annual developer‚Äôs conference, WWDC. Last year, the company announced an autocorrect feature for the iPhone keyboard based on a transformer-based language model, which shares the same underlying technology as GPT. But Apple never used the phrase ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù during the presentation, preferring the more academic term ‚Äúmachine learning.‚Äù  ‚ÄúLet me just say that I think there‚Äôs a huge opportunity for Apple with Gen AI and AI, without getting into more details and getting out in front of myself,‚Äù Cook said.

[Apple Unveils Vision Pro AR/VR Headset, Its First Major New Product In Nearly A Decade,;,; On Monday, Apple unveiled its much-anticipated mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro, the tech giant‚Äôs first major new product category since 2015‚Äôs Apple Watch.  The new device, packed with cameras and sensors, looks like a futuristic pair of ski goggles, and can immerse a wearer in virtual reality but also blend in the real-world elements of augmented reality. CEO Tim Cook announced the new product at the company‚Äôs Worldwide Developers Conference held at its sparkling Apple Park headquarters in Cupertino, CA.  Apple‚Äôs virtual reality plans date back roughly a decade, and Cook has been teasing his ambitions publicly for the better part of that time. As far back as 2016, the company filed patents for lightweight eyeglasses and a bulkier device. But while Cook reportedly preferred the more compact option, according to reports by Bloomberg, the technical challenge forced Apple to change its strategy.  The device announcement comes years after other Silicon Valley juggernauts including Meta and Google parent Alphabet have tried to bring high-tech headsets into the mainstream. Facebook in 2014 bought the startup Oculus for $2 billion and has released two generations of its Meta Quest, geared mostly toward gamers. Microsoft in 2016 made a big bet on its Hololens headset, a 3D augmented reality device, but has failed to gain traction with consumers. Google made the buzziest splash more than a decade ago with its disastrous Google Glass, a sleek headset with a camera on board. The product drew immediate outrage, with early adopters dubbed ‚Äúglassholes.‚Äù  Apple has rarely been first to new product categories, instead letting other companies take the lead while it developed products it hoped could dominate over rivals. Apple was beat to market in mp3 players, smartphones, tablets and smartwatches, but its iPods, iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches have all become category-defining devices.  Apple will have a bigger challenge ahead as it asks people to put its latest product directly on their faces for everyday use‚Äîan aim which has eluded all its well-capitalized predecessors. Today‚Äôs headsets often lead to people complaining about the devices overheating, being too heavy to wear for too long or leaving sweaty foreheads. Others have found the experience of being disconnected to the real world‚Äîimmersed in full-on virtual reality for long periods of time‚Äîtoo isolating. Cook said in an interview with GQ earlier this year that Apple‚Äôs device could increase collaboration, though Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs vision to achieve a similar effect in the workplace has failed to take off.   2023-06-05 18:29:40]
[Apple's Popularity With Gen Z Poses Challenges for Google/Android,;,;  Younger Americans prefer Apple over rival companies by significant margins, driving a generational shift toward Apple devices and social pressure, the [*Financial Times*]( reports.      According to the report, younger consumers are concerned about being socially ostracised for not having an [iPhone]( ‚Äì a phenomenon that is driving young people to buy other Apple products and services, leading to growing market share across multiple product categories.  Those born after 1996, also known as Gen Z, compose 34 percent of all ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå owners in the U.S., compared to just 10 percent for Samsung. For older generations, there is a relatively even split between ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå and Android users. The ramifications of this shift toward Apple devices among younger people extends beyond iPhones, with these users being much more likely to purchase AirPods, Apple Watches, and Macs.  For every 100 iPhones Apple sells around the world, it also sells 26 iPads, 17 Apple Watches, and 35 pairs of AirPods, according to research by Canalys. For Samsung, every 100 smartphone sales leads to fewer than 11 tablets, six smartwatches, and six pairs of wireless earbuds being sold. This is in spite of the fact that the average selling price of an ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå is almost three times that of an Android device.  Researchers who advise companies about the preferences of Gen Z consumers told the *Financial Times* that these customers are the most online of any age group, spending up to six hours a day on their smartphones. As a result, Apple's ecosystem is shaping social decision-making, with particular emphasis on the importance of iMessage as a social signal, necessitated by inferior experiences messaging and using group chats via SMS.  In Europe, where iMessage is less prevalent and Android has a bigger market share, the same trend is similarly visible.

[Apple launches its savings account with 4.15% interest rate,;,;   Apple on Monday launched its Apple Card savings account with a 4.15% annual percentage yield. It requires no minimum deposit or balance, Apple said, and users can set up an account from the Wallet app on their iPhones.  The company said in a press release that all Daily Cash rewards earned through the Apple Card will automatically be deposited to the savings account. Daily Cash is the Apple Card reward program that offers up to 3% back on purchases. Users can change where their Daily Cash is deposited at any time, and can also add additional funds from their bank account to build on their earnings.  Apple is launching the savings account through Goldman Sachs.  The national average APY on savings accounts is just 0.35%, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, so Apple‚Äôs 4.15% APY is high in comparison. But competing savings accounts offered by large credit unions, online banks and brick-and-mortar banks can also offer customers a significant APY.  CIT Bank offers a savings account with a 4.75% APY when customers deposit a minimum balance of $5,000. Marcus by Goldman Sachs has a 3.9% APY with no minimum balance or monthly fees. Capital One‚Äôs savings account has no minimum balance, and users can earn a 3.5% APY. Vio Bank offers a savings account with a 4.77% APY with no minimum balance.  Apple Card savings users can manage their accounts through a dashboard that will appear in the Wallet app, where they can track their interest and their account balance or withdraw funds.,;,; 2023-04-17 14:51:21]
[Microsoft Reportedly Tried to Sell Bing to Apple in 2020,;,; Microsoft executives tried to sell the company‚Äôs Bing search engine to Apple around 2020, pitching the deal as a way for the iPhone maker to replace Google as the default search engine in Apple‚Äôs Safari browser, Bloomberg reported. The talks never reached an advanced stage, according to the report.  The revelation comes as the U.S. Department of Justice seeks to prove to a federal judge that Google violated antitrust laws by abusing its dominance over the search market. Google‚Äôs deal with Apple to share ad revenue in exchange for default status in Safari, and whether that agreement made it impossible for challengers like Bing to compete, have been a key part of the ongoing antitrust trial in Washington. Microsoft‚Äôs alleged sale effort appears to bolster the government‚Äôs contention that Google locked up the market to the point where its top competitor was willing to throw in the towel. It also shows that Apple, the world‚Äôs most valuable company, preferred to stick with the Google deal than pick a costly battle in search.  [ 2023-09-29 08:00:36]

[(Bloomberg) Apple Vision Pro deliveries are delayed to March,;,; "*Apple Inc. began taking preorders for its long-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Friday, and early indications suggest that buyers are snapping up initial supplies of the $3,499 device.*         *The product went on sale at 8 a.m. Eastern time on Apple‚Äôs website and mobile app, ahead of its rollout on Feb. 2. Delivery dates for all three models quickly slipped to March 8-15 for online orders, and the device was sold out for in-store pickup on day one at many locations. The delay signals that either demand is strong or supplies are limited ‚Äî or something in between.*  *Apple shares gained as much as 1.8% to $191.95 Friday in New York, erasing most of its 2% decline for January.*         *With the launch, the company disclosed two additional configurations: a version with 512 gigabytes of storage for $3,699, and a top-end model with 1 terabyte of space for $3,899. The base model includes 256 gigabytes of storage. The company also said it would sell a carrying case for $199 and additional batteries for $199, while extra bands will cost $99 a piece.*         *The purchasing process for the Vision Pro is unique. Customers need to use a recent iPhone or iPad to scan their head and, if necessary, provide a vision prescription. Apple typically doesn‚Äôt comment on the sales performance of new products.*    *Wall Street analysts are predicting a slow start for the device. UBS Group AG analyst David Vogt expects Apple to ship 300,000 to 400,000 units this year, generating as much as $1.4 billion. For a company that had sales of $383 billion last year, that‚Äôs ‚Äúimmaterial.‚Äù*  *Still, the idea is to set the stage for something bigger. Apple is entering its first major new product category since the company began selling smartwatches in 2015, and the Vision Pro may take years to catch on. Apple will continue to refine the headset ‚Äî making it cheaper and more comfortable ‚Äî and find compelling applications for the device.*        *In the longer run, Apple could use a fresh moneymaker. The smartphone market has matured, and it‚Äôs under particular pressure in China. The company‚Äôs revenue has fallen for four straight quarters ‚Äî its longest streak of declines in more than two decades.*  *Initially, the Cupertino, California-based company only plans to sell the Vision Pro in the US, with launches in other markets coming in the months ahead. The company is eyeing the UK, Canada and China as some of the first other countries, Bloomberg News has reported.*        *It‚Äôs a complex product to manufacture, which could limit early supplies. The dual 4K resolution displays in the headset, which melds virtual and augmented reality, have suffered production snags. But the fact that Apple has been ramping up manufacturing for months suggests that it will be able to satisfy initial demand. The company is also offering a 25% discount on the device for employees, signaling that supplies aren‚Äôt too tight.*  *Inside Apple, executives are anticipating a strong opening weekend, with sales tapering off later. At $3,499, the Vision Pro is one of the priciest consumer headsets ever ‚Äî about seven times more expensive than the latest device from VR market leader Meta Platforms Inc.*        *The Vision Pro also will be a hard product to share with family and friends. It requires a precise fitting process to ensure a good experience. The face scan is designed to determine the best light seal and strap size for users. The company has prepared 25 different light seals ‚Äî a cushion that prevents light from seeping into the wearer‚Äôs field of view ‚Äî in addition to two straps. There also are prescription lens inserts, at an additional cost.*         *And the headset may be hard for some people to wear for extended periods. In early testing, some users have found it to be too heavy.*        *Another concern that‚Äôs cropped up in recent days is a lack of support from top streaming apps. Netflix Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Google‚Äôs YouTube are opting not to release software for the device, at least at launch.*        *But Apple has carefully refined its sales pitch for the headset. When consumers try it out at Apple retail stores, they‚Äôll get a 25-minute demo, letting them get comfortable with the 3D experience that the company calls ‚Äúspatial computing.‚Äù*        *To commemorate the launch, Apple executives Mike Rockwell and Alan Dye discussed the device in a Q&amp;A shared with employees this week.*        *A key focus, said Dye, was ensuring that the Vision Pro didn‚Äôt have a closed-in feel ‚Äî a complaint with VR headsets.*        *‚ÄúFrom the onset, we all had concerns about people sitting with their eyes covered and disconnected from the world,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt really became central to how we thought about the core principles of the product.‚Äù*        *That led to the EyeSight system, which can show a wearer‚Äôs eyes through a screen on the front of the Vision Pro. ‚ÄúIt was a huge technical challenge to do this in a way that looks and feels natural,‚Äù Rockwell said.*        *Apple also developed an interface that doesn‚Äôt require handheld accessories. Instead, it tracks eye movement and hand gestures. Users control the device by looking at an on-screen item and pinching their fingers together to select it.*        *One of the biggest selling points may be how easy it makes collaboration, Rockwell said. Users in far-flung locations can feel like they‚Äôre in the same place.*        *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the closest thing to being there in person that you can possibly have,‚Äù Rockwell said. ‚ÄúIt changes the way you collaborate and is very different from videoconferencing as we know it.‚Äù*  .................................  *  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2024-01-21 15:15:31]

[Apple beats estimates thanks to iPhone and services, but records fourth consecutive quarterly sales decline,;,; [  Apple     reported fourth fiscal quarter earnings on Thursday that beat analyst expectations for sales and earnings per share, but revealed that overall sales fell for the fourth quarter in a row. Every hardware business outside the iPhone declined year-over-year, with big drops in the iPad and Mac segments.         Apple highlighted stronger-than-expected 16% growth in its online services division to make up for weakness in hardware sales.          Apple shares fell less than 1% in extended trading.        Here‚Äôs how Apple did, versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations:         EPS: $1.46 per share, versus $1.39 per share expected     Revenue: $89.50 billion, versus $89.28 billion expected     iPhone revenue: $43.81 billion, versus $43.81 billion expected     Mac revenue: $7.61 billion versus $8.63 billion expected     iPad revenue: $6.44 billion, versus $6.07 billion expected     Wearables revenue: $9.32 billion, versus $9.43 billion expected     Services revenue: $22.31 billion, versus $21.35 billion expected     Gross margin: 45.2% versus 44.5% expected     Apple didn‚Äôt give formal guidance, but CFO Luca Maestri usually provides data points on the earnings call. Analysts are looking for $122.98 billion in revenue for the December quarter, which would be a return to year-over-year growth in Apple‚Äôs most important quarter.          Net income was $22.96 billion, versus $20.72 billion in net income a year ago. For Apple‚Äôs entire fiscal year, it reported $383.29 billion in sales, down about 3% from Apple‚Äôs fiscal 2022. Quarterly revenue declined less than 1% in the September quarter.         The company‚Äôs iPhone sales were in line with Wall Street expectations and increased more than 2% from last year. It was the only hardware line for Apple to show growth in the quarter, and the period only included about a week of iPhone 15 sales.          Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC that the iPhone 15 was doing better than the iPhone 14 did during the September quarter last year.          ‚ÄúIf you look at iPhone 15 for that period of time and compare it to iPhone 14 for the same time in the year-ago quarter, iPhone 15 did better than iPhone 14,‚Äù Cook told CNBC‚Äôs Steve Kovach. He added that Apple‚Äôs more expensive Pro and Pro Max iPhones were supply constrained because of high demand.          Apple‚Äôs Mac and iPad businesses both suffered during the quarter. Maestri, Apple‚Äôs CFO, had warned on a call with analysts after third-quarter results that iPad and Mac sales would fall by double-digit percentages.         Mac sales came in below Wall Street expectations, falling nearly 34% on an annual basis. Apple held an unusual nighttime launch event for its new MacBook Pro laptops and iMac desktop last month. While sales of the new devices aren‚Äôt included in the quarter, Apple was signaling that new products could boost sales once again thanks to its new M3 chips.         Cook told CNBC that the Mac comparison is to ‚Äúan all-time record‚Äù fourth quarter, which followed a huge supply disruption and pushed what would have been third-quarter sales into the last quarter of 2022. ‚ÄúSo, the comparison point here is very difficult,‚Äù he said.         ‚ÄúI think the Mac is going to have a significantly better quarter in the December quarter. We‚Äôve got the M3, we‚Äôve got the new products, and we don‚Äôt have the compare phenomenon on a year-over-year basis,‚Äù Cook said, referring to an unusually strong market for Macs in 2022.          Cook said that that overall market for personal computers is ‚Äúchallenging.‚Äù         Revenue from iPads was also down big, declining 10% from the same period last year. Apple did not announce new products ahead of the holiday season this year.          Apple‚Äôs services business was a bright spot. Apple recorded $22.31 billion in services revenue, outpacing analyst expectations and increasing over 16% on an annual basis.          Apple‚Äôs services division includes online subscriptions like iCloud storage and Apple Music, as well as warranties from AppleCare. A big chunk of Apple‚Äôs services business comes from its deal with Google for the default search engine on Apple‚Äôs browser, Safari, which has been highlighted in recent weeks as part of the Department of Justice antitrust case against Google. That payment to Apple is worth an estimated $19 billion this year.         Cook said services components including App Store sales, advertising (including the Google deal), iCloud, payment services, and Apple Music did well in the quarter and hit an internal Apple record, signaling continued growth.         ‚ÄúEvery main service hit a record,‚Äù Cook said.          Maestri also noted in a statement that Apple‚Äôs installed base of devices, or the number of iPhones, Macs, and iPads currently in active use, reached an all-time high during the quarter, although Apple did not give an exact number. Analysts say that growth in Apple‚Äôs installed base signals future growth in its services division.          Cook said that Apple had over a billion paid subscriptions, which include both Apple‚Äôs own services as well as apps on the App Store that bill on a recurring basis.          Apple‚Äôs wearables business unit includes headphones like the company‚Äôs AirPods as well as Apple Watch sales. It, too, shrank year-over-year, dropping over 3% on an annual basis.          Apple‚Äôs business in Greater China, its third largest market, is under the microscope as investors worry about increased competition from Huawei. Greater China sales were basically flat year-over-year, and Apple reported $15.08 billion from the region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.          Apple said it would pay a dividend of 24 cents per share this month and said the company had spent $25 billion during the quarter on share repurchases and dividends.  ,;,; 2023-11-02 20:34:03]
[Meta, Microsoft and Amazon team up on maps project to crack Apple-Google duopoly,;,;   Google and Apple dominate the market for online maps, charging mobile app developers for access to their mapping services. The other mega-cap tech companies are joining together to help create another option. A group formed by Meta, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, along with TomTom, is releasing data that could enable companies to build their own maps, without having to rely on Google or Apple. The Overture Maps Foundation, which was established late last year, captured 59 million ‚Äúpoints of interest,‚Äù such as restaurants, landmarks, streets and regional borders. The data has been cleaned and formatted so it can be used for free as the base layer for a new map application.  Meta and Microsoft collected and donated the data to Overture, according to Marc Prioleau, executive director of the OMF. Data on places is often difficult to collect and license, and building map data requires lots of time and staff to gather and clean it, he told CNBC in an interview. ‚ÄúWe have some companies that, if they wanted to invest to build the map data, they could,‚Äù Prioleau said. Rather than spending that kind of money, he said, companies were asking, ‚ÄúCan we just get collaboration around the open base map?‚Äù Overture is aiming to establish a baseline for maps data so that companies can use it to build and operate their own maps.  For many companies, Google‚Äôs and Apple‚Äôs maps aren‚Äôt ideal, because they don‚Äôt provide access to the underlying data. Instead, those companies allow app makers to use their maps as a service and, in many cases, charge each time the underlying map is accessed. For example, app makers pay per thousand Google Maps lookups through an application programming interface (API). Apple allows access to Apple Maps for free for native app developers, but web app developers need to pay. ‚ÄúThat works for a lot of people, but not for others,‚Äù Prioleau said. Overture is only offering the underlying map data, leaving it up to companies to build their own software on top of it.,;,; 2023-07-26 17:13:04]

Google pays Apple more than a third of its search advertising revenue from Safari under the terms of the two companies‚Äô search default agreement, an Alphabet  witness said in open court Monday amid a protracted antitrust battle between Google and the Department of Justice.  The 36% figure, which was not previously known to the public, is one of the clearest indications of how lucrative Google‚Äôs search deal has been for both Apple and the search engine company. Both companies have fought to limit revealing the deals‚Äô details, citing potentially anticompetitive effects.  The incidental disclosure from Alphabet‚Äôs expert witness Kevin Murphy, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, was not expected. Murphy‚Äôs testimony came as part of the company‚Äôs efforts to fight the Justice Department‚Äôs claims that the company illegally maintains dominance over search and advertising markets.  Williams &amp; Connolly antitrust partner John Schmidtlein visibly cringed when Murphy revealed the number, Bloomberg News reported.  The search default agreement is a major focus of the proceedings. Judge Amit Mehta has described the Apple-Google deal as the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the case. It‚Äôs a number Wall Street pays attention to as well. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi has estimated in a note to clients that Apple would see $19 billion in 2023 revenue as a result of the search engine default deal with Google.  Neither Apple nor Google immediately responded to a request for comment.  Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai defended such deals when he testified in the proceedings. But Google‚Äôs competitors have described the arrangement as damaging to their business. Microsoft  CEO Satya Nadella, for example, pushed back in detail when he testified in October.  Nadella said that ‚Äúevery year‚Äù he had held the top job at Microsoft, he had ‚Äúdialogues‚Äù with Apple over a default search engine deal for Microsoft‚Äôs Bing, even if that meant billions in short-term losses. Nothing had yet come of those talks, Nadella said.

Nancy Pelosi's husband exercised roughly $2.6 million worth of Apple and Microsoft stock options this month, according to a regulatory disclosure Thursday.        The transactions on the filing, marked with "SP" for the spouse, indicate that Paul Pelosi bought 5,000 shares of both Apple and Microsoft stocks on June 15, exercising 50 call options purchased on May 24, 2022, with a listed expiration date of June 16.        The Apple options had a strike price of $80, and the Microsoft options had a strike price of $180. On Friday, those shares closed at $186.68 and $335.02, respectively, totaling about $933,000 and $1.7 million.        Since the options were purchased last May, Apple shares have gained 33%, and Microsoft has climbed 29%. The upside from the strike price is even higher, at 131% and 83%, respectively.        First highlighted by Quiver Quantitative and Unusual Whales, the disclosure comes after Congress failed to make progress on new legislation around lawmakers and their relatives trading stocks.        Earlier this year, Insider and several other news organizations identified 78 members of Congress who didn't properly report their financial trades as mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012, also known as the STOCK Act.        Congress passed the law a decade ago to combat insider trading and conflicts of interest. But many lawmakers have not fully complied with reporting requirements, leading to calls for a complete ban on trading individual stocks among members of Congress.        Legislation on such a ban advanced last year, but the bill ultimately died.        Meanwhile, Paul Pelosi has faced backlash over stock trades that seem to coincide with legislation in the technology sector.        For example, in July 2021, he pocketed a $4.8 million gain in a Alphabet stock trade the week before the House Judiciary Committee advanced bipartisan antitrust bills targeting Google, Apple, and Amazon.

[Will Apple be a $4 trillion dollar stock by 2024?,;,; * Apple‚Äôs market cap rose from $1 trillion in 2018 to $3 trillion in 2022. * Reaching the $4 trillion market cap by 2024 could be very challenging. * New products, services, and acquisitions could help it reach that milestone.      # The law of large numbers hasn't caught up to Apple yet.   Apple ($AAPL) became the first publicly traded U.S. company to hit a $1 trillion market cap in August 2018. It also became the first to cross the $2 trillion mark in August 2020, and the first to reach the $3 trillion milestone in January 2022.        Apple's market cap is still hovering near the $3 trillion mark as of this writing, but could it maintain its biennial tradition and hit a $4 trillion market cap by 2024? Let's review its past growth, projected growth rates, and valuations to decide.  # How did Apple become a $3 trillion company?   Between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2022 (which ended last September), Apple's annual revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.5%. Meanwhile, its split-adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew at an even higher CAGR of 21.6%.        In other words, Apple's annual EPS nearly tripled from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2022 -- so it makes sense that its stock price nearly quadrupled over the past five years. However, Apple's valuations have also risen at a faster rate than its actual profits. On the last day of fiscal 2017, Apple's stock traded at $154.12 ($38.53 on a split-adjusted basis), which was only 13 times the diluted EPS of $11.91 it would generate in fiscal 2018. Today, Apple trades at 28 times forward earnings.  Apple's path from $1 trillion to $3 trillion was paved by both its own EPS growth and its rising valuations. Its earnings growth was driven by its robust sales of iPhones (which still account for over half its revenue), iPads, Macs, and the expansion of its services segment with more subscription-based services. Its valuations rose as more investors turned to Apple as a safe-haven bet while the pandemic, the Russo-Ukrainian war, inflation, and rising interest rates rattled the broader markets.   Apple's EPS also usually grows at a faster clip than its net income because it buys back billions of dollars in shares every year. It repurchased 19% of its shares over the past five years, as well as a whopping 38% of its shares over the past decade.  #  How could Apple become a $4 trillion company?   For Apple to reach a $4 trillion market cap by the end of 2024, its stock would need to rise nearly 40% over the next 18 months. That could be quite difficult, for two simple reasons.        First, analysts expect Apple's EPS to dip 2% in fiscal 2023, rise 9% in fiscal 2024, and grow 10% to $7.17 per share in fiscal 2025. Assuming Apple still trades at 28 times forward earnings by the beginning of fiscal 2025, its stock would only be trading 9% higher at about $200 -- which would give it a market cap of just under $3.2 trillion.        Second, Apple's valuations are historically high -- so I could see its forward multiple drop back to 20 during a market downturn. If that happens, Apple's stock could decline to the mid-$140s, and its market cap would shrink to about $2.2 trillion.  # Pay attention to the wild cards  Based on analysts' estimates, should take with a grain of salt, it seems unlikely that Apple will reach a $4 trillion valuation by the end of 2024. However, those forecasts don't account for all the wild cards that Apple can still play.         Apple's upcoming rollout of the Vision Pro headset in early 2024 will mark its first major hardware launch since its introduction of the Apple Watch in 2015. Its high price tag of $3,500 might limit its initial appeal, but a stronger-than-expected launch could drive analysts to boost their revenue and earnings estimates.        Apple also ended its latest quarter with 975 million paid subscriptions across all of its services, which represented 18% growth from a year ago. That massive audience gives it plenty of room to launch new apps and services.        Lastly, Apple is still sitting on $166 billion in cash and marketable securities. It could deploy a lot of that cash on fresh investments and acquisitions (perhaps on media companies for its services ecosystem or some chipmakers for its first-party chips).   # Look beyond Apple's market cap   I believe Apple will eventually be worth $4 trillion one day, but I don't expect it to reach that milestone by the end of 2024. Instead, investors should simply recall that Apple generates stable growth, commands fierce customer loyalty, locks in its customers with sticky services, and rewards its patient investors with buybacks and dividends. All of those strengths make Apple a great long-term investment -- regardless of how much the entire company is actually worth.,;,; 2023-06-20 10:28:39]
[Global PC shipments slide in Q1, Apple takes biggest hit - IDC,;,; Global shipments of personal computers (PCs) fell by 29 per cent in the first quarter of 2023 due to weak demand, excess inventory and a deteriorating macroeconomic climate, with Apple Inc taking the largest hit, market research firm IDC said.  In the report published Sunday, the International Data Corporation (IDC) said global PC shipments numbered 56.9 million in the first quarter of this year, down from 80.2 million in the same period last year.  The shipments extended a similar year-on-year decline of 28.1 per cent in the last quarter of 2022.  Of the top five PC companies analysed in the report, Apple's Q1 shipments saw the largest drop of 40.5 per cent from the same period in 2022, with Dell Technologies Inc coming in second with a drop of 31 per cent.  Lenovo Group Ltd, Asustek Computer Inc and HP Inc also faced declines in shipments, the IDC said.  In February, Apple reported that sales of its Mac computers, which had boomed during the wave of working from home during the pandemic, declined 29 per cent YoY to $7.7 billion in their most recent quarter.  "The preliminary results also represented a coda to the era of COVID-driven demand and at least a temporary return to pre-COVID patterns. Shipment volume in Q1 2023 was noticeably lower than the 59.2 million units shipped in Q1 2019 and 60.6 million in Q1 2018," IDC said.  "The pause in growth and demand is also giving the supply chain some room to make changes as many factories begin to explore production options outside China."  Concerns over slowdowns in major economies remain, with recent tumult in the banking sector exacerbating worries that runaway inflation and tight monetary policy would hamper growth and financial investments.  If the economy is trending upwards by 2024, "we expect significant market upside as consumers look to refresh, schools seek to replace worn-down Chromebooks, and businesses move to Windows 11," said Linn Huang, research vice president, Devices and Displays at IDC.  "If recession in key markets drags on into next year, recovery could be a slog."   2023-04-10 07:40:48]

[Apple TV Plus and Paramount Plus reportedly discussing cheap bundle plan to take on Netflix,;,;   According to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), two of the world's most underrated streamers have held talks about creating a cost-effective bundle to put a stop to Netflix's dominance of the streaming landscape. People familiar with the discussions reportedly told the WSJ that Apple TV Plus and Paramount Plus aren't just looking to end Netflix's reign as the world's best streaming service. Per the US outlet's sources, the duo are also said to want to offer their services as a joint enterprise in a bid to save people money. Indeed, the two companies are believed to have had meaningful dialog about offering said bundle at a cheaper price than subscribing to both streamers separately ‚Äì a deal that would surely pique the interest of customers operating on a budget.  If the WSJ's report is correct ‚Äì the outlet is keen to stress talks are still in the early stages ‚Äì the potential bundling of Paramount Plus and Apple TV Plus into a single package could have a big impact on the wider streaming industry. For one, the world's eight biggest streamers have all raised their prices over the past 12 months ‚Äì some, such as Disney Plus and Max, have done so twice in less than a year in the US. That's placed undue pressure on people who are subscribed to multiple services, with many forced to choose which one (or, at a push two) to stay with as the cost of living continues to bite.  The bundling of Paramount and Apple's platforms, then, would be seen as a significant move. Like their rivals, the pair have increased their subscription fees in 2023 ‚Äì Apple TV Plus' major price hike was particularly irksome to me ‚Äì and, while each one has some great content to offer customers, their back catalogs aren't on a par with Netflix, Prime Video, or even Hulu. Apple TV Plus' library only consists of first-party (albeit mostly terrific) offerings, while Paramount Plus doesn't have the strength in depth from first and third-party perspectives to compete with the world's most popular services.,;,; 2023-12-01 18:01:48]
[The founder of Apple's key supplier said the US stock market would collapse in '10 seconds' if war breaks out in Taiwan.,;,; Foxconn founder Terry Gou said the US stock market would crash in 10 seconds if war were to break out over Taiwan. He said Taiwan's role in the global economy is far more important than that of Ukraine.  China claims self-ruled Taiwan ‚Äî the world's top chip supplier ‚Äî as its territory. Get the inside scoop on today‚Äôs biggest stories in business, from Wall Street to Silicon Valley ‚Äî delivered daily.  The founder of a key Apple supplier warned of disaster on Wall Street should a war break out over Taiwan.  "If a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait, it wouldn't take a month or even an hour, but just 10 seconds for the Wall Street stock market to collapse," Taiwanese billionaire Terry Gou wrote on Facebook on Wednesday, according to an Insider translation. His post appears to have been deleted by Thursday morning, although a cached copy of the post remains.  Gou, the 72-year-old founder of the contract manufacturing giant Foxconn, wrote the post after meeting New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman on the same day.  He said he told Friedman that Taiwan's role in the global economy is far more important than that of Ukraine, which is now embroiled in a war with Russia. China claims self-ruled Taiwan ‚Äî the world's top chip supplier ‚Äî as its territory and has been ramping up military drills around the island.  Gou added Taiwan may be able to hold out in a war for three months, but the impact on the world's economy and financial markets would be huge and immediate.  Gou founded Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, in 1974. He is worth nearly $7.2 billion, with a substantial portion of his wealth derived from a 12.6% stake in the publicly traded division of Foxconn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  The tycoon's comments about geopolitical tensions over the Taiwan Strait come amid speculation over his political ambitions.  The business magnate stepped down as Foxconn's chairman in 2019 in a bid to run for Taiwan's presidency, but dropped out of the race after he failed to win the nomination of KMT, Taiwan's main opposition party. He tried again this year, but again failed to win the party's nomination.  Some analysts think Gou may still make a run for the island's top job, the South China Morning Post reported on July 18.  Gou did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider sent to his verified Instagram account.  The Taiwan presidential election is scheduled to take place on January 13, 2024.     2023-08-03 14:09:32]
[Apple stock analysis and valuation - Why Warren Buffett loves it,;,; This week‚Äôs casual valuation is Apple. I hope you enjoy these posts and feel free to add your take.  *Disclaimer: I do not own shares in Apple.*  &amp;#x200B;  The post is divided into the following sections:  ‚Ä¢	Introduction  ‚Ä¢	Historical financial performance  ‚Ä¢	The balance sheet  ‚Ä¢	Assumptions and valuation  ‚Ä¢	Valuation based on different assumptions (and discount rate)  &amp;#x200B;  **Introduction**  Apple is the largest public company with a market cap of almost $3 trillion. We can go look back at its history and admire its outstanding performance, but even if we take a look at the last 5 years, its share price is up over 300%! For comparison, S&amp;P500 is up 60% over the same period.  My one-sentence summary of Apple would be ‚Äì **A technology company with strong brand and pricing power.**  At the end of March 2023, Apple was 46% of Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs portfolio.  Since Q1/2016 until today, Berkshire has bought over a billion shares in Apple at an average price of $39.65, leading to a total cost of almost $42 billion. Out of all the shares bought, 123 million have been sold for $12.5 billion, and the remaining 916 million shares have a market value of $171 billion. This leads to a return of 346%, excluding dividends.  &amp;#x200B;  **Historical financial performance**  Since 2017, Apple provides a split of its revenue into:  &amp;#x200B;  * Products (iPhone, iPad, AirPods, Mac, Apple TV, Apple Watch, etc.) * Services (Advertising, Cloud, Digital content, App store fees, Payment services, etc.)  Why is this relevant? Well, services naturally have higher margins.  If we take a look at the data related to this split, we'll see that the % of revenue generated from services increased from 14% back in 2017, to 21% today.  This is an important piece of the valuation puzzle. The assumptions regarding future profitability depend on the assumptions about how this will develop in the future. If the trend continues and services increase as % of revenue, then **higher profitability should be expected**. If the trend reverses, then **lower profitability should be expected.**  Many analysts point to iPhone as the biggest risk. Back in 2017, iPhone sales were responsible for 62% of all of Apple's revenue. Over the last twelve months, that % is down to 52%. It is still significant and it should not be ignored. If Apple disappoints with the next iPhone model, it will have a significant impact on its profitability, and valuation. It can also be argued that the new models aren't significantly better than the previous ones and come with slight design changes and limited additional features. However, as long as the customers are willing to pay for them, well, that's what matters.  &amp;#x200B;  Let's take a look at the financials and how they've changed over the last 5 years.  The gross profit increased from 38% in 2019 to 43% for the last twelve months (ending April 1st, 2023). Based on the development of the mix between products/services, this doesn't come as a surprise.  The operating expenses (Research &amp; Development, and Selling, General &amp; Administrative) have been incredibly stable, between 13-14% (combined) of revenue. Many investors love predictability, and Apple definitely delivers that.  All of the above translates to an increase in the operating margin from 25% back in 2019 to 29% over the last twelve months.  With revenue of $385 billion, Apple is generating over $100 billion in operating profit per year.  More importantly, during this period, there were two events that impacted most of the companies:  **The pandemic (Covid-19)** and **high inflation.**  We cannot see any negative impact coming from these events on Apple's financials. It continued to perform exceptionally even through uncertain and difficult times. The increased costs (due to raw materials, but also higher employee salaries) were successfully passed on to the final customers.  It doesn't come as a surprise that Warren Buffett loves it. What is there not to love?  &amp;#x200B;  **The balance sheet**  So, what happens with all of the excess cash that is consistently being generated? It is being returned back to the shareholders, via share buybacks and dividends.  Over the last decade, Apple reduced the # of outstanding shares by a third. In addition, its annual dividend payment is over $14 billion per year.  The decision to return cash back to the shareholders is basically the management admitting that they don't have projects to invest in, that will yield acceptable returns. Whether buybacks are the way to go at today's share price, is another question.  If we take a look at the balance sheet, the company has $180 billion of cash, short and long-term investments. Although this might sound impressive, this is roughly 5% of their market cap.  On the other side of the balance sheet, there's $110 billion in debt (including leases).  &amp;#x200B;  **Assumptions and valuation**  Here are my assumptions for the future:  **Revenue growth:** 7% per year over the next 3 years, then declining over time to 4%. With this assumption, revenue in 10 years' time increases by 71%  **Operating margin:** 29%, increasing to 32% over the next decade (I expect services to increase as % of revenue, leading to higher margins)  **Discount rate:** 11% discounting to 8.7% over time  &amp;#x200B;  After adjusting for what is on their balance sheet, as well as the equity options outstanding, the value of Apple is roughly **$2 trillion ($127.24/share).**  For comparison, today‚Äôs market cap is 2.94 trillion ($186.68/share).  &amp;#x200B;  **Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**  The future is uncertain and my assumptions could be significantly wrong. Let's take a look at how the valuation (per share) changes if we use different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now as well as the operating margin.  &amp;#x200B;  |Revenue / Operating margin|28%|30%|32%|34%|CAGR| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |50% ($578b)|$101.9|$108.7|$113.9|$119.6|4.1%| |71% ($657b)|$113.7|$121.4|$127.2|$133.8|5.5%| |100% ($770b)|$128.5|$137.3|$144.2|$151.8|7.2%| |160% ($999b)|$155.0|$169.1|$177.9|$187.6|10.0%|  For Apple to be fairly valued, it needs to grow its revenue at 10% annually over the next decade and increase its operating margin from its current 29% to 34%.  At the moment, the market is paying a significant premium for Apple and there is positive sentiment around the company.  Overall, I do like the company, and I can see myself buying shares at a reasonable price. It is quite clear that Buffett got a great deal by buying shares at an average price of $39.65.  &amp;#x200B;  As always, thank you for reading the post and for all the support.,;,; 2023-06-25 14:06:46]

[Apple (AAPL) to Spend Billions More on Entertainment,;,; From [Investopedia](  "Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.  KEY TAKEAWAYS Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.  The company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.  Previously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.  The move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.  Apple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release.  The company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.  The company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.  The new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).  Apple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.  So far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.  Apple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year.  In each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.  Apple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed."  Personally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain. Sounds like a win win win to me and we all know Apple has $billions in pocket change to throw at this.,;,; 2023-03-28 09:45:06]

[Considering investing into Apple, but...,;,; So assuming the research I've done is correct, and up to date, it seems that the total market cap in the US is 46.2 Trillion.

If, like some analysts project, and Apple's shares 10x in value over the next 10-20 years, then it's market cap would too, correct? (Since Market Cap = # of Shares x Current Stock Price).     I guess my questions are, is it even possible at this point for Apple to grow that much more? Since it's percentage would be so high compared to the total market cap? And if so, how high can it go?

[Apple iPhone maker Foxconn being investigated in China as founder runs for Taiwan presidency,;,;    Taiwan‚Äôs Foxconn, one of Apple‚Äôs largest suppliers, is being investigated by authorities in China, according to state media. The probe comes weeks after founder Terry Gou announced his bid for Taiwan‚Äôs presidency and stressed that he won‚Äôt be pressured by Beijing, despite his extensive business operations in the country. While it is unclear whether the investigations are connected to Gou‚Äôs entrance into the presidential race, analysts said the move will send jitters through foreign businesses in China. On Sunday, the state-owned Global Times reported that tax authorities had recently audited Foxconn‚Äôs key subsidiaries in the provinces of Guangdong and Jiangsu, where it has major factories. The natural resources ministry had also investigated the company‚Äôs use of land in Henan and Hubei provinces, it reported, citing anonymous sources. Foxconn said in statement sent to CNN that complying with the law was one of its ‚Äúbasic principles.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe will actively cooperate with the relevant units on the related work and operations,‚Äù it added. Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, has iPhone factories in Guangdong and Henan, including the world‚Äôs largest in the city of Zhengzhou.  The company‚Äôs listed unit in Shanghai, Foxconn Industrial Internet, plummeted by its daily limit of 10% on Monday. Parent firm Foxconn Technology, which is listed in Taipei, fell more than 2%.

[The Future of Apple: Time for a Reality Check or a Steady Hold?,;,; The tech community is buzzing with opinions about Apple‚Äôs latest release, the iPhone 15, and it's clear that the reception has been more tepid than previous iterations. As long-time Apple investors, we've enjoyed the highs of groundbreaking releases, but is it time for a reality check? Is AAPL overpriced, or are we merely on the cusp of another wave of innovation that will take the stock to new heights?  ## Mild Reception for iPhone 15  Even the most avid iPhone users appear somewhat unimpressed with the latest features. The question that looms is whether Apple has reached a plateau in terms of smartphone innovation. After all, how much better can a phone camera get? Is faster processing power enough to justify upgrading?  ## AAPL Stock in Rough Waters  The stock has been wobbly, and many are wondering if a market correction is overdue. The high valuation of AAPL stock might seem unwarranted based on current product releases. So, should investors cut and run or stick around for the next big thing?  ## Hidden Potential: Siri and LLm  While it's easy to focus on tangible products, let's not forget Apple's potential in software and services. Rumors of significant Siri improvements and the much-talked-about LLm feature could turn the tide for the tech giant. We've seen how software services like Apple Music and the App Store have become significant revenue streams; could a next-gen Siri do the same?  ## Never Rule Out Innovation  Apple has always been a frontrunner in technology. Whether it's introducing the first iPhone or changing the way we listen to music with the iPod, Apple has continually set new industry standards. As investors, perhaps what we need is not skepticism but patience.   So, to my tech industry peers and fellow Apple stockholders, I'm eager to hear your thoughts. Is it time to be wary, or should we hold on for what could be another exciting chapter in Apple's story?,;,; 2023-09-16 08:38:02]
[Apple Silicon Endgame ($AAPL),;,; I'm gaming out what Apple silicone looks like 5-10 years down the line. Generally I'm a big user of Apple products but they have definitely been getting expensive recently largely from Apple's push in vertical integration of semiconductors. Each generation of M series chip has lasted 1-2 years making the rate at which Apple is improving astonishing but also means their costs are rising quickly.  It's common knowledge that semiconductors get more expensive to manufacture as their architectural complexity increases. This is understood as the cost of being at the bleeding edge of the industry and is representative through many avenues including R&amp;D. Exact numbers are difficult to grasp because  Apple has been constantly in a state of new chip development for the past 3-4 years. With the trend that generally people will be buying "big ticket" electronics like laptops and phones with less frequency moving forward, there will be a point where it is no longer viable for Apple to improve its semiconductor or has to find more sales. Regardless, at the current rate a decision point seems likely on changes for Apple silicon. In the case they want to find more sales, where does Apple expect the sales to come from? Will Apple open M chips to products outside of their lineup? Will Apple restart manufacturing of older chips?,;,; 2023-11-17 11:39:09]

[What percentages of your portfolio are allocated in Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft?,;,; I believe that these companies are too significant to face failure, and their growth will persist in both the short and long term. Additionally, they will gradually acquire additional market share, even venturing into industries such as automotive, as seen with Apple and Google. They will eagerly invest in promising startups, employing any means necessary to eliminate competition and establish dominance.

Both of these companies have tons of IP and know how in the industry. Both have their issues with linear tv and declining revenue due to cost cutting and competition that apple/Amazon can leverage with its services.

[Biden won‚Äôt save the Apple Watch from potential ban,;,; This is bad news for Tim Cook  Apple will continue fighting California-based AliveCor over the startup's electrocardiogram (ECG) technology. On Tuesday, AliveCor announced that US President Joe Biden had decided not to veto the US International Trade Commission's (ITC) December ruling that could lead to an import ban on the Apple Watch Series 4 and later.  It's unlikely that Apple's watch will be totally banned. But as The Verge pointed out, AliveCor could walk away with a licensing agreement from Apple to use its patents in the Apple Watch.  According to AliveCor, which has around 150 workers to Apple's 80,000, it shared its ECG sensor technology with Apple in 2015 while building a business relationship, The Hill reported earlier this month. In 2018, Apple released the Apple Watch Series 4, which not only introduced an ECG sensor to the smartwatch but also blocked outside heart monitoring apps. AliveCor said this forced it in 2019 to stop selling KardiaBand, an ECG band that the company announced for Apple Watches in 2016.  "We come up with new technologies, and instead of the ecosystem letting us thrive and continue to build on top of the innovations we already have, Apple cuts us out up front, steals our technology, uses their platform power to scale it, and now is basically saying it‚Äôs scaled so it can‚Äôt be cut off," AliveCor CEO Priya Abani said, according to The Hill's February 17 report.  In December, the ITC ruled that Apple infringed (PDF) on AliveCor's patent; however, no import ban is currently in effect. That's because AliveCor is currently appealing (PDF) a December ruling by the US Patent and Trademark Office finding that three of the company's patents in question are invalid, as reported by Reuters. As such, an Apple spokesperson told The Verge this week that the ITC's ruling hasn't impacted the Apple Watch yet.  Biden's decision not to veto the ITC's ruling against Apple, reportedly delegated to US Trade Representative Katherine Tai, differs from the last time Apple faced such a ban from the government agency. In 2013, the ITC called for a ban on iPhones and iPads due to Apple infringing on Samsung patents, but then-US President Barack Obama vetoed the ban, following pressure from "phone carriers and a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers," according to The Hill. Before then, no president had vetoed an ITC-issued product ban since 1987, so it was unlikely that Biden would veto December's decision, despite Apple's lobbying efforts reported by The Hill.  With Apple and AliveCor seeking appeals, any mandates regarding the Apple Watch may not take effect for another 18 months, The Hill reported this week.  At the same time, Apple is also battling Masimo over the Apple Watch. In May, the ITC will reveal if there will be an import ban on all Apple Watches except for the SE (from the Series 6 and on) after a January ruling found that Apple infringed on the California and Switzerland-based company's pulse oximeter patent.   2023-02-23 18:23:47]

[Apple opens its first store in India as it looks for a new generation of iPhone users,;,; [  [Apple]( on Tuesday opened its first store in India, highlighting the importance of the market to the iPhone maker‚Äôs future.  The first store, called Apple BKC, is located in the populous city of Mumbai. Apple on Thursday will open another store in the capital of Delhi.  The Cupertino giant said it has been present in India for more than 25 years.  ‚ÄúIndia has such a beautiful culture and an incredible energy, and we‚Äôre excited to build on our long-standing history,‚Äù Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a press release published Monday.  Cook posted a photo of himself and staff at the new apple store on Monday.  Apple is aiming to boost sales and manufacturing of iPhones in India in a move analysts say resembles its strategy when it first entered China, now one of the company‚Äôs biggest markets.  Apple claims its Mumbai store is ‚Äúone of the most energy-efficient‚Äù locations in the world and has a dedicated solar energy system and has zero reliance on fossil fuels for the store‚Äôs operations. Apple BKC runs on 100% renewable energy, Apple said.  Cook has long viewed India as a key market to Apple‚Äôs future and in February he said he was ‚Äúbullish‚Äù on the world‚Äôs fifth-largest economy and the company is putting a ‚Äúsignificant amount of energy‚Äù into the market. Cook traveled to India for the opening of the store, [nearly seven years after his first visit as Apple CEO](  India‚Äôs smartphone market, however, has been dominated in recent years by Samsung and Chinese brands such as [Xiaomi]( with low-to-mid-tier priced devices finding support from customers in a price-sensitive market. Apple has very little market share in India.  But India is undergoing a ‚Äúpremiumification of market,‚Äù according to Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research. Smartphones priced above $400 now account for 10% of the total volumes of handsets shipped versus 4% before the pandemic, according to Shah. He said this category of smartphones accounts for 35% of total smartphone market revenue.  ‚ÄúApple as usual has got the timing right on ‚Äòpeaking at the right time‚Äô with its flagship store strategy to catalyse this trend in its favour,‚Äù Shah told CNBC via email.  India has a growing middle class, a young and ‚Äúmobile first‚Äù population willing to pay more for phones, especially in Mumbai and Delhi, two of the country‚Äôs wealthiest cities and the location of the new Apple stores.  ## iPhone sales in focus  Apple‚Äôs India push offers the opportunity for the U.S. technology giant to boost revenue and iPhone sales near the levels seen in markets like the U.S. and China, analysts said.  Apple shipped about 6.5 million iPhones in India in 2022, compared to around 50 million each year in both the U.S. and China, according to Counterpoint Research. Shah said India ‚Äúhas the potential to reach that scale‚Äù in the coming years.  Shipments refer to the iPhones Apple sends to retailers but do not equal sales. However, it is an indicator of the demand for iPhones in a country.  Apple made $6 billion in revenue in the year through to March, growing 50%, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter.  Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said that could rise further over the next two years.  ‚ÄúApple is now aggressively looking at India from both a production and retail expansion over the coming years that we believe will be a strategic poker move for Cupertino that could ramp annual revenue to $20 billion by 2025 in India,‚Äù Ives said in a note published Tuesday.  But it‚Äôs not just about selling iPhones. Apple‚Äôs strategy over the years has involved getting users locked into its suite of products including the Apple Watch and services like Apple Music.  ‚ÄúApple can cross sell other products such as Macs, Watch, AirPods, iPads and services to the growing iPhone user base maximising the revenue opportunity,‚Äù Shah said.  ## Manufacturing push  For Apple, India also represents a key part of its manufacturing strategy for the future.  Apple¬†[began assembling its flagship iPhone 14 in India](¬†last year ‚Äî the first time that the company has produced its latest device in the country, so close to its initial launch. Piyush Goyal, India‚Äôs minister of commerce and industry,¬†said in January that Apple is aiming to make 25% of all of its iPhones in India.  Part of the move in India is tied to the government‚Äôs push to bring high-tech manufacturing to the country. But Apple is also trying to diversify its assembly of products away from China. Supply chain fragilities in the world‚Äôs second-largest economy were exposed during the Covid pandemic and the strict measures Beijing took to control the outbreak.  [Production was disrupted](¬†last year at Apple‚Äôs biggest iPhone factory, located in Zhengzhou, China, by a [Covid outbreak](¬†and¬†[worker protests]( That factory is run by the Taiwanese firm Foxconn.  Wedbush‚Äôs Ives said Apple‚Äôs India strategy ‚Äî with both a retail and manufacturing push ‚Äî mirrors the technology giant‚Äôs steps it took in the China market 10 years ago.  ‚ÄúAs Foxconn/Apple put more skin in the game on the iPhone production front within India this will go hand in hand with a bigger retail presence within India as seen this week which mirrors the early days of the China penetration strategy going back a decade,‚Äù Iva said.  ‚ÄúRome was not built overnight and neither will Apple‚Äôs broader India strategy, however, we view this week as Apple diving into the deep end of the pool in India as this massive market slowly converts into the Apple ecosystem over the coming years with iPhone market share gains front and center.‚Äù,;,; 2023-04-18 14:24:41]
[Can Apple Be the Next Big AI Stock?,;,; [  Apple is doubling down on its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities with significant investments in multiple specialized AI teams. Led by John Giannandrea, the company's Head of AI, these units aim to develop advanced models to compete with leading AI technologies by OpenAI and Google. The "Foundational Models" team, with about 16 members, is working to enhance Siri and explore AI language models. Other teams focus on visual intelligence and multimodal AI, covering image, video, and text generation. One application under development is an AppleCare chatbot. Apple's internal language model, known as Ajax GPT, is touted to surpass OpenAI's GPT-3.5, having been trained on over 200 billion parameters. CEO Tim Cook emphasizes that Apple's primary aim is not to be first, but to be the best, aligning with his business philosophy.        However, Apple faces challenges as rumors circulate that China has banned government officials from using iPhones, affecting the company‚Äôs stock prices. China is a critical market and manufacturing hub for Apple, contributing nearly one-fifth of its revenue.

[India could account for 20% of Apple‚Äôs user growth over the next five years,;,; India will likely be a major driver of Apple‚Äôs five-year revenue and installed base growth, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note Monday, citing Apple‚Äôs investment in manufacturing in India and the country‚Äôs ‚Äúeconomic boom.‚Äù  The note also reflected a new India-driven price target increase, from $190 to $220, with a bull-case valuation increased to $270. Morgan Stanley also reiterated Apple as their Top Pick.  Morgan Stanley analysts forecast that over the next five years, the country could account for 15% of Apple‚Äôs revenue growth ‚Äî in contrast to 2% in the past five years and $6 billion today ‚Äî and 20% of the company‚Äôs installed base growth.  The revenue growth, which Morgan Stanley forecasts at $40 billion over the next 10 years, would be the ‚Äúequivalent to Apple ramping an entirely new product category.‚Äù  The analysts cite a number of factors in their assessment, including India‚Äôs improved electrification and Apple‚Äôs clear efforts to build a manufacturing and retail presence in the country. A survey commissioned by Morgan Stanley suggested Indian consumers have an increased desire and ability to purchase iPhones.  Analysts did add a caveat, warning that if India fails to meet its economic and demographic growth marks, ‚Äúwe wouldn‚Äôt expect Apple to be as significant of a beneficiary in India.‚Äù  But Morgan Stanley‚Äôs fundamental thesis is bullish. ‚ÄúAll-in, this means that India will be just as important to Apple‚Äôs growth algorithm over the next 5+ years as China was in the last 5 years, something we believe the market underappreciates today,‚Äù the analysts said.   2023-07-17 12:59:06]
[Question regarding successful companies such as Microsoft apple Amazon etc,;,; So I'm new to investing and right now plan on holding very long term. Just opened a roth account and researching career opportunities to make more to funnel into stocks actually max out my roth annually right now I don't make enough which kinda socks.  Anyways my question can these companies grow their share prices when they already maximized their markets I mean how much more money can they make per year? I feel like it's a matter of holding on to key business to not lose to a competitor but as far as growth there is no more. So would that equate to the share prices hovering or slightly increasing? Like in the 90s apple had a small market with their desktops then in the early 2000s started ipods laptops then the iPhone there was so much of a market to expand upon and so much money to be made. Now everyone has an iPhone and MacBook its about keeping that consumer trend going.   So if I want to make the most out of investments I need to find companies that are like apple in early 2000s. Or can I put money in these giant companies and still see a lot of growth? Also I understand they do stock splits to offer more and keep shares down so will that continually happen making great returns possible?,;,; 2023-12-14 05:31:21]

[Nasdaq 100 Plans Special Rebalance To Curb Dominance Of 'Magnificent Seven' (apple, meta, google, Microsoft, Tesla..),;,; From     The Nasdaq 100 index is set to adjust the weighting of its 100 components, with the "magnificent seven" stocks Microsoft (MSFT), Apple, Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon.com (AMZN) currently accounting for more than half the index's weight.  The magnificent seven stocks largely fell Monday.  The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will take place before the market open on Monday, July 24, to "address overconcentration in the index by redistributing the weights."  The weighting changes will be announced on Friday, July 14. No stocks will be added or removed.  The Nasdaq 100 includes the 100 largest non-financial Nasdaq components.   How Is the Nasdaq 100 Weighted? The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.  The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.  The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.  Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.  Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.  Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.  Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.  Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.  How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut? Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.  Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.  The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.  Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023 The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.  This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.  There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.  Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices? The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.  However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&amp;P 500, which is why S&amp;P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.  The S&amp;P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.  Most of the "magnificent 7" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.  The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.  Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.,;,; 2023-07-10 20:25:37]
[iPhone sales slow down: Apple to see sharpest fall in revenue since 2016 as analysts stress on AI to boost growth,;,; Apple is expected to witness a decline in iPhone sales during the April-June quarter, attributed to cautious consumer behaviour in a slow economy as the launch of a new model is anticipated. As the tech giant prepares to release its earnings report, analysts emphasise the significance of revealing its utilisation of artificial intelligence (AI) to boost growth.  Apple, the world's most valuable company, is projected to experience a 1.6% dip in total quarterly revenue, which would mark its sharpest decrease in third-quarter revenue since 2016, according to Refinitiv. Specifically, iPhone sales are anticipated to have declined by over 2% during this period, based on a survey of 24 analysts conducted by Visible Alpha. This contrasts with a nearly 3% increase in sales during the same quarter last year and a 1.5% rise in the preceding quarter (January-March).  The upcoming quarterly report may serve as a deviation from the positive earnings trend observed in other prominent tech companies such as Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Microsoft. These companies have demonstrated resilience in their cloud-based operations and have witnessed a surge in digital ad sales. "Apple is not immune to general macroeconomic trends and will continue to set the pace (for the smartphone industry) for quite some time," Reuters quoted Bob O'Donnell, founder of TECHnalysis Research, as saying. In September, analysts anticipate the unveiling of the much-anticipated iPhone 15, which could feature the widely accepted USB-C port on certain models. This development may provide a slight boost to iPhone sales during the July-September quarter, according to market experts, who have differing opinions on the overall performance during this period.  Notably, Apple has a tradition of not providing quarterly outlooks. However, industry analysts speculate that the tech giant might shed light on its utilisation of AI to enhance the upcoming product lineup, offering insights into the company's innovative approach.,;,; 2023-08-02 01:27:57]

[Inside Apple‚Äôs Spectacular Failure to Build a Key Part for Its New iPhones,;,; Apple had planned to have its modem chip ready to use in the new iPhone models.

Apple‚Äîwhich hasn‚Äôt publicly acknowledged its modem project, much less its shortcomings‚Äîis estimated to have **paid more than $7.2 billion to Qualcomm last year for the chips.**   Engineering teams working on Apple‚Äôs modem chip have been slowed by **technical challenges, poor communication and managers split** over the wisdom of trying to design the chips rather than buy them, these people said. Teams were siloed in separate groups across the U.S. and abroad without a global leader.

[Shareholders Adore Apple! Value Exceeds $3T,;,; The value of Apple is starting to rise towards the historic record of $3 trillion, which it has already surpassed once in history. This is likely happening in connection with the recent WWDC 2023, where promising products such as Vision Pro were introduced. However, the hot news of this AR/VR headset is not what drives up the company's stock price. Mark Gurman offers a different explanation.     **Why Are Investors Not Showing Interest In Vision Pro?**   [**Apple**]( touched the $3 trillion mark at the beginning of 2022. Now it is approaching it again, and ***Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman***, who has long focused on [Apple‚Äôs business strategy]( provides an analysis that reveals the reasons behind this trend. At first glance, it may seem that investors believe in the revolutionary Vision Pro headset, but the opposite is true.   AR/VR glasses like Vision Pro will not become as popular as iPhones or MacBooks when they are launched. The high price, impractical external battery, and the still unclear practical use of this headset will be the cause. Apple is aware of this, as are the investors who rely on other products.  **What Drives The Increase In Stock Prices?**   As the first reason, Gurman mentions Apple‚Äôs user interface. The integration of all mobile devices, tablets, watches, and the availability of music and video subscriptions on every product is extremely convenient, making it hard to leave this ecosystem. In the case of Apple, customers are simply willing to pay extra for the luxury that the brand offers.   Another aspect is the fact that a new series of iPhones, the [**iPhone 15**]( will be released in the fall, bringing more significant changes and new features after a while.

I expect growth from its cloud services, YouTube, and maybe some of Google bets might play out (Pixel phones, robotaxies, chromebooks if they stop sucking...) , but we all know that the most profitable part of Google business is its search engine.  Know, while Microsoft might try to eat Googles pie and is probably its main competitor over most segments, especially Bing/Chatgpt vs Chrome/Bard, Outlook vs Gmail, M.Teams vs G.meet and so on, I think the biggest treat is actually Apple.  Right know Google is paying a big undisclosed amount (probably around 20 bln $ a year ) to be the default search engine on Apple devices, where a lot of Google searches (from the most valuable well off users) come from. The idea that Apple could raise the price of the deal by a lot or start promoting its own search engine is quite terrifing. It would be a risky move for them (losing 10s of blns a year for doing effectively nothing, and coming up with a search engine on their own that gives satisfactory results) but given Apples pivot toward services and its insane customer loyalty it might not be that crazy after all.  Android has a biggest market share, but these people have a lower capacity/willingness to spend, so it doesn't really matters that much. If I had to rate Google search traffic, I would say that the one coming from Android users is the safest (and probably the least profitable), the one coming from Windows PC is still relatively safe (despite bing being default and intagrated with Chatgpt), and the one coming from iOS is the one most at risk, and unfortunately for Google the most profitable.  This article summarizes some of my concerns quite well.  An article I just read put it quite well IMO   [     Let me know what you think.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-07-12 10:56:53]

[Apple, Nvidia, Intel, and Others Interested in Arm‚Äôs Upcoming Blockbuster IPO,;,; [  September initial public offering (IPO) on the Nasdaq, after receiving approvals from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Nasdaq. The anticipated $60 billion valuation will make it the largest IPO of 2023. Leading tech giants such as Nvidia, Intel, Samsung, and Apple are keen to acquire a few percent stake each in Arm, aiming for medium to long-term shareholder roles to ensure stock price stability at listing.        Since the abandonment of a $40 billion sale to Nvidia in 2020 due to regulatory concerns, SoftBank has been working on taking Arm public. The chipmaker's market valuation has doubled from the $31 billion SoftBank paid seven years ago. This significant IPO follows Technicolor's $97 billion deal in September 2022, marking a major milestone in the technology and finance sectors.        Arm's IPO stands as a pivotal event in the global semiconductor market, reflecting the company's critical role in the industry. Along with the imminent listing, other major financial moves are underway in the tech world, such as Alibaba's contemplation of a $29 billion listing of its IDCG e-commerce unit in the US, showcasing a dynamic and robust market landscape.,;,; 2023-08-08 13:37:44]
[Apple's mixed reality headset announcement sends Unity stock soaring,;,; Unity Software (U) stock soared on Monday, rising nearly 20% into the close after a shoutout during Apple's (AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference.        Unity's gaming software will be used in Apple's new mixed reality headset, the Apple Vision Pro, Apple announced on Monday.  "We know there is a community of developers who have been building incredible 3D apps for years," Apple's vice president of worldwide developer relations said during the WWDC presentation. And today we are excited to share that we've been working with Unity to bring those apps to Vision Pro. So popular Unity-based games and apps can gain full access to vision OS features such as pass-through, high-resolution renderings, and native gestures."        **Volume in Unity stock shot up to more than triple the 20-day moving average as the stock had its best intraday performance since November 10.**  Unity operates a cross-platform game engine that was first discussed at an Apple WWDC in 2005 in regard to the Mac. The company went public in 2020 and the stock was bought up to nearly $200 a share during the 2021 tech surge in stocks. Ark Innovation Founder Cathie Wood is a shareholder. Unity is the 15th largest holding in Ark's flagship fund, the Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) and represents 3.46% of the total portfolio.       On May 10, Unity reported first-quarter earnings that beat Street estimates for revenue while posting a wider-than-expected loss per share. **Unity reported first-quarter revenue of $500.36 million compared to Wall Street estimates of $477.67**. Unity's adjusted earnings per share loss of $0.09 was more than $0.01 the Street had been expecting.        Like others in the gaming sector, Unity spent its first-quarter earnings call positioning itself as an AI winner.        "AI is going to have a profound effect on the industry," Unity CEO John S. Riccitiello said on the company's earnings call. "First, it's going to lead to inflection up in growth as game types are built that were no longer ‚Äî were not previously possible. And secondly, we're going to see, I believe, some of the crazy expense that goes on in some high-end production come down some. It's a favorable part of the game industry for growth. And I guess it'd be very favorable for Unity as we drive some of these changes through the industry.",;,; 2023-06-06 10:48:35]

[AAPL stock continues climb to $3T with new trading highs,;,; Apple stock (AAPL) recently bucked a year-long trend and set a new record-high closing price. Ten days later, investors are looking at a new intraday trading high as well as the highest closing price to date.        The company closed at $187.00 per share today after opening at $183.74 and reaching $187.04 during trading. That puts Apple at a $2.941 trillion valuation based on market cap.        Apple nearly became the first company to close with a $3 trillion company valuation in January 2022, but the peak high didn‚Äôt last through intraday trading. Apple would go on to lose $1 trillion in value by year‚Äôs end due to iPhone supply constraints bottlenecking sales.        And while Apple stock saw the company‚Äôs valuation hit the $3 trillion mark last year, AAPL still hasn‚Äôt closed with a $3 trillion company valuation.        Despite significant setbacks at the end of last year, it continues to look likely that Apple will close with a $3 trillion valuation in the near future. Apple is once again positioned as the most valuable company on Wall Street, with a $2.94 trillion valuation.        In terms of products, Apple is planning four new iPhones with USB-C this fall. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are gaining the Dynamic Island design introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro. 9to5Mac also has in-depth reporting on the new iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. The latter iPhone is expected to be the first with a periscope-design lens system for enhanced optical zoom.

[China plans to expand its ban on iPhones, AAPL drops 3%+,;,; **China plans to expand a ban on the use of iPhones in sensitive departments** to government-backed agencies and state companies, a sign of growing challenges for Apple Inc. in its biggest foreign market and global production base.  Several agencies have begun instructing staff not to bring their iPhones to work, people familiar with the matter said, affirming a previous report from the Wall Street Journal. In addition, **Beijing intends to extend that restriction far more broadly to a plethora of state-owned enterprises and other government-controlled organizations**, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter.  If Beijing goes ahead, **the unprecedented blockade will be the culmination of a yearslong effort to root out foreign technology use** in sensitive environments, coinciding with Beijing‚Äôs effort to reduce its reliance on American software and circuitry. It **threatens to erode Apple‚Äôs position in a market that yields about a fifth of its revenue**, and from where it makes the majority of the world‚Äôs iPhones through sprawling factories that employ millions of Chinese.

[Epic Games wins antitrust lawsuit against Google,;,;  SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî Epic Games won an antitrust lawsuit against Google on Monday, in a landmark decision where a jury found Google broke competition laws in how it ran its app store.  The decision is a major blow to the tech giant and the concept that Big Tech companies should have complete control over how pricing and payments are done on their massive internet platforms. It could open up other challenges to how large tech companies govern their marketplaces, potentially forcing them to allow alternate payment processors. That could cut into revenue for Google and other companies like Apple and Amazon, which make money by charging fees on any transactions on their platforms.  In summer 2020, Epic had revolted against Apple and Google‚Äôs payment-sharing systems for app developers. Epic tweaked its popular Fortnite app so users could pay the company directly. First Apple, then Google, booted Fortnite from their app stores for violating terms. Epic sued both companies, arguing the rules violated the Sherman Antitrust Act.   2023-12-12 01:13:50]
[Apple to Make Small Number of Job Cuts in Some Corporate Retail Teams,;,; Apple Inc. is eliminating a small number of roles within its corporate retail teams, according to people with knowledge of the matter, marking its first known internal job cuts since it embarked on a belt-tightening effort last year.   The company is shedding positions in what it calls its development and preservation teams, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the move hasn‚Äôt been announced. Those groups are responsible for the construction and upkeep of Apple retail stores and other facilities around the world.  While the number of positions being eliminated couldn‚Äôt be ascertained and is likely very small, the move represents a new step for the world‚Äôs most valuable company, whose peers have been slashing their ranks in the face of a shaky economy and sluggish consumer spending.  Apple is positioning the move as a streamlining effort, rather than layoffs. It told employees that the changes were designed to improve upkeep of stores globally and that the company will provide support to affected workers.   The iPhone maker has largely held off on corporate layoffs, even as it trims budgets and pares back much of its contractor workforce, including on-contract engineers, recruiters and security guards. The company previously cut corporate jobs before the pandemic, when it eliminated a couple hundred members of its self-driving car division.  With the latest move, Apple told employees in those groups that they would have the ability to reapply for a number of roles similar to their prior jobs. Those who don‚Äôt take a new role will get as much as four months of pay, the people said.  A representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.  Apple‚Äôs Workforce Has Grown Steadily Over the Past Decade  The company avoided the hiring surge of some peers during the pandemic  Sources: Company reports, Bloomberg Some management roles are also being eliminated. While those employees could be rehired as so-called individual contributors, they may not have the same compensation, according to the people. In a few instances, some employees are exempt and will keep their jobs without needing to reapply.   Apple had 164,000 employees as of September, when its last fiscal year ended. The company didn‚Äôt expand its workforce as quickly as many big tech companies during the pandemic, decreasing the need for major layoffs. Its peers, including Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs Google, have cut tens of thousands of jobs.  Share,;,; 2023-04-03 22:27:18]

[How does Tesla go up 7% after all the news about Elon Musk‚Äôs autopilot incident?,;,; I guess I need to add this: I do **not** own any stocks or shorts or puts or whatever related to Tesla, because the way that Tesla works in the market confuses me. I just want to learn.   Everybody also thinks this is an attack on Tesla and Musk. It is **not**. I want to know if this is the way that the market works or not.  Why do I care? Because Tesla is relatively a gigantic company. Why did I ask about if the same would happen with Apple? Because Apple is also a relatively gigantic company.   I thought you were allowed to ask about stocks on this sub.   ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  On Friday August 25th, [Elon Musk posted a video on X]( that now has 44 million views, of him driving a Tesla on autopilot. In the video he has to brake the car himself when it almost runs a red light (at around 19:45). It also received a decent amount of news coverage.   This appears to have not affected the stock‚Äôs value at all and as of the closing today (August 29th) the stock is up over 7%  I‚Äôd expect such an incident to have negative effects on a company‚Äôs value, but this didn‚Äôt.   Are these sorts of things usually just not big deals?   If Apple were demonstrating their new iPhone‚Äôs amazing app that works perfectly and then it caused the phone to crash, would that negatively affect the value?  Or is it basically all just about the money that the company brings in?  ‚Äî‚Äî   Thanks to everybody who answered nicely. I‚Äôve gotten some explanations that make sense including:  - Elon‚Äôs livestream video wasn‚Äôt of current autopilot software on Teslas, but rather a beta FSD which performed very well.  - 44 million people probably didn‚Äôt actually see that moment where ‚Äúhuman intervention‚Äù takes place. Plus the media blew it out of proportion.  - Computer trading algorithms don‚Äôt care about these minute things.  - This isn‚Äôt exclusive to Tesla. Similar things like this happening to other gigantic companies happen and they barely matter.  - The market overall went up on the 29th and Tesla has a high beta.

[Apple stock could soar 37% to a $4 trillion market valuation by the end of 2024 after confirming a key breakout to all-time highs,;,; * Apple stock could see big upside ahead after it confirmed its breakout above the prior record high of $183, according to Fairlead Strategies. * Shares could jump 37% from current levels to $254 by the end of 2024. * "The uptrend \[in Apple\] shows no counter-trend signals yet," Fairlead Strategies said.  Apple stock decisively confirmed its breakout to new record highs on Friday, and that could pave the way for more upside into 2024, according to a Friday note from Fairlead Strategies.  The firm highlighted that with Apple stock trading at $187 Friday afternoon, the stock is poised to close above its prior resistance level of $183 for the second week in a row, confirming a decisive breakout.  This "bullish long-term development" generates a new price objective of $254 per share for Apple, representing potential upside of 37% from current levels. A rise to that level would give the iPhone maker a market valuation of about $4 trillion based on today's current shares outstanding of 15.79 billion.  "The breakout yields a measured move objective of about $254 using the Covid/2020 corrective low as a point of reference," Fairlead Strategies' founder Katie Stockton told Insider on Friday. "The 'measured move' assumes that the uptrend that preceded the 2021-2022 trading range has resumed."  Stockton identified the end of 2024 as the timeframe for the technical price objective to be reached, and noted that the stock's uptrend looks poised to continue in the short term.  "The uptrend shows no counter-trend signals yet. When a pullback develops, initial support is at the rising 20-day moving average... although a pullback does not appear imminent," she said. The 20-day moving average for Apple stock is currently around $181 per share.  Apple stock has surged 44% so far in 2023 and has driven the bulk of the S&amp;P 500's year-to-date gain of about 14%. The company recently announced its first product in the AR/VR market, the Apple Vision headset, which will sell for $3,499 when it is released early next year.  Apple's current valuation is about $2.96 trillion, and it's set to cross the $3 trillion threshold if the stock price hits $190.73, which is just over $3 away from current levels.

[It's hard to beat the market. Ok, but what is "the market"?,;,; Common advice you get everywhere: "Don't try to beat the market, just invest in X". The irony is that X always seems to be something else.  In this sub, it's usually the S&amp;P500. But this sub is mostly used by people from the US. If you visit a European investing sub and tell them you are "100% in SPY", they will tell you that's it's hard to beat the market and that's it's better to invest in the MSCI World.

[Movie theater stocks pop after report says Apple plans to spend $1B on releases,;,;   Cinema stocks jumped Thursday after a report said Apple plans to spend $1 billion a year on theatrical film releases.  The investment is part of the tech company‚Äôs efforts to raise its profile in Hollywood and lure subscribers to its streaming service, Apple TV+, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  Typically, Apple has released films directly to its streaming platform or allowed limited runs in a small number of theaters for Academy Award eligibility. Apple recently won best picture for its film ‚ÄúCODA.‚Äù  The commitment to longer theatrical releases is a way for the company to appease talent, who want their projects on the big screen, and drum up awareness for its streaming platform, which is estimated to have between 20 million and 40 million users, much smaller than rivals Netflix and Disney+.  Cinemark jumped as much as 10% on the news, while IMAX and AMC rose about 4% and 5%, respectively. They gave up some of their gains later Thursday.  Apple didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment.  Amazon made a similar commitment last November, promising to make between 12 and 15 movies for movie theaters each year.  Bloomberg‚Äôs report indicated that Martin Scorsese‚Äôs crime thriller ‚ÄúKillers of the Flower Moon,‚Äù Matthew Vaughn‚Äôs spy movie ‚ÄúArgylle‚Äù and Ridley Scott‚Äôs historical epic ‚ÄúNapoleon‚Äù are on the short list for these longer theatrical runs. No plans have been finalized, but these releases could remain in cinemas for at least a month. Last year, Apple TV+ became the first streaming service to win the Academy Award for best picture, with ‚ÄúCoda.‚Äù  In the wake of the pandemic, distributors shortened the theatrical release window to 45 days from from around 90 days. Some studios have deals with cinema chains that allow for shorter runs based on ticket sales. Then there are others, like Paramount and Skydance‚Äôs ‚ÄúTop Gun: Maverick,‚Äù which remained in theaters long after the 45-day time period.  Already, 2023 is expected to be a stronger year at the domestic box office, as production levels returned to normal in 2022, but word of Apple‚Äôs additional film commitments gives the industry another confidence boost.,;,; 2023-03-23 18:38:57]
[In 5 Years, Who do You Think Comes out on Top in the AI wars?,;,; Microsoft?  Amazon?  Google?  Apple?  Even maybe Palantir?  Nvidia?  Or more than 1 of them?   I think Microsoft is currently the best positioned with it's larger market share with Azure right now,  but Amazon is catching up with Lex and all of the AWS products.  Google seems way behind both companies.   Microsoft (at least right now) is also the most logically and fairly valued P/E wise (unlike say, Nvidia's astronomical PE) and I may dabble with a few grand bc it's cheap.   They also have good cash on hand and good EPS.    Not sure what to make of Apple or PLTR in the AI game, with PLTR some people say their products are the best and most proprietary and others are just "meh" on PLTR and say they are super overvalued.

[Spotify spent more than $1 billion to build a podcasting empire.

It struck splashy deals with Kim Kardashian, the Obamas and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. It paid $286 million for a pair of podcast studios and spent $250,000 and more an episode on exclusive shows to lure new listeners.   The bet hasn‚Äôt paid off.

[Is big tech running into a wall?,;,; One of the interesting things with the huge growth of the FAANG names over the last decade of do is that they have all grown in their own lane.

MSFT is pushing into search with chat GPT, apple is seeing large retailers (Spotify being notable) to incentivize buying through their website as opposed to the app store. Facebook is feeling the pinch of apple's restrictions. Google is moving into the cloud....etc.   I'm thinking these companies will have a hard time keeping up their growth of the last decade because they are starting to have fearsome competition form the first time in ages, from each other.

[AAPL price dump after VR headset reveal,;,; The price movement was directly correlated with the VR headset announcement along with the demo of features.  * Yes, it looks like ski goggles. * The OS is called **Vision Pro** * The VR OS is similar to Microsoft's Mixed Reality with their Hololens product which came out 8 years ago...  One of the **selling features** is that your eyes are visible, but the headset will conceal your eyes when you're fully immersed in an app.. which may or may not be groundbreaking as it didn't perfectly reveal your eyes (perhaps because there wasn't enough lighting inside the goggles to show your eyes clearly, but I think this could be fixed w/ software or by adding LED lights on the inside edges), however:  * If you can keep your headset on while talking to people in the room compared to the competition, this feature alone would win out  Price tag is $3500, but again this is the dev conference, so the consumer version of this product will come later, although I can see how a lot of developers might want to buy this thing (also consider that Apple has the largest developer network) compared to competitor headsets which cost 7x less (META is coming out with a $500 VR headset).  Something to note, the stock dropped nearly 1.5% during all the free features (before the VR headset) that were going to be included to existing users, however that did coincide with the market indexes dropping as well.  Total drop from the peak was around 3.5% however the stock recovered nearly a percent, today's loss is only around 0.75% after falling from making another new 52w all time high.  Trading volume was 2x the normal average, so ending red is very significant.  META &amp; MSFT stayed relatively flat compared to AAPL.  Overall I think this was bad news for the stock in the short term; buy the rumor sell the news type event.  If the VR headset was truly revolutionary, stock price would have gone much higher, **so we have to wait &amp; see what Apple developers can do with this headset for consumers &amp; what Apple's actual consumer version of the headset will be.**  Than after 12 to 18 months when the killer apps come out, re-evaluate Apple's VR headset.

[Nvidia ($NVDA) is the best risk-reward short over the next few months,;,; On a technical-level, $NVDA is absolutely ridiculous. It's valuation is on-par with it's 2021 peak when the GPU shortage was at it's peak, and it's up almost 100% YTD with its inventories ballooning. Of course, trying to short a company just because it's over-valued or overbought is a fool's errand. You'll quickly find out that great stocks can simply keep going up for months on end. That's why you need a spark, or a narrative shift to get the ball rolling for the stock to reverse.    Fundamentally, $NVDA's enormous bounce has been attributed to Chat GPT and the recent AI movement. Just to be clear, I'm bullish on AI. (not $AI lol) However, up until now $NVDA's narrative has been that they will be the biggest, if not the sole, chip benefactor of the AI wave. Their A100 chip is the bread and butter for AI development while their H100 chip is the much beefier, enterprise-focused one. Don't get me wrong, the H100 is quite amazing and it's recent release will be hard to catch for some time. However, up until this point it's been thought that their lead in chips over AMD and Intel would grant them a large revenue boost over the next few years. Google's timely outperformance of the A100 is a testament that challengers are emerging. Nvidia's lead might end sooner than expected.  As we all know, once a technology trend catches on - the big tech players catch on and move quickly while deploying mountains of cash. Whether it's Apple, Microsoft, or Google - they will compete if the TAM is large enough. Whether it's Microsoft squishing out Zoom and Slack, or Apple ousting Intel CPU chips, or Google leveraging YouTube to compete against TikTok - these corporations do not hesitate to compete at any large opportunity.  I think tonight, the narrative has shifted for AI chips. I think we can all agree that big tech truly understands the dramatic paradigm shift that this AI wave will be. AI has been on the backburner for years up until Chat GPT recently proved that it's coming now. Therefore, would it be surprising that these corporations will try to develop their AI-chips in-house? Apple did it for their CPUs in their macs, thanks to TSMC. If Nvidia controlled and manufactured its own fabs then this discussion would be irrelevant. But that's not the case. Google has apparently already caught up to the A100 with their chip designs. What about Apple or Microsoft? You think they're content with continuing to dump fortunes on Nvidia chips if AI is the future? Of course they're going to develop their own chips in house as well. Hardware is key. That's been a turning point for Meta, and is a large reason they're trying to make VR work. You need to control both the hardware and the software.  tl;dr: OTM Puts on $NVDA for May or June 2023. Expect a 20-30% drop in the coming weeks.,;,; 2023-04-05 03:23:15]

[It‚Äôs year 2030, what are the world top 5 largest stocks?,;,; My bets, in no particular order: AMAZON, APPLE, MICROSOFT, BERKSHIRE, and COSTCO.   Amazon's growth is impressive, driven by its expanding e-commerce reach in a market that's still not fully tapped. This juggernaut isn't slowing down anytime soon.  Apple's success lies in its thriving ecosystem, especially its booming services like Apple Music, iCloud or Apple TV. Innovations and strong financials keep it at the forefront, not just maintaining but possibly growing its market presence.  Microsoft stands strong with AI and cloud computing innovations. Its financial resilience and predicted growth in these sectors, along with gaming new bet, make it a likely candidate for continued success.  Berkshire Hathaway's diverse investments by one of the world best capital allocators underpin its steady growth. Their strategic planning and financial acumen, along with discussions on future leadership, suggest a stable and prosperous path ahead.  Costco's growth is powered by its expanding membership and strategic global presence. Their operational efficiency and stable financial performance position them well for the future.

[Arm shares spike 24% after chip designer gives strong forecast, says AI is increasing sales,;,; Arm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat estimates and gave a strong profit forecast for the current quarter. The shares soared more than 20% in extended trading.  Here‚Äôs how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending December:  Revenue: $824 million, vs. $761 million expected  EPS: 29 cents adjusted, vs 25 cents expected.   Arm, whose chip design technology is in nearly every smartphone and many PCs, said it expects earnings per share for the fiscal fourth quarter of between 28 cents and 32 cents on sales of $850 million to $900 million. Analysts expectations earnings of 21 cents per share on sales of $780 million.  The company reported net income of $87 million, or 8 cents per share. Total revenue in the quarter increased 14% from a year earlier.  Arm makes money through royalties, when companies pay for access to build Arm-compatible chips, usually amounting to a small percentage of the final chip price.  Arm said its customers shipped 7.7 billion Arm chips during the September quarter, which is the most recent period which figures are available.  Royalty revenue increased 11% on an annual basis to $470 million. The company said the jump was partially because of a recovery in the smartphone market, as well as increasing sales to automotive companies and cloud providers. Arm said that it expects growth to be driven by royalty revenue.  In recent years, Arm has emphasized its licensing business, selling access to more complete designs that semiconductor companies can take and plug into their planned chips. That process saves chipmakers time and effort, and it‚Äôs more lucrative for Arm than simply collecting royalties.  Arm‚Äôs license and other revenue was $354 million, up 18% year-over-year. Arm said more companies were choosing to license its CPU designs to run artificial intelligence, and that the company charges higher licensing fees for advanced designs.  Arm, which had been owned by SoftBank, went public in September. The company was founded in 1990 to develop technology for low-power chips, but became more important to the overall technology industry when the Apple  iPhone and competing Android devices standardized on Arm-based chips.  Arm says that companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia use its technology.  Source:  2024-02-07 21:43:28]

[It‚Äôs ‚Äòreally the Google web‚Äô: Microsoft CEO testifies about how hard it is to break into search during antitrust trial,;,;   When it comes to online search, it‚Äôs Google‚Äôs web and everyone else is playing in it, according to rival Microsoft. That was the essence of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella‚Äôs testimony in federal court on Monday as part of the government‚Äôs antitrust trial against Google. Nadella told the court that Google‚Äôs dominant market share in online search means that publishers and advertisers shape their content to Google‚Äôs requirements, making it harder for competitors like Microsoft‚Äôs Bing to gain a foothold.  ‚ÄúEverybody talks about the open web, but there is really the Google web,‚Äù Nadella said from the stand in Washington, D.C., District Court. Nadella was referring to the way publishers often cater their content and advertising to Google‚Äôs products, like by optimizing their pages for how Google ranks search results. Nadella was questioned by lawyers for the Department of Justice and a coalition of state attorneys general who are suing Google for allegedly violating antitrust laws by illegally maintaining a monopoly in the general search market. The government argues that Google locked up distribution channels for general search engines through exclusive deals with browser and phone makers to be the default choice on various devices. Perhaps the most famous of those deals is the multibillion-dollar agreement between Google and Apple to make Google search the default on Apple products like the iPhone.  The government has tried to make the case that Google‚Äôs dominance, aided by these exclusive deals, creates a flywheel effect, where greater exposure to users leads to more data to make Google‚Äôs search results better and attracts more advertisers to the product. That, in turn, generates more revenue that can be used to fund these massive distribution deals. Meanwhile, the government argues, it becomes even harder for rivals to breakthrough to consumers, and as a result, they miss out on the opportunity for greater benefits or innovations in search. Nadella affirmed that argument in his testimony Monday, describing the obstacles a general search competitor like Bing faces to gain more market share from Google.,;,; 2023-10-02 23:59:21]

[Nvidia passes Alphabet in market cap, now the third most valuable U.S. company,;,; Nvidia surpassed Google parent Alphabet in market capitalization on Wednesday.

Nvidia rose over 2% to close at $739.00 per share, giving it a market value of $1.83 trillion to Google‚Äôs $1.82 trillion market cap. The move comes one day after Nvidia surpassed Amazon in terms of market value.  The symbolic milestone is more confirmation that Nvidia has become a Wall Street darling on the back of elevated AI chip sales, valued even more highly than some of the large software companies and cloud providers that develop and integrate AI technology into their products.  Nvidia shares are up over 221% over the past 12 months on robust demand for its AI server chips that can cost more than $20,000 each. Companies like Google and Amazon need thousands of them for their cloud services. Before the recent AI boom, Nvidia was best known for consumer graphics processors it sold to PC makers to build gaming computers, a less lucrative market.  Google was largely expected to benefit from AI, especially since employees at the company pioneered many of the techniques ‚Äî such as transformer architecture ‚Äî used in cutting-edge models like ChatGPT.  Google shares are still up 55% in the past 12 months, though the company has grappled with layoffs and culture issues after it declared a ‚Äúcode red‚Äù situation to build AI services into its products. Google announced a $20 per month AI subscription called Gemini Advanced earlier this week, one of its first paid generative AI products.  Nvidia is now the third largest U.S. company, only behind Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia reports quarterly earnings on Feb. 21. Analysts expect 118% annual growth in sales to $59.04 billion.

The subscription service will be available for a fee of $11.99 per month on the web and $14.99 per month on iOS. The higher subscription fee on iOS is likely to offset the 30 percent commission fee levied by Apple on subscriptions.  Meta Verified will be initially rolling out to Australia and New Zealand this week with expansion to more countries shortly.  The social media giant's CEO Mark Zuckerberg has earlier said it was planning to launch several new products that would "empower creators to be way more productive and creative," while cautioning about the cost associated with supporting the technology for a large user base.,;,; 2023-02-19 18:25:31]
[Barrons: Berkshire Hathaway Stock Is Behind the S&amp;P over the past year + 5, 10, &amp; 20 Years,;,; Berkshire Hathaway stock is having a disappointing finish to 2023, putting Warren Buffett‚Äôs conglomerate behind the S&amp;P 500 over the past 10 years.  The Class A shares have lagged behind the S&amp;P 500 by about nine percentage points during the current quarter and now are up about 16% in 2023. That compares with a roughly 26% total return for the index.   The shares are up an annualized 12% in the last 10 years, slightly behind the 12.2% yearly total return, including dividends, for the index. Berkshire also is behind the S&amp;P 500 over the past five years with a 13.4% annualized return, compared with 16.4% for the index., according to Bloomberg calculations.  Berkshire‚Äôs Class A shares were up 0.3% Friday to $542,600 while the Class B stock was 0.1% higher at $356.47.  The stock is roughly even with the index over the past 20 years with a 9.8% annualized return. That is despite dramatic growth in the company‚Äôs operating profits and Buffett‚Äôs coup in buying Apple stock, which is showing a nearly $150 billion gain for Berkshire.   Berkshire stock‚Äôs lagging performance shows how difficult it is for even an investor of Buffett‚Äôs stature to beat an index driven by powerful megacap tech stocks, especially given Berkshire‚Äôs huge size. Its asset base is about $1 trillion.  It isn‚Äôt clear why the stock is lagging behind the market lately. The company is finishing what likely will be a record year for profits. After-tax operating earnings could rise more than 25% to nearly $40 billion in 2023.   Berkshire‚Äôs big property and casualty insurance business is humming as Geico, the auto insurance unit, undergoes a profit turnaround. Berkshire‚Äôs $350 billion equity portfolio is topping the market this year led by Apple, which has gained 55% this year to about $194 a share. Apple accounts for nearly half the portfolio.  The Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, another of Berkshire‚Äôs key businesses, is more valuable this quarter thanks to the rally in shares of its chief rival, Union Pacific could be worth $150 billion, in line with Union Pacific, while all of Berkshire is now valued at about $775 billion.  Berkshire also is benefiting from the sharp rise in short-term interest rates since early 2022. The company is sitting on more than $150 billion in cash that is mostly invested in U.S. Treasury bills yielding above 5%.  It could be that investors anticipate lower earnings on the cash next year, reasoning that the Federal Reserve may well cut short-term rates.  There also could be concern about Buffet‚Äôs age. He turned 93 in August, writing last month that he feels ‚Äúgood‚Äù but saying he is fully aware he is ‚Äúplaying in extra innings.‚Äù The fact that Berkshire could soon lose the leader that built the company over nearly 60 years was highlighted by the recent death of Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger at 99.   Barron‚Äôs recently named Berkshire as a top stock for 2024 based on what looks like a reasonable valuation at 20 times projected 2024 earnings. The company is valued at 1.4 times our estimate of year-end 2023 book value of about $390,000 per class A share.  Buffett may not have many years left at the helm but he seems as sharp and engaged as ever. He could still find the elephant-size acquisition totaling $50 billion or more that he has long sought.  While he said last year that Berkshire has no interest in owning Occidental Petroleum  , Buffett could change his mind. Berkshire continues to add to its stake and now owns about 28% of the energy company. Occidental is valued at more than $50 billion, meaning Berkshire could well snap it up.   2023-12-24 21:18:06]
[Why Is Tesla Prices Not Affected From Recalls?,;,; Hello!   I have started trading for about 6 months and I am always playing safe and trying to understand the trends.    One thing I really find strange is sometimes companies are really affected by the on-going events and sometimes they are not affected at all. I will give a few examples;  1. Tesla stocks have not affected even though they had to recall 2M cars in US.  2. Apple had a significant drop when Chinese government blocked gov. employees using iPhones.   So in my small mind, Tesla has had a much greater problem yet the stock price is unaffected, and apple got significantly hit for a smaller issue.   I would expect Tesla would've been affected in a similar way, but didn't. Is there an explanation?   Thank you in advance!,;,; 2023-12-18 10:45:47]

[Airbnb acquires AI startup for just under $200 million,;,;   * Airbnb has made its first acquisition as a public company, in a deal valued at just under $200 million, sources familiar with the deal told CNBC. * The startup is called Gameplanner.AI, which has been in ‚Äústealth mode‚Äù since its founding in 2020 by Adam Cheyer, one of the founders of Siri, which was acquired by Apple. * Gameplanner.AI will accelerate some of Airbnb‚Äôs AI projects, the source told CNBC.  Airbnb has made its first acquisition as a public company, in a deal valued at just under $200 million, sources familiar with the deal told CNBC.  The startup is called Gameplanner.AI, which has been in ‚Äústealth mode‚Äù since its founding in 2020. Startups in stealth mode operate out of the public eye for various reasons, such as to protect intellectual property or avoid distractions. Gameplanner.AI will accelerate some of Airbnb‚Äôs AI projects, according to Airbnb.  Gameplanner.AI was cofounded by Adam Cheyer, one of the founders of Siri. When Siri was acquired by Apple, he worked alongside Steve Jobs. Cheyer later co-founded Viv Labs, which would become the foundation for Samsung‚Äôs voice assistant.  Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has said that generative AI will radically change the platform and that he wants to use it as a ‚Äútravel concierge‚Äù that learns about users over time and enhances their travel experiences -- for example, matching users with the right rooms or homes.   This deal is Airbnb‚Äôs first acquisition since 2019 and could pique some interest on Wall Street as to whether Chesky‚Äôs M&amp;A strategy is shifting, potentially making Airbnb a more attractive acquisition. The company is profitable on a GAAP basis and held $11 billion in cash and liquid assets as of the end of September.  Airbnb‚Äôs news follows reports that Google is in talks to invest hundreds of millions into another AI startup, Character.AI, which in March raised a $150 million at a $1 billion valuation in a funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz. The startup lets people create virtual characters or chat with AI versions of celebrities like Elon Musk or Albert Einstein.,;,; 2023-11-14 17:53:39]
[Twitter-backer knocks billions off its value after Musk‚Äôs ‚Äògo f--- yourself‚Äô outburst,;,;   &gt;An investor in Twitter has written down the value of its stake by $2.85bn (¬£2.2bn) after Elon Musk told boycotting advertisers to ‚Äúgo f‚Äî yourself‚Äù.  Fidelity, which helped Mr Musk buy the company for $44bn (¬£35bn) in 2022, now believes the company is worth 71.5pc less than at the time of purchase.  The US investment giant had already slashed the value of its investment by 65pc at the end of October but deepened the discount in November. It came in the same month that Twitter‚Äôs billionaire owner launched a tirade against advertisers.  Speaking at a New York Times conference, Mr Musk claimed a boycott by advertisers was going to ‚Äúkill‚Äù the company, adding: ‚ÄúIf somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go f--- yourself.‚Äù  Apple, IBM and Disney are among the major brands to cut ties with the social media platform, amid concerns about lax moderation under Mr Musk and the billionaire‚Äôs freewheeling personal style.  Fidelity‚Äôs valuation cut, which was first reported by Axios, gives the company a notional value of just $12.5bn and suggests Twitter has lost $2.85bn of worth in the eyes of Fidelity in just four weeks.  The investment group, which contributed more than $300m to Mr Musk‚Äôs takeover, does not disclose how it values privately held companies. Other shareholders may value their stakes differently.  However, Twitter‚Äôs own internal stock plan for staff valued the company at just $19bn in October ‚Äì less than half the sum Mr Musk paid for it.,;,; 2024-01-01 23:25:28]

[What incentive does the market have to accurately value companies?,;,; Hi there, I'm very new to investing and I'm still trying to learn the fundamentals. So, this post could sound somewhat uninformed (because it is).  Now, Apple is worth $3T because of the price that its stock is trading at. That's the price that the people interested in buying Apple stock are willing to pay for it because they believe that's how much the company is worth. The same goes for every other asset like houses, gold, paintings, currencies etc. They're worth as much as people value them.  Now, when it comes to houses, I can understand why people value them; they can actually live in them and better houses provide for a greater standard of living. People have an incentive in buying houses other than the fact that their prices will go up. Gold also has aesthetic and scientific value. Paintings have aesthetic value. Currencies enable you to trade with countries that operate in them.  However, I don't fully understand why people value stocks and how buying stocks is different than buying worthless rocks.  What's the market's incentive in trying to get the market value of a company closely resemble its perceived value? Now, if dividends was the only motivation at buying stock - a better company generates higher profits in the long run and gives higher dividends - it would answer my question. However, most companies give very low dividends and high yield savings accounts are often a better choice here.,;,; 2024-01-07 08:47:36]

[A Deep Dive on PayPal: Is it a good time to Buy? [DD],;,; A couple of years ago, PayPal was all the hype. Today, the stock is down 75% from its all-time high. Once a growth stock, PayPal is now moving towards value stock territory. The big question here is this. Is PayPal worth buying right now? Is it a bargain or is it a value trap?  # Operations  First of all, let's look at PayPal's operations. PayPal's main source of revenue are the fees that PayPal charges for completing transactions and other payment-related services. Other revenue sources include foreign currency conversion fees and also fees for purchasing or selling cryptocurrencies. As such, PayPal's business model is based on the volume of transactions. The more transactions, the more fees the company gets. In 2022, users, transactions and payment volume on PayPal increased.   * 2% increase in users to 435 million with 8.6 million new net accounts added   Out of these, 400 million were consumer active accounts and 35 million were active merchant accounts * 16% increase in number of transactions to 22.3 billion * 9% total payment volume increase to $1.36 trillion on a spot basis so basically without adjusting for any forex changes.  The family of PayPal brands includes Braintree, Chargehound, Honey, Venmo and others so the company has a very strong brand presence. I keep seeing an ad for Honey almost every single day, I think the other brands are more US-focused (I'm UK-based), but the gist of it is that PayPal is becoming more popular, more established. [Recently, PayPal added more features to its payment solutions for small businesses.]( The main change was increasing the range of payment options for customers by including Apple Pay along with saving payment options and others.   # Competition  When it comes to mobile payments, PayPal competes with the likes of Google Pay, Cash App, Zelle, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Venmo although Venmo is actually owned by PayPal. They all have some pros and cons. However, PayPal appears to have the best international payment support. PayPal owns Xoom which allows users to send payments to users in 131 countries without the recipient needing an app or a smartphone. The recipient can just pick up the payment at their local bank. PayPal also allows you to send money to people in over 200 countries worldwide as long as they also have the app. PayPal is also ahead of the competition when it comes to web and website payments since you can complete the payment by using any web browser. Doesn't matter if it's Firefox, Chrome or Safari. However, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay can be used with smart watches which are becoming more and more popular.  ***US market***   In fact, this may be one of the reasons why Apple Pay is the most widely used mobile payment service in the US. 43.9 million people report using it at least once followed by Starbucks with 31.2 million. Yes, Starbucks, I know, I'm surprised as well, but it seems to be a popular method of payment in the US. Google Pay follows with 25 million users and Samsung Pay with 16.3 million users. Again, this is in the US.  ***Worldwide***   In terms of total mobile payment users worldwide, you have AliPay and WeChat Pay with 650 and 500 million users respectively, followed by Apple Pay with 507 million, Google Pay with 421 million and PayPal with 377 million. Venmo has 52 million, but it counted separately. If you combine the two since Paypal owns Venmo, Paypal comes ahead of Google Pay with 429 million users. Plus, AliPay and WeChat Pay are pretty much the status quo in China, but they are not that big outside of China. In fact, I'm not sure you can get them outside of China unless you are a Chinese national. Essentially, Google Pay, Apple Pay and Paypal are the big international names. Now, Google and Apple have a big advantage because they obviously produce their own phones, they have iOS and Android and they pretty much come with built-in Apple and Google Pay. They also have the smart watches which integrate with these payment apps.   ***Total Payment Volume competition***   Now, it would be really good if we could see the official total payment volume through these apps and compare it with Paypal. It could be the case where because the payment apps are installed by default, it seems they have a large userbase, but in reality users don't use them as much as Paypal or they just use them for small purchases. [The closest stats I could find were in this article here]( The author claims that Apple Pay has a total transaction volume of $6 trillion whereas Google Pay had $2.5 trillion. However, these are not official statistics by either of these companies. There are also disagreements over what exactly constitutes an Apple Pay or Google Pay transaction. In most cases, people don't pay with the apps, they just use the wallet option to pay with their actual card instead of paying with the digital payment app. Again, we don't know the exact transaction volume and we can just speculate, but we can see why Apple and Google Pay are massive competitors to Paypal. Still, the good thing is that the market for mobile payment apps is growing fast worldwide. There are a lot more users left to capture and Paypal is in a good position to do that as one of the leading payment apps, but enough about operations.  # Financials metrics  We know Paypal is big and we know it's not going anywhere. The company is a viable competitor to Google and Apple, but what are the financials of Paypal? Are they profitable? Are they efficient? What's the case here?  To answer these questions, I will look at Paypal's current and historical metrics and compare them to the company's peers in the Transaction and Payment Processing sector in the US. Quick note on the sector metrics. This sector is dominated by Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Fiserv, Block and Fidelity National Information Services. These 6 companies make up 77% of the total revenue in this sector. Meanwhile, 18 of the 35 companies in the sector are losing money. Basically, take the sector data with some hint of salt. I want to provide some comparison for Paypal, but at the same time we have a duopoly of Visa and Mastercard at the top and a lot of new players at the bottom.  Okay, so lets look at profitability. Paypal has a:  * gross profit margin of 42.35% which is below its 5-year average of 45.79% and the sector median of 47.32% * net income margin of 8.79% is also below its 5-year average of 14.58%, but above the sector median of 0.57% * levered free cash flow margin stands at 12.1% compared to its 5-year average of 14.58% and the sector median of 4.73% * Return on Equity is decent at 11.5% compared to the 5-year average of 16.7% and the sector median of 11.05%  Overall, Paypal is doing well. Their metrics have declined over the last few years which is worrying, but the change has not been that drastic \[yet\]. It's good to monitor these metrics of course because this could turn into a red flag if the trend continues.  # Analyst Expectations  Despite the above, analysts are expecting a steady growth in earnings per share over the next few years. The consensus is:  * 18.33% in 2023 * 15.28% in 2024 * 13.07% in 2025  In fact, analysts have recently started revising their expectations up which is a good sign. Basically, the sentiment towards Paypal is improving after a year and a half of declining expectations. This type of expectations change often leads to a reversal in stock price so this is one reason why I am turning bullish on Paypal.  Paypal has historically shown really good growth in revenue and earnings. Their compounded annual revenue growth is 17% since 2013 with their revenue going from $6,727 billion in 2013 to $27,518 billion in 2022. Their compounded annual earnings growth is 10.9% with earnings growing from $955 million in 2013 to $2.42 billion in 2022. By the looks of it, this type of growth can be sustained for at least another few years.  # Valuation  This is really, really good, mainly because the stock has lately been priced as a value stock. Paypal has:  * adjusted PE ratio of 18.15 compared to the 5-year average of 41.72. * adjusted forward PE ratio of 15.34 compared to the 5-year average of 37.94 * price-to-earnings growth ratio of only 1.1 compared to the 5-year average of 2 * relatively low forward price-to-book of 3.74 compared to the 5-year average of 8.1 * forward price-to-cash-flow of 11.84 compared to their 5-year average of 27.4  The way I see it, there are 2 reasons for the low valuation.  One, Paypal had a massively inflated stock price in 2021. Typically, you see a corresponding massive drop in price after this type of jump in valuation. Overreaction in one direction leads to overreaction in the opposite direction, a bit like a pendulum. This creates an amazing buying opportunity and I think we are seeing this right now.  The second reason for the low valuation could be that investors have different expectations to analysts. Even though the analysts expect a steady growth in earnings and profits, maybe investors don't see it that that way. Maybe there are some risk factors that analysts are overlooking. That's valid. Looking at Paypal's annual report, we can see a lot of factors that the company identifies. Cybersecurity is a crucial one, increasing competition is another. You also have legislation and compliance risk, you have risk to do with credit, third parties and so on. A lot of these are just regular day-to-day business threats that a financial processing company faces.  The main risk in my eyes is the increasing competition from Google and Apple. However, Paypal has some advantage there because it is mainly a financial company. Google and Apple have other more important business units and I think that Google Pay and Apple Pay are not as important to these companies as their core businesses. In comparison, payments and transactions are Paypal's core business. Cryptocurrency is also a growing risk, but I don't think it poses that big of a threat to Paypal right now. Maybe in 5 years or so. However, Paypal has been active in allowing users to buy, sell and transfer cryptocurrencies. Plus, users can actually use Paypal to pay in crypto although there are improvements that can be made there.  # Conclusion  Overall, I think that **we currently have a good bullish argument for Paypal**. The valuation is really cheap. We are seeing some of the lowest prices since December 2018. Even the company itself has committed to buying back a lot of shares because of the cheap price. In 2022, Paypal bought back $4.2 billion worth of shares or about 80% of their free cash flow. The management has said that they think share buybacks are an excellent way to spend their capital and I agree. They estimate that 75% of the free cash flow in 2023 will go towards share repurchases. In my opinion, this will create bullish pressure for the company. It will reduce the floating stock, it will increase ownership for existing shareholders and it will boost metrics. In terms of target price, the analyst consensus right now is $103.4 dollars or about a 38% upside on the current price of $75. I think that's a reasonable target for the next 12 to 18 months.  What do you think? Is Paypal a good purchase right now? Have I missed any important details about their business?,;,; 2023-04-10 10:43:24]

Is it just because a company is considered a software or internet related, then the stock is considered a growth stock? I don't get it. Amazon or Google are giant multinationals than will now grow as much as some AI or gaming startup, IMO they should be paying dividends to their shareholders, or are we past that line of thinking now?,;,; 2023-10-27 13:42:50]
[Best growth oriented mid and small cap stocks?,;,; Anyone have thoughts on Olin, Zscaler or Welltower? Looking to reallocate about 20% of my portfolio that is currently invested in APPL. Would also love to hear any picks for small or mid cap companies with really good growth potential as the bulk of my portfolio is pretty balanced. The assets I have in Apple are earmarked for a more risky, higher growth allocation. Since i'm sure people would think i'm crazy to sell APPL, I have a rule not to invest in any companies working on or involved in accelerating the push for generative AI(MSFT, GOOG, META, NVDA). And yes it sucks watching those stocks skyrocket. Luckily I get my entertainment from watching my long term TSLA position and recent RIVN shares fluctuate wildly.

[Review my AAPL stock prediction from 2022,;,; Was I right in 2022? AAPL just touched a record $184.95. I argued that AAPL's changes that came during the pandemic would prevent it from collapsing back to pre-pandemic price points like most other stocks.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  [**Original post**](  **tldr:** Pandemic stocks had no fundamental changes to their services and products in the last 2 years. AAPL had some substantial changes that came during the pandemic.  It makes a lot of sense that a lot of companies are normalizing back to pre-pandemic values because people are slowly easing back to normal life. This has led to crashes of 20-80% for many companies.  AAPL is still up \~100% since the pandemic. What are the reasons why AAPL won't drop back down too?  Here are my 6 reasons:  **People severely underestimated how much impact the Trump administration destroying Huawei phones had on Apple.** Apple benefited hugely as people bought iPhones instead of Huawei. In China, Apple is now the #1 smartphone maker again. Two years ago, I would have said this is impossible because of how strong Chinese phone makers have been and have been growing. In hindsight, the moment Trump announced the ban was the moment AAPL should have exploded.  **5G super-cycle** came during the pandemic  **Superior supply-chain management during the pandemic allowed Apple to gain permanent market shares.** In the US, the iPhone has surpassed Android in marketshare and is accelerating, which I thought would never happen again.  **Mac transitioned to Apple Silicon during the pandemic,** which is beating the pants off Intel and AMD chips in performance and performance per watt. Apple is now the fastest-growing computer maker and they're just getting started. The PC market is $150b/year, and Apple only has an 8% market share. If Apple is able to go up to 20 to 30%, that's a very respectable increase in revenue.  **Apple is expected to eventually enter some of the hottest markets during the pandemic** which were electric vehicles, self-driving cars, and the metaverse. While existing companies in those markets have dropped off, Apple hasn't even released a product for them yet. This means AAPL never actually caught the hype for these categories during the pandemic.  **Investors never really caught onto Apple's new strategy until recently which involves gaining market share and selling services.** Apple is no longer just serving the premium markets. The old saying "Apple products are overpriced" is no longer true. For $330, you can buy a new iPad. $250 and get the iPhone SE. $400 and get an iPhone SE. And I'm guessing Apple is planning a cheap Macbook SE to take PC market share too. These are excellent value products and serve as the entry points into Apple's iron grip ecosystem. Once you're in with one product, you can't get out. Next thing you know, you're buying Airpods every 2 years, subscribing to Apple Music, getting Apple Fitness+, upgrading to a Macbook Pro, using Apple Pay which gives Apple a % of the transaction, buying virtual items in stupid mobile games, etc...,;,; 2023-06-09 11:06:42]
[Why do so many growth stocks have a p/b of less than .1 now,;,; I understand that as the cost of capital increases unprofitable companies will be hit the hardest but it feels like there is a major disconnect in the valuation of the top 10 companies vs many of the growth companies. Apple is trading at a p/b of 48 and a forward p/e of 28 yet are doing little in terms of innovation and are just sitting on their cash while I can think of probably 30 companies I probably can‚Äôt name here due to market cap with years of run way based on current cash burn and innovating rapidly in a untapped market being valued less than like they just declared bankruptcy. Apple seems more like the coke of our generation but it‚Äôs valued like it‚Äôs Airbnb in 2020 while the apple of the next generation is probably trading at less than its liquidation value,;,; 2023-10-24 19:32:42]
[Why is Nvidia so cheap?,;,; Nvidia's valuation based on forward earnings is cheaper than it's ever been since it's data centre business took off. Why is this? Do investors not believe it can continue growing after it's already grown so much? This sounds a lot like what people were saying when Apple hit $1T and look how that turned out.  Do you think NVDA is a smart long term buy. Will their software services lock people into their "ecosystem" to make up for GPU sales that will eventually slow?,;,; 2023-12-16 10:04:44]

I believe AI is gonna drive the new bullrun for the next decades.        But I have problem finding good AI gems.        As of now we can only find AI stocks like META APPL AMZN GOOG all of the big tech giants which already have a huge market cap.

[‚ÄúIf only I invested in that company when I first started using their product‚Äù,;,; It‚Äôs a tale as old as time, or at least a tale as old as the stock market.   ‚ÄúIf only I invested 1000 dollars in apple when I first bought that iPod back in 2005.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf only I invested in Netflix when i first subscribed!‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf only I bought Google shares when I first googled something.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf only I bought dominos shares the first time I ordered dominos.‚Äù  Every few months I find myself having these thoughts.

I have tried this approach the past few years and it has been successful. I bought Etsy shares when I first started to use Etsy. I bought Celsius shares when I first started drinking Celsius. Also, got some planet fitness stock when I first started going there on a regular basis.

[Which company are you willing to buy its shares but never their products/services?,;,; I am curious if you all have such cases. I've learned over the years that it's easier to invest in companies whose products/services I use but it's not really the best strategy as personal biases apply (ex: I use ASOS a lot for my clothes but their share has been getting hammered since the post-pandemic peak).  So, I've decided to actually search for solid companies to buy, even if I don't buy their products. Two quick examples of mine:  1. AAPL: Probably the most well-run company in recent years. I never owned a single Apple product, as I've always considered them overpriced and my stubborn-ass being fixated on android phones and microsoft products. But I cannot dispute how well the company is ran and able to secure a loyal customer line and solid profit margins year after year.  2. TSLA: Personally, I don't ever plan on buying a Tesla car and I also don't really like Elon as a person. But I still have to acknowledge some of the advantages that Tesla has as a company, especially their data collecting systems. I think Tesla has a great future and even if I'm not a fan of Elon, I can still put my biases aside and realize that there's ton of experienced investors who trust him. He has a great track record of building companies so that's a risk I'm willing to take (TSLA is like 3-4% of my portfolio)  Do you have any similar examples?,;,; 2023-05-29 14:12:18]

They cited the ongoing AI boom as a key driver, expecting strong AI server momentum to surpass projections and continue outpacing supply. This trend is anticipated to persist through 2025, benefiting from a clearer understanding of US Cloud Service Providers' capital expenditures.        The bullish outlook aligns with Nvidia's impressive 2023 growth, with its shares surging over 200% year-to-date. The success of AI solutions like ChatGPT has stimulated this growth and propelled Nvidia into the ranks of trillion-dollar companies, alongside Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia's upcoming fiscal Q2 2024 earnings report is highly anticipated after the company's optimistic guidance of $11 billion in revenue, a substantial leap from Wall Street's $7.15 billion estimate.

[Tesla net income and earnings drop more than 20% from last year,;,; Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.  Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv  Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates  Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.  Automotive revenue, Tesla‚Äôs core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.  Tesla‚Äôs first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.  The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.  Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.  Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.   Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management‚Äôs consideration were seeking updates on the company‚Äôs trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company‚Äôs energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.  In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.  A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day‚Äôs drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.  According to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.  Tesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023.

TSMC also claims it is on track for its own 2 nm process node in 2025 and already enjoys the patronage of major customers including Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, MediaTek along with Apple.

[Softbank files for ARM IPO. Looking to raise $8-10b. I'm not buying.,;,; Original post: [  **Edit: People are very confused about how ARM licensing works. Read this explanation first:**  &gt;ARM licenses its [ISA]( and/or stock CPU designs to companies. Some companies license both. They pay more. Some companies only license the ISA. They pay less. Apple only licenses the ISA, for example.   Apple's ARM-based designs actually compete with ARM's stock designs. This is why your iPhone is always faster than Android phones.   Yes, Apple is both a customer and a competitor to ARM.   Stock ARM chips are used by companies like Qualcomm, Mediatek, etc. But slowly, these companies are moving away from them and they're designing their own ARM-based chips. This means ARM will make less money from them and they too, will become both customers and competitors to ARM.   ARM's biggest customers are an existential threat to ARM's most profitable business.  I'm not buying. While I believe that ARM CPUs will continue to take marketshare away from x86 on laptops, desktops, and servers, I don't believe the company will be that profitable.  Despite licensing its IP and being at the core of the mobile world, ARM's business model makes peanuts compared to Apple, Qualcomm, AMD, Intel, Nvidia. ARM's last reported revenue was $2b/year. Apple makes that in 1.5 days. Microsoft makes 88x more. Intel makes 39x more. Qualcomm makes 17x more.  In essence, ARM can't compete with the big boys and far more profitable companies are poaching their talent. Take for example, Mike Filippo, a lead architect at ARM, was poached by Apple then poached by Microsoft.  ARM simply can't compete with the money that big tech can throw at their top employees. If you're a top student graduate, you're going to Apple/Intel/AMD/Nvidia. You're not going to ARM Austin Texas. Whenever a big tech company wants to build a custom ARM chip, they go raid ARM talent.  This basically means ARM won't be able to match the performance of big tech designs with their stock ARM cores. And it shows because Apple Silicon is far ahead of stock ARM cores, Qualcomm themselves will be building custom ARM cores again, and Ampere is [ditching stock ARM cores]( for their own custom server cores.  Companies that only rely on the ARM ISA pay far less in licensing fees than companies that also license ARM core designs.  Nvidia buying ARM would have injected the capital needed to compete with Apple, Qualcomm, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, AMD, Intel designs and future designs. And it would have been cool to see ARM SoCs with Nvidia IP. I was/am [one of the few people]( on Reddit who actually liked the deal. The vast majority of people were in the camp of "zomg Nvidia closed source monopoly price fixing omg". Reddit hive mind is real.  Anyways, I'm bullish on custom ARM designs long-term. I'm bearish on ARM the company because their stock cores can't compete with high-end custom ARM cores and high-end x86 cores. If their stock cores can't outperform custom cores, then they will be reduced to small licensing fees forever. This doesn't justify their $40b+ valuation. Every big player in the mobile space is making tens or hundreds of billions. Somehow the tech that is crucial to the mobile world is making peanuts. This isn't going to change and might get worse.  ARM is essential but not a cash cow and has no potential to be a cash cow.  There is no doubt that Softbank saw the same thing and wanted to unload ARM. First, by trying to sell it to a company that valued its technology more than its financials. Now by trying to IPO. Buyers beware.,;,; 2023-05-01 13:12:08]

[Tech leaders are calling for an A.I. pause because they have no product ready, Palantir CEO says,;,;   Palantir‚Äôs boss Alex Karp opposes the idea of a pause in artificial intelligence research, in contrast to an open letter from the Future of Life Institute signed by some of the biggest names in the tech industry. The letter, which has garnered over 31,000 signatures including names like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, called for a pause on AI research on models larger than GPT-4, which powers tools such as ChatGPT. The letter also said that if ‚Äúsuch a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.‚Äù Speaking to BBC Radio in an interview broadcast Thursday, Karp said he is of the view that ‚Äúmany of the people asking for a pause, are asking for a pause because they have no product.‚Äù  He added, without naming anyone, that this is because ‚Äúpeople who have nothing to offer want to study AI,‚Äù but by taking a pause, this could lead to adversaries stealing a lead in not only commercial applications, but also military applications. To him, ‚Äústudying this and allowing other people to win both on commercial areas and on the battlefield‚Äù is a really bad strategy. When asked if what he wanted was an ‚ÄúA.I. race‚Äù akin to the arms race of the Cold War, Karp simply stated that ‚Äúthere is already an A.I. arms race, it‚Äôs just we‚Äôre ahead, [and] it‚Äôs not like if we slow down, the AI race will stop.‚Äù  He pointed out that the ‚Äúsingle most important event‚Äù in this race is not large language models like GPT-4, but instead how AI has been utilized in military applications. Karp points out that Ukrainian forces have used Palantir technologies to gain a technological edge over invading Russian forces. A report from The Times in December 2022 revealed that Palantir‚Äôs AI has allowed Ukraine to increase the accuracy, speed and deadliness of its artillery strikes despite having comparatively smaller artillery forces. Palantir sells software to governments and private sector organizations which help them analyze large quantities of data. The advent of this AI-powered software on the battlefield ‚Äújust throws down a gauntlet to every single country in the world,‚Äù Karp said. He added, ‚Äúespecially [to] our adversaries, they cannot afford for us to have this advantage. And so, the race is on. There‚Äôs only a question of do we stay ahead or do we cede the lead.‚Äù,;,; 2023-06-09 12:24:41]
[Ultimate Nvidia DD (The Best),;,; First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens.        It seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark.    No, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space.        First, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently?        You could say it‚Äôs because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood.    It would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT.        AI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks.        How did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype?    Because a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it‚Äôs not just any Product. It‚Äôs a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.    An AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.        This General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).        This general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.        They gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.        How did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else.        Why did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:        \- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees        \- Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)        \- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)        \- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers        The Analogy:        ‚ÄûPrivate customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).        TSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.        The TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.        At the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.        Nvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.        Everyone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.        What is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.        Does this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.‚Äú        \----        NVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.        Someone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that‚Äôs their moat. This tells me that the person doesn‚Äôt know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.        NVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They ‚Äûonly‚Äú design them.        Which company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It‚Äôs TSMC.    TSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.        So there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big ‚ÄûChip Design Company‚Äú. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult ‚Äúmoat‚Äù part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.        There are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.        So which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.    Do you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?    This is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.        Building a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.        AMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.        Intel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they‚Äôre building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.        According to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.        Now, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!        Ok, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:        ‚ÄûHowever, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple‚Äôs GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.        Since then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple‚Äôs commitment to developing its own graphics technology.‚Äú (Does Apple use Nvidia? (ts2.com.pl)        Because you are all regarded, here are the links where major companies have declared that they will design their own chips:        Microsoft: Microsoft is finally making custom chips ‚Äî and they‚Äôre all about AI - The Verge        Meta: Exclusive: Meta to deploy in-house custom chips this year to power AI drive - memo | Reuters        Google: Google Training Gemini On Its Own Chips Reveals Another Of Its Advantages (forbes.com)        ChatGPT: Exclusive: ChatGPT-owner OpenAI is exploring making its own AI chips | Reuters        In the meantime, Meta and Microsoft say they will buy AMDS new AI Chip as an alternative to Nvidia: Meta and Microsoft to buy AMD's new AI chip as alternative to Nvidia (cnbc.com)        Since I feel so validated by the links above, I'll stop writing my DD, which would have additionally dealt with NVIDIA's past as a company (acquisitions) and the tricks to gain advantage in the consumer graphics card market (Raytracing, PhysiX).,;,; 2024-02-16 18:18:36]

My first purchase was 3-3.5 years back when it was $14 and I kept on buying till it was $30. PLUG breached $75 and guess what, I never sold it. I went "long". Today, as I sold over 1000 shares accumulated over these years at 2.95$, I'm realizing the importance of reading annual and earnings reports. It was always going to end up a penny stock and it's not even a benefit of hindsight. The stock never deserved to go beyond a buck.   Just an advice to all the bag holders out there. Don't let emotions and news interfere with business numbers. Fundamentals will always trump everything. I'm glad my Apple and Microsoft are 50-80% up but well, PLUG will remain my life lesson on doing due diligences, not getting caught up in meme stocks, always setting a stop limit sell price, and um not being stupid in general  Peace out.

[Which stocks were predicted to be the next FAANGs and are now biting the dust?,;,; I started investing about 5 years ago in 2018 and hence relatively a beginner. In the last few years several stocks were hyped to be the next FAANGs to generate 100-1000x returns. Some of them were     * PTON - predicted to be the like Nike with $250B+ market cap * ZM - predicted to be a company where millions of people collaborate for work, 200B+ market cap * APPS - predicted to be next TTD (like 40B+ market cap) * OPEN - the next Amazon with $500B+ market cap  &amp;#x200B;  There were many other predictions which sounded ridiculous then, but has now become a reality or  getting there. (Say for eg: In 2018 Tesla car owners were really happy with what they bought and predicted it to be like Apple of EVs but I did not believe and did not invest. This was when TSLA was below 50B market cap. There was another narrative that Nvidia will be the biggest company in the world in next 7-10 years  which I missed too and its now on its path.)

[Bank of America $BAC is facing $100 billion in paper losses in bond markets, due to interest rate increases,;,; Bank of America $BAC is facing $100 billion in paper losses in bond markets, due to interest rate increases (similar to why Silicon Valley Bank $SIBV and First Republic $FRC collapsed).        The losses are weighing on BofA's net interest margin, an important gauge of performance. BofA's stock has dropped 15% this year, making it the worst performer of any of its large rivals.        Although BoA insists that these losses are merely on paper and it doesn't intend to sell these bonds, the reality remains that the bank's potential to generate income from its customer deposits could be significantly limited.        The losses are the result of a strategy the bank implemented three years ago, when it pumped $670 billion in pandemic-era deposit inflows into debt markets.        The value of BofA's securities portfolio has plunged as yields have risen and bond prices have fallen. At that time, bond prices were high and yields were low. However, as yields have risen and bond prices have dropped, BoA has seen a staggering loss in the value of its portfolio. This loss is double the figure reported by its biggest peers, reflecting the bank's aggressive strategy to favor bonds over cash.        BofA's chief financial officer, Alastair Borthwick, said the bank is in the process of winding down its securities investments.,;,; 2023-06-30 13:54:30]

That of course will not be true if there will be a credit event, but I think the chance is very small, and the government would step in as they did in March.  However I do think the magnificent 7 will likely underperform, as their valuations are stretched.

[S&amp;P 500 rallies 1% to all-time high, surpassing previous record set in 2022: Live updates,;,; The S&amp;P 500 closed at an all-time high on Friday as investors returned to buying equities in force in recent days following a short-lived market stumble to start the new year.  The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.23% to settle at 4,839.81, surpassing both the prior record intraday and closing highs. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which set its own record at the end of last year, added 395.19 points, or 1.05%. The Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.7%. The smaller, more tech-focused Nasdaq-100 gained 1.8% to also hit a record high.  All three major averages are now in positive territory for 2024, with the 30-stock Dow going green during Friday's rally.  Following a 19% loss in 2022, the S&amp;P 500 roared back in 2023, posting a 24% gain as the economy skirted a recession that many had expected and inflation came down to levels that allowed the Federal Reserve to pause its interest rate hikes. The benchmark came close to reaching a record following a forceful fourth-quarter rally, but ultimately fell short. The market rally paused a bit to start 2024 as investors took some profits in the Big Tech leaders like Apple.  But they returned to buying those tech leaders in recent days. Friday's milestone confirms that the stock market is officially in a bull market that began in October 2022, and not just a bounce within a bear market. The S&amp;P 500 is up more than 35% since that low.  "In the mind of the investor, [companies] leading in AI or having a product set that's differentiated in the tech space are very, very strongly leading the market. That's been a wave that's persisted throughout the remainder of last year and into 2024," said Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.  The tech sector gained 2.1% on Friday and jumped more than 4% during the trading week, making it the S&amp;P 500's best-performing sector week to date.  Whether the broader market index can maintain its growth momentum in 2024 "is going to be a question of whether the Fed is able to stick a soft landing or not," Stucky said. He noted that the driver of the S&amp;P 500's growth in 2023 was tied to multiples, rather than earnings.  "Multiples rise coming out of economic slowdowns, because investors are pricing in a recovery. If that recovery doesn't materialize, then you do have to question the sustainability of not only holding on to new highs, but making new highs beyond that," Stucky added.  Fresh consumer data on Friday indicated that consumers are becoming more confident on the economy and inflation. The University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers showed a 21.4% year-over-year jump to reach its highest level since July 2021.  Insurance company Travelers rose more than 5% after posting an earnings beat. Schlumberger gained nearly 2% after beating on top and bottom lines, and Ally Financial surged over 10% after reporting strong quarterly results and a sale of a business unit to Synchrony Financial.   2024-01-19 21:20:02]
[Facebook wants to charge EU users $14 a month if they don't agree to personalized ads on Facebook and Instagram,;,; Meta is considering introducing subscription-based, ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The move aims to comply with the EU's new ad privacy regulations. The subscription fee would start at around ‚Ç¨10 ($10.50) for desktop users and rise to about $14 for mobile users, accounting for commissions charged by Apple and Google's app stores. The subscription model is still under review for compliance with EU laws. This comes after Meta faced a $1.3 billion fine from European regulators for data privacy violations.  **Regulatory Arbitrage**: Meta's decision can be viewed as a form of regulatory arbitrage, aimed at circumventing the stringent data privacy laws enforced by the European Union. Given the EU's propensity for imposing substantial fines, this move could serve as a risk mitigation strategy, thereby stabilizing the company's regulatory profile.  **Revenue Diversification and Financial Stability**: The introduction of a subscription-based revenue model is a strategic pivot away from the increasingly volatile ad-based revenue streams. This diversification could serve to stabilize Meta's cash flows, thereby making it a more attractive and less risky investment in the long term.  **Market Test for Global Scalability**: The European market will act as a bellwether for the viability of this new revenue model. A successful implementation in Europe could pave the way for a global rollout, offering a significant upside potential for revenue growth and stock appreciation.  **Industry Precedence and Competitive Moats**: By being the first to introduce a subscription-based model in the social media landscape, Meta has the opportunity to build a competitive moat. This first-mover advantage could deter competitors from entering the space, thereby consolidating Meta's market share and potentially driving up its valuation.  **User Adoption as a Leading Indicator**: The rate of user adoption will serve as a leading indicator for the success of this initiative. High adoption rates could signify a paradigm shift in consumer preferences, moving away from ad-supported to subscription-based models. This could have a ripple effect on Meta's long-term revenue and profitability metrics.  Article from [Business Insider]( 2023-10-03 15:16:49]

[Microsoft earnings are out ‚Äì here are the numbers,;,; Microsoft reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.  Earnings: $2.45 per share, vs. $2.23 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.  Revenue: $52.86 billion, vs. $51.02 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.  Revenue is projected to be up 3% from a year earlier, which would mark a second straight quarter of growth below 10%. Before that, percentage expansion had been in double digits in every quarter since 2017.  Results are expected to be weakest in Microsoft‚Äôs personal computing division, which includes Windows operating system licenses sold to PC makers, along with Xbox consoles and Surface devices. Research firm Gartner estimated that PC shipments declined 30% in the quarter.  Microsoft‚Äôs Azure cloud business remains a bright spot for the company, but growth is slowing. Analysts surveyed by CNBC expect 26.5% growth from a year earlier, while analysts polled by StreetAccount predict 27.2% growth. Microsoft doesn‚Äôt disclose the size of its Azure business in dollars.  In the fiscal second quarter, revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew by 31%, down from 35% in the prior period.  Investors have another reason to be excited about Azure, which has aligned itself with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.  During the quarter, Microsoft announced a new multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI and said it would draw on the company‚Äôs artificial intelligence models for a new version of its Bing search engine and enhancements to the Microsoft 365 productivity software.   Microsoft shares have risen 17% so far this year, while the S&amp;P 500 index is up less than 8% over the same period.  Executives will discuss the results with analysts and issue guidance on a conference call starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.  Source:  2023-04-25 20:10:57]

[Was the Activision Blizzard actually beneficial for ATVI shareholders?,;,; I can't help thinking this was a massive mistake by shareholders to vote for this. This is a pretty amazing company that would have had solid returns for years. But instead shareholders got a bit of a payout and the company was bought for $68 billion which I think will seem pretty measly in a few years. Their IP like Call of Duty and WoW would have kept paying out for a long time. Their financials were excellent and I'm pretty sure their p/e was low 20's at the buyout price. Since then, loads of companies have had their multiples expand- Apple, Microsoft, Google, Meta are all in the high 20's and 30's.   Just seems like a horrible decision in hindsight, even if the company was going through a pretty turbulent period. ,;,; 2024-01-08 01:31:02]

[Disney - earnings discussion,;,; DIS has made the decision to further up its streaming monetization efforts by adopting paid sharing starting in 2024, following NFLX's lead. These price increases come on top of those for Hulu and Disney+ Premium (ad-free) that will increase by 20% and 30%, respectively, starting in October 2023. While these initiatives may accelerate the company's top and bottom-line growth, it is still unclear whether they will be able to increase Disney+'s dwindling US streaming market share to 13% by Q2 of 23.     Long-term, the well-diversified entertainment options provided by DIS, including ESPN and sports betting, across resorts, theme parks, cruises, and streaming, might be a real franchise flywheel. Able to set itself apart from rivals and preserve an alluring value proposition for clients. Disney and Apple have a number of intriguing partnerships for the Vision Pro spatial headset, which will feature Disney+ streaming video and immersive 4D gaming experiences. Although the headset won't be available until early 2024, the media company will probably benefit from its strong IP portfolio and increasingly varied revenue prospects.     Netflix, unlike Disney, has not yet increased pricing, but it has also subtly discontinued the cheapest ad-free package, thereby increasing overall subscription and advertisement profits. Since more customers are likely to switch to ad-supported rates as a result of less discretionary spending, an elevated interest rate environment, and increased ad-free streaming plans, these moves are undoubtedly deliberate.    However, Disney investors should also be aware of Disney+'s diminishing streaming market share in the US, which will drop to 13% by Q2 23 (a 5% decrease from December 2022 and a 2% YoY increase). The increased prices could likely result in more churn and market share losses, increasing the stock's volatility during the ensuing two quarters.          ,;,; 2023-08-27 07:54:26]

[Sam Altman should‚Äôve been CEO of Google,;,; Hear me out, I want to make a bigger point. We read all the time about startups having been founded by former Google employees. Seems like so often you hear about startup so and so being founded by former Google employees, or same employees leaving to fund a startup. It gets you thinking. How can Alphabet display such lack of clarity in their vision, lack of speed, attention, and focus in their other bets (I.e. waymo)?   How can Alphabet lack a gifted visionary when clearly there are so many there?  Is most of this talent locked out of leadership positions? And I get it. Not every talented employee can be CEO, or run every important business. But shouldn‚Äôt they have a real path to lead and run those positions and the brightest of them win?   I look at what‚Äôs there, and hear the current CEO, and he seems like a very nice guy, honestly, he does.

And Apple has to run a much more complex operation spanning hundreds of suppliers, perhaps thousands, yet they do it.   Now leadership is talking about finding outside investors for their other bets businesses, what is supposed to be the innovation lab, chasing moonshots. Why seek outside investors?

The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose customers include Apple (AAPL.O) and Nvidia (NVDA.O), has benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence applications that has helped it weather the tapering off of pandemic-led demand.   Revenue in the final three months of last year came in at T$625.5 billion ($20.10 billion), according to Reuters calculations, compared with $19.93 billion in the year-ago period.  That beat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (TSMC) previous prediction for fourth-quarter revenue being in a range of between $18.8-19.6 billion, and also beat an LSEG SmartEstimate of T$617.1 billion drawn from 21 analysts.     *Source:* [ 2024-01-10 20:51:34]

This means smaller companies might be able to displace bigger companies.  * I expect a period of growth in the next 6-12 months due to rate hike pausing. In these type of environments investors are going to move out of the safe tech bets (like Apple, Microsoft) and get back into more speculative, smaller cap names.  * I already hold stocks like Google, Amazon, and a lot of Apple &amp; Tesla.

[JPM Net Income Surge 67% YoY to $14.5 Billion,;,; JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings Friday that topped analysts‚Äô expectations as the company benefited from higher interest rates and growing interest income.  * Earnings: $4.37 per share adjusted vs. $4 per share Refinitiv estimate * Revenue: $42.4 billion vs. $38.96 billion estimate  Net income surged 67% to $14.5 billion, or $4.75 per share. When excluding the impact of its First Republic acquisition in early May ‚Äî a $2.7 billion ‚Äúbargain purchase gain‚Äù from the government-brokered takeover, as well as loan reserve builds and securities losses tied to the purchase ‚Äî earnings were $4.37 per share.  Revenue rose 34% to $42.4 billion as JPMorgan took advantage of higher rates and solid loan growth. Revenue gains were fueled by a 44% jump in net interest income to $21.9 billion, which topped the StreetAccount estimate by roughly $700 million. Average loans climbed 13%, while deposits fell 6%.  Shares of the bank climbed more than 2% in premarket trading.  JPMorgan has been a standout recently on several fronts. Whether it‚Äôs about deposits, funding costs or net interest income ‚Äî all hot-button topics since the regional banking crisis began in March ‚Äî the bank has outperformed smaller peers.  That‚Äôs helped shares of the bank climb 11% so far this year, compared with the 16% decline of the KBW Bank Index. When JPMorgan last reported results in April, its shares had their biggest earnings-day increase in two decades.  This time around, JPMorgan will have the benefit of owning First Republic after its U.S.-brokered takeover in early May.  The acquisition, which added roughly $203 billion in loans and securities and $92 billion in deposits, may help cushion JPMorgan against some of the headwinds faced by the industry. Banks are losing low-cost deposits as customers find higher-yielding places to park their cash, causing the industry‚Äôs funding costs to rise.  That‚Äôs pressuring the industry‚Äôs profit margins. Last month, several regional banks disclosed lower-than-expected interest revenue, and analysts expect more banks to do the same in coming weeks. On top of that, banks are expected to disclose a slowdown in loan growth and rising costs related to commercial real estate debt, all of which squeeze banks‚Äô bottom lines.  Lenders have begun setting aside more loan-loss provisions on expectations for a slowing economy this year. JPMorgan is expected to post a $2.72 billion provision for credit losses, according to the StreetAccount estimate.  The bank won‚Äôt be able to sidestep downturns faced in other areas, namely, the slowdown in trading and investment banking activity. In May, JPMorgan said revenue from those Wall Street activities was headed for a 15% decline from a year earlier.  Finally, analysts will want to hear what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has to say about the health of the economy and his expectations for banking regulation and consolidation.  Wells Fargo also reported earnings Friday, and Citigroup results are on deck. Bank of America and Morgan Stanley report Tuesday. Goldman Sachs discloses results Wednesday.   2023-07-14 11:39:26]
[Short sellers are betting more than $1 trillion against US stocks after big run,;,; * Total US short interest exceeded $1 trillion as of last Friday, S3 Partners data shows. * The top five shorts are mega-cap tech stocks Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon * That comes after big stock market gains so far this year.  US short interest this month rose to the highest level since April 2022, as investors bet that the current bull run in the stock market is set to falter.  According to data from S3 Partners, the amount spent by short sellers against US stocks hit $1.02 trillion, as of Friday. Those bets came even as they continued to rally earlier this month, costing short sellers $101 billion.  S3 data shows that the top shorts are Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon. As of Friday, their collective short interest topped $83 billion.  The bearish sentiment results from skepticism about how much higher stocks can go. So far this year, the S&amp;P 500 is up 13.5%, and the Nasdaq is up 29%.  But since the Federal Reserve last week indicated more rate hikes are on the table this year, stocks have been on a losing streak.  This year, Wall Street has been caught up in the hype over artificial intelligence companies, which saw their valuations skyrocket and have brought more investors into the market due to "fear of missing out."  But big names have voiced divided outlooks on the AI frenzy. For instance, while Stanley Druckenmiller sees Nvidia as a stock worth holding for the next couple of years, short seller Jim Chanos has demonstrated skepticism towards the stock.  Meanwhile, the prospect of continued hawkishness from the Fed has added to macroeconomic risks. A recent Goldman Sachs report put the odds of a recession in the next 12 months at 25% and warned a downturn could cause a 23% decline in the S&amp;P 500.  Still, if bullish investors win out, short positions could eventually support market gains, as a short squeeze forces more buying and boosts stocks.,;,; 2023-06-24 10:48:34]

Mostly trying to be too cute with long dated call options that went terribly in the wrong direction and expired worthless, credit spreads, chasing some WSB tickers. Basically trading like I'm in a literal casino.

[Is QQQ a better investment than SF Bay Area SFHs?,;,; I posted this on r/RealEstate too but I guess it's a different population there. Today I saw a post that kinda make me regret buying a home in the Bay Area in 2021. Basically the post claimed:  1. Cupertino, CA SFHs are strongly related to APPL stock price. Same as SF Bay Area housing price strongly related to QQQ price. 2. Cupertino Median SFH price went from 1.41m in 02/2013 to 2.45m in 02/2023, which is a 1m net increase. Assume we bought it with 280k downpayment and 6.3k monthly mortgage. 3. In Cupertino, 3 bedroom rent price has been around 4k in the past ten years. If we had choose to rent, put in that 280k downpayment in APPL stock back in 2013, and use the 2.3k monthly cash flow to invest in APPL, we would have ended up with a yearly return rate of 25%.  Since bay area housing price is strongly related to tech stocks, does this mean people should rent in the bay area?  Now I am feeling very bad about putting down a lot of cash in a 1.2m townhouse back in 2021, although at the time I thought it was a deal since the comparables sold for 1.35m.

[How is Robinhood as a stock,;,; I know a lot of retail investors dislike Robinhood because of the whole GameStop, AMC meme stock thing, but keeping that aside (for a moment), it's a pretty decent product- -Their charts aren't the best but they're okay, it's fluid, fast, intuitive and make sense to a huge genz population -They have 24 hour trading on quite a few stocks -The Robinhood gold actually gives you 5% interest rn or even more and also a lot of insights about a company (it set apples price target to 160$ almost 5-6months ago) -The app is fun to use, and for someone new it's quite intuitive, the way they have the options UI makes sense to me  -They also have a bunch of IRA stuff and stock lending (which I haven't explored)  Their equivalent in India called Zerodha is one of the biggest hits rn, so am surprised their American equivalent is so unrecognized.

[Intel - not overvalued amid this euphoric market,;,; Let's summarize the reasons why INTC is at the current price:  * \- Lagging behind in technology * \- Poor track record of management * \- In the middle of a pivotal moment in their history * \- Losing market share in most segments * \- Record low profits amid market saturation and supply chain issues * \- Their AI portfolio misses most of the AI golden rush * \- Alternative architecture ARM is customizable and this spiked in demand these days  &amp;#x200B;  Still, let's underline some facts:  **Market valuation landscape:**  * \- Up in the value chain, the only competitor is AMD. AMD is 5 times smaller in size, yet has bigger market cap. And remember AMD outsources its fabs, with this info alone you can estimate that the apples-to-apples difference in valuation is 25-fold. * \- In the fab front, TSMC is valued 5 times higher than Intel. For reference it has 40% less employees.  **Strategy:**  Currently everything depends on whether INTC will pull out two moves successfully:  * \- Transitioning to a third party fab model (partly becoming another TSMC) * \- Catching up to TSMC's tech  They have plenty of resources to do that, however it will not be done overnight and the clock is ticking.  Everything else (mobile processors, graphics cards, AI) is important and on the right track, but they are secondary and we shouldn't worry too much.  &amp;#x200B;  **Management:**  The CEO is the best they had in a decade by far. CEO is committed to the new strategy, and made INTC lead efforts in supply chain stability, which should not be understated, as this is of high strategic value for countries and partners alike.  If they execute their strategy swiftly, they will be at least remotely comparable to their rivals in market valuation. If they hit several bumps, the current valuation would not seem overvalued.  We already have positive things to say about their execution:  * \- They secured preferential treatment from ASML for next gen litography ahead of what TSMC can do. * \- They approached the 10 biggest clients in the fab business and some already jumped in the bandwagon. Some, like NVIDIA, gave signs they are likely to join. * \- 25% of their Xeon are used for AI workloads and have competitive offers in graphics cards. * \- I noticed that the satisfaction regarding Intel-branded products has increased lately, due to competitors becoming greedy with their last successes.  &amp;#x200B;  **Irrational fears:**  * \- The fear that AMD will leave INTC in the dust due to the rapid growth of their market share:  Hey, it's one thing to believe that catching up is gonna make the parity even, and it's a completely different thing to defend that AMD has some kind of superpower or INTC an unforgiveable defficiency that will lead to an uneven outcome over the long term. 50-50 seems natural.  * \- Intel performance disappointed me / I had losses with this stock:  Relatable, but it's not wise to make decisions on these terms.  &amp;#x200B;  Ngl, this is a long game, but it doesn't look like a bad starting position, especially if we consider the already saturated alternatives.  &amp;#x200B;  EDIT: Thank you for your points of view, they give me more to think about. After all, my goal is to make the most fair case and orient my thoughts, as I see no good or current publication about this.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-07-29 15:16:15]
[should I go for short term investment or stick to long term investment,;,; As a 27M, I been more a long term investor for a decade now holding alot of dividend stocks like RBC and AT&amp;T and some long term growth stocks like Disney and Apple. But I was thinking of trying to go a bit aggressive and with the recommendation and pressure from my mom to invest into Nvidia and Super Micro Computer for short term investment and believing that it will hit to $1000 per share.     My question is, should I invest into aggressive growth stocks like Nvidia and try to only hold it for a few months before selling high or should I still stick to long term investing to keep it consistent and not give me any headache?     For context, I still technically a beginner who despite learning investing since the age of 6 from my parents still couldn't master the nuance of the stock market and still have tons of burn-out and disinterest over  2 decades of learning.    ,;,; 2023-10-10 19:36:08]

[AAPL Calls Or Puts?,;,; Hey y‚Äôall, I was thinking of grabbing those Apple 185c 8/11 tomorrow at open. They fell a good bit and I was thinking it might be a good value play. I‚Äôve seen some other people do the same with Apple calls at various different expiration dates, some of which being the 8/11s, but I have also seen a small number of people say they are buying puts.

[AAPL bet. I need a strategy.,;,; I have a friendly bet of $100. I say AAPL will be below $200 on Sept 6; friend says it will be above. Any ideas on how I can take the wager but hedge my bet? Maybe sell a Sept put vertical?  AAPL Sept 200 strike is trading at 40-delta, so odds are slightly in my favor. I was thinking of selling the 150 put and buying the 140 put in Sept for $100 credit, which has 85% chance of being expiring OTM. Does this make sense? What would be a better strategy?

[Trading rules AAPL,;,; Sorry in advance if this is covered somewhere else. If I wanted to create five trading rules for a 500 share AAPL trading account that does not allow put selling in order to rely more on rules as thought experiment and to make $ in a more dispassionate way, I thought of the following: 1. STO between ATM or 1 standard deviation strikes on 1 day chart between 1-2 weeks to expiry. 2. BTC at 50% profit unless price below 2 SD and less than 75% profit. 3. Hold premiums collected as cash in case of assignment 4. Roll until impossible then rebuy stock and sell ATM strike as buy-write rule 5. Sell one week past earnings. Does this make sense with AAPL? I‚Äôve done OK managing my position but would like to learn how to do better with some automated type rules. Backtesting always seems to prove this is a better method. Thank you,;,; 2024-01-07 05:38:17]

[I want to be hedging my GOOG and AMZN and AAPL shares for earnings......,;,; Not sure which forum to ask.  I own large amounts of shares of the megacaps.

I have 4900 shares of GOOG/GOOGL.  Cost around 25.  I want to buy some puts to hedge, but am not certain on what a smart number would be, balancing the money I might 'waste' if it doesn't dump, versus the number of puts I buy to partially hedge my shares in case it DOES dump.

It's a PUT debit spread that's paid by 2 naked PUTs. What are the downsides?

[Early assignment of the short leg of my Bull Put Credit Spread. Looking for advice.,;,; Hi everyone,  I've just got an assignment notification from my brokerage that the short leg of my Bull Put Credit Spread (**AAPL Sep01'23 185 Put)** has been assigned. It is a long position with a quantity of 300 AAPL shares at an average price of $185.   I currently am unable to hold the shares as my account isn't big enough to do so.  What should I do? I read that I should create a Covered Stock Option and sell my 300 shares and close my long leg (**AAPL Sep01'23 180 Put)** and get back some extrinsic value.  On the other hand, as AAPL's last traded price is at $174.70, should I just exercise my long leg (AAPL Sep01'23 180 Put) and cancel out my long position of 300 shares? What is the benefit of doing so and is it worth considering?  I am new to options trading and I'm surprised that early assignment has happened so quickly to me.  Thanks for your input, it's greatly appreciated.,;,; 2023-08-19 06:44:55]

[Infinite Passive Income on PMCC?,;,; All values here are drawn from the brokerage I personally use.  Lets say hypothetically after a few years of hard work, I accumulate a sum of 100 000 USD and decide to trade Poor Man's Covered Calls with it.  Current date of the hypothetical: Sep 11, 23.  For instance, AAPL stocks @ 178.180  Buy Feb 16, 24 159DTE 170.00C (Delta - 0.6912, Theta -0.0489) @ 18.70  Sell Oct 13, 23 33DTE 185.00C (Delta - 0.03149, Theta -0.0682)  @ 2.24  Net Debit = 16.46  Following the general guideline of 3-12month Deep ITM Call and 30-45days OTM Call with 70-80 Delta and 20-30Delta respectively.  Lets say for simplicity sake, I invest the 100 000USD into AAPL, buying and selling (100 000/1646 = 60.753(3d.p.) ) 60 ITM and OTM calls respectively.  When I sell calls every month once the written calls expire, would I not make 13440 USD (224\*60) per month on premium? Assuming that AAPL stocks do not crash out of nowhere and my Deep ITM returns breakeven. Of course this would be mitigated by spreading out the portfolio on many different stable companies working in different sectors to diversify the portfolio. After wrapping my head around this for a few hours I can't seem to find anything wrong with this line of thought, it however seems too good to be true. What is the risk or danger that I am missing out on? I understand that there is a risk of losing everything if the stock market crashes but as long as the portfolio is managed wisely wouldn't anyone who managed to accumulate 6 figures be able to retire with this plan?  &amp;#x200B;  Follow on question:  When considering choices for selling calls, why is 30-45 day call options recommended, I believe reading somewhere that time decay on option premium is exponential as time to expiry is nearer wouldn't shorting 1 week/2week call options be more profitable?  e.g.  Sell Sep 15, 23 5DTE 185.00C (Delta - 0.1391, Theta - -0.1212) @ 0.41  Sell Oct 13, 23 33DTE 185.00C (Delta - 0.3149, Theta - -0.0682)  @ 2.24  Taking a 5DTE vs 33DTE to compare, the Sep 15 call option makes 0.41 in 5 days which is 0.082 per day while the Oct 13 call option makes 2.24 in 33 days which is 0.0679 (3sf) per day. With this in mind isn't it wiser to sell call options every week leading to more profits? The theta seems to suggest that too, since Theta of Sep 15 call option &gt; Oct 13 call option. Does that mean that we make more money as time goes by?  &amp;#x200B;  EDIT: It appears some of you guys might have slightly misunderstood what I meant in my hypothetical, I do not intend on solely investing on one stock as I mentioned and I quote "Of course this would be mitigated by spreading out the portfolio on many different stable companies working in different sectors to diversify the portfolio." the idea of investing all in AAPL is for the sake of a simpler narrative. Instead by diversifying the 100 000K into stocks in many different sectors, tech, healthcare, energy etc. would this not be feasible?,;,; 2023-09-10 17:40:22]
[Always profitable options strategy?,;,; I just build together this option [strategy]( it seems to garantee a profit. Seems like I am more betting on IV as if IV goes down then I get hit with big losses. But worst case seems to be 0$ profit if the price goes down too much,;,; 2023-11-15 11:59:29]
[Leaps and Bonds?,;,; Hi,  I've an idea around my head.What about... buy LEAPS Call of mega cap or index, and with the rest of the money buy some bonds or t bills (maybe a wheel of that) and sell covered calls (pmcc)?  Example:LEAPS Call of AAPL at strike 100 expiration 360DTE cost \~5500$, the rest 10,000$ you could buy bonds or T-bills and sell calls agains that LEAPS.  If the stock goes to the moon, sell both calls. If the stock goes lateral, "premium" (hehe). If the stock goes down, you lost same as if u were holding 100 shares, and if the stock goes deep in the mud, you only loss your 5,500$ but still having 10,000$ to buy more shares at a discount :)  What do you think about this? Appreciate your comments!  Edit:  I'm making some research about this, and, what the f\* this is the best way to use the capital lol.  [Example of a LEAP on AAPL. ](  Explanation:   LEAPS: 2Y maturity call of AAPL at strike 100 (Delta 90)Buffer: Approximately half of the LEAP, kept for market plunges if it hits strike of the LEAP.

[Execution Speed, OCO Orders, and the Mystery of GOOD TIL CANCEL on TOS. Please help!,;,;  Hey traders,  Anyone got tips for improving trade executions for CBOE indices like SPX or VIX on TOS? You can route to "BEST" or "CBOE," but what's the fastest way? Also, curious where GOOD TIL CANCEL orders are sitting after hours ‚Äì on the CBOE exchange or TOS servers? if the GTC orders are on TOS servers, they may be resubmitted every day when the market opens. With each resubmission, your order essentially goes to the back of the line.  Lastly, what's the deal with OCO orders? Say you've got a 10-lot OCO for AAPL, and 1 leg fills 5 lots. The other resubmits for 5 lots, making you lose your place in the queue. Why can't they just cancel without resubmitting? Feels like this leads to slower, poorer executions. Anyone else experienced this or have insights? ü§î     i.e: BUY 10 AAPL STRIKE A &amp; B . 5 lot STRIKE A got filled. Strike B canceled everything and resubmitted a buy order for 5. so stupid. why cant they just cancel 5 lot for strike B ?    ,;,; 2023-08-13 06:09:04]
[The best option strategy for a 1% income monthly.,;,; Hi Group, I have a large cash (&gt;200k) in the IBKR margin account and have been selling puts on SPY to generate some passive income (500-1k) + IBKR is paying 4% YOY. Recently, I started another strategy on a few stocks like AMZN, TGT, TSLA, &amp; AAPL, where I bought 100 shares and sold ITM call (Buy write strategy). The small amount is only used for a buy-write strategy, it seems to be generating an income &gt; CSP on SPY. Wondering if there are any well-back-tested option strategies for generating 1% monthly. I know there will be assignment risk during the downturn markets, but it is fine for me as I can execute the wheel strategy.,;,; 2023-09-06 14:25:55]
[Long Dated Covered Call: Sound Strategy?,;,; I own Apple stock at 185, and sold an AAPL 230 Jun 2025 covered call, collecting ~$1150 in premium. Apple is trading at 177 today, and my logic is that selling a long dated covered call acts as insurance and I already get the 1150 premium to adjust my cost basis to an extent. If Apple goes to 230 before Jun 2025, then my stock position is great regardless, and I will close the cover call position close to 45 DTE (or should I roll it to the next year?). Just looking for general input as to the soundness (and any potential risks) of this strategy. Also, I would welcome any suggestions to a good cost basis calculator specifically as it pertains to this kind of adjustment. Thanks in advance!,;,; 2023-08-22 21:00:12]
[programmable system to trade options(all failed ideas),;,; I am a 48 years old programmer, I have been learning and buying options and stocks. most options are OTM calls, as I learned the non-linear payoff is the key for retailer. I am trying to establish a programmable system to trade options so that I can live on the cash I have . I have tested out IBKR api to monitor data and send orders.  &amp;#x200B;  given the maturity of the market, I am going through lots of ideas. I have not found one that seems to convince me it will work. as I am full believer of Taleb philosophy, We can only falsify and proof by negate, if there is such idea that can succeed, more than likely I have not tried hard enough to falsify it.  I hope to gain some idea from you guys. I am not selling volatility ever.  1. volatility surface calibration, get tick price from IBKR, based on bid size and ask size, to get reasonable price and using STI model to calibrate volatility surface. then buy options with low volatility. reason fail, volatility of underlying may change rapidly and also some major event may be in the near future, not sure why the academic is obsessed with volatility surface calibration. do you see a way to success? last price of option may not be accurate, give the size of trade, and also MM may be overrun by insiders. 2. I see lots of trade flow monitor site, I believe institutional traders can use program to divide large block into small size. or insider( some executive from biotech company) may place large size bet on options, but is this going to be reliable? some site even promote large block size on AAPL,  AAPL is so liquid that I don't think anyone has any insider information, within last 5 years, AAPL has never made some jumps based on nonpublic information, and they may using calls as a hedge.  so this flow alone can not be reliable. 3. one more thing to try based on 1 and 2, detect large size trade with higher volatility trade , then buying other further out calls with lower strike. 4. maintain a book , with options and stocks, calculate all the greeks, based on volatility surface calibration, not based simply on BS formula. I see Taleb book on dynamic hedging, it involves 7th derivatives, I think that can only be calculated using real data. using programming skills, it is easy to see it is delta neutral, maybe 2nd  or 3rd derivative neutral, maybe this is why the volatility surface is so important, given current surface, the risk of the portfolio is know more  accurately. 5. another way is to play the distribution, i.e, extrapolate the prob. dist. of underlying over 2sd, and using power law to calibrate prob. out of 2 sd, then recalculate option price. one to see it is to use the DTE as one unit of time, say you have 300 day dte, just treat that as one unit of time and estimate the prob. of change of underlying to fit the option price, with computer age, with a prob. dist. of different unit time, option price is easy to calc. 6. market dynamics is not something we play as retailer, and I don't want to speculate, like NVDA gained 25% post earning.  I understand building such a system without any speculation view of the market is extremely hard for retailer,   the process of thinking about and falsifying ideas has somehow made me better understand market risks.  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-07-29 15:36:11]

[Expected Moves, Docusign, Apple and more,;,; First, a couple of earnings moves from last night, GameStop is slightly higher well off its after-hours highs, and now well inside its expected move. UiPath in a very similar situation, slightly higher but off its post-earnings highs outside market hours and now well inside what options were pricing. On the flipside C3.ai Inc (AI)is down about 14%, slightly more than the 12.5% move options were pricing. The big story since late yesterday is AAPL's quick plunge following reports that the Chinese government is extending the prohibition of Apple‚Äôs iPhones. Apple is down more than 7% since yesterday afternoon.  To put that move in perspective, Apple options were not pricing a 7%+ move until late November. In fact, the recent chart in Apple looks a bit detached from current low IV in the options in general, with the stock having just made 7%+ moves several times since late July:  &amp;#x200B;    Apple vol is low historically, with 30-day IV about 23, while the past year's realized vol has been 29. The assumption often with a mega-cap stock like AAPL is that while bouts of volatility happen, the stock will reset to a grind higher at some point with low realized and implied vol. But AAPL has been moving for the past month and change in ways that options continue to underprice.  Docusign is the big earnings after the bell. Options are pricing about a 9% move at the moment.

[Hodling Nvda since it was $7,50 : selling CC to get eventually assigned strategy so I can diversify?,;,; Hi everyone, I've had Nvidia (108 shares) since January 4th 2016 for a cost basis of about $7,50/share (bought AMZN at the same time too, these were the first stocks I ever bought). These are inside a TFSA (Canadian Tax Free Saving Account, equivalent of a Roth IRA in the US but better since I can cash out tax free anytime).

[Do options actually have "TlME value",;,; TL;DR - Time isn't a tangible quantity in options trading and if there's only two market participants then the entire options trade will break even, neither having made any money. The thought experiment demonstrates the market neutrality of the market maker and excludes the bid-ask spread which is their true payment because there's really only two participants in this example and everyone understands the bid-ask spread to be the market maker saying "pay me 2 cents per share to make you a market."  \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The most challenging of Greeks to explain away is Theta because, well, there's a whole gang devoted to it. I'll try to simply explain why it doesn't really exist.  Thought experiment, there's only 2 market participants.  Example using $AAPL $180 strike June30 puts.  Cost of puts: $4.00 (mid-price at close)  Why is it $4.00? For argument's sake, AAPL currently being $180.09 the strike is out of the money. It could be volatility or theta, some combination, etc.  Orrrrrrrr....it could be that a short seller sees what I see (in my thread on shorting AAPL) and wants a $4.00 stop loss. They are willing to pay $4.00 to lock in that stop loss without having to be right or wrong.  It's defined risk, the short seller who buys puts defines their risk by paying the short put seller to take his risk. You the short-put seller acquires this risk.  It's a payment. **Like buying a can of baked beans.**  In this case, what does price do when there's only two people? This is how a market is made. And it illustrates why Theta is imaginary.  The price agreed upon is $180 (the strike price). The short put seller agrees to buy...AT THAT PRICE. He is credited $4.00. And the long put buyer will get to buy at whatever the market price is at the expiration and sell those shares to the put seller at $180 (obviously).  Thus the price immediately falls to $176 and it stays there for the entirety of the life of the option if no other market participants enter this market.  The option expires at $176 with $4.00 intrinsic value and a break even price for both parties.  There never was any real "time value" in the option what-so-ever.  Here's the basic math of it in a nutshell.  The put buyer has $4.00  The put seller has $176.00 (to cover the price of the shares) + $4.00 premium to buy them at $180.00 which is the put buyer's agreed borrowing price. The put seller is the only one with $176.00, however, so why would the put seller buy shares at any more cost to themselves than the bare minimum affordable? Since they agree to a $180 strike they will attribute $4.00 to that and buy the rest of the shares with the remaining $176.  Understand? If you don't understand that basic principle then sorry for not explaining it better.  You are making the market for the counter party (in this case bearish long-put buyer).  We can do this with calls so you understand the short/long a bit better.  When a market maker makes you a market short position they buy shares and agree to sell them to you at a higher price. This makes sense because the market maker is guaranteeing you there will be a market if no one else participates. They do it for a price. Since you're short, that price is necessarily at a loss to you and a gain for the market maker. Thus the price is somewhere higher.  When you buy a call you want a long position but you're SHORT shares. You agree to buy shares but you don't actually have them. Thus you are short shares until you do buy them. I hope that makes sense. The reason this isn't immediately apparent is because the call gives you a right to buy them at a certain price. That's all. You still don't have the shares.  The covered call seller owns the shares, they are "loaning" them to you just a long-share holder loans shares to short sellers for an interest rate.  The covered call seller thus "buys" the shares for you. This is a buy-write.  That buy writer wants the MOST money he can get for his market price, in this case; the price being $180 (strike price) what happens?  He takes the $180 he needs to hold shares at that strike, + $4.00 and buys the shares at $176.00.  Why would they do anything less? He's the only buyer, he'd set the price at lowest cost to him. There is no spread, again there's only these two market participants.  So the price goes to $176.00, instantly.  Unless someone else comes in and bids the price higher it just stays there.  So what's the point of this thought experiment?  Everything here is logically correct. The price would not sit at the strike price it would instantly go to the actual paid-for price.  There's no time value in that any more than there's time value when you buy a can of baked beans.  When the expiration date comes, if no other market participants enter the market, the market was made. How?  * The short put seller who bought at $176 + $4.00 you were willing to pay; hands you the shares at $176 and returns the shares to you at $4.00 under the strike price of $180. He keeps the $4.00 you were willing to pay; you broke even. * The short call seller who bought shares at $176 +$4.00 keeps the shares he bought for you at the price of $176.00 and keeps $4.00 cash. * The short call seller makes obvious sense when you think about it because a short call seller essentially "sells some amount of shares equal to the delta of the option" or in other words, sells some price as a cash dividend. Same difference.  I hope all this has made sense.  The part that's absent in this entire thought experiment is the "time value". It's just not there. Again, it's not there any more than you can say there's a time value to the price of a can of baked beans.  Of course there's a time value in the philosophical sense that someone thinks their time has value. What's time worth to you? An interest rate is "time value".  But it isn't some tangible thing that ticks down until expiration. If there's only two market participants then the entire options trade will break even.  The cost; in all cases, is in fact a defined risk price paid by a long-option holder who wants someone to define their risk for them.  It's a payment for a can of baked beans.  It's not an interest rate, it's not a loan, it has no time value.,;,; 2023-06-02 02:32:37]
[Ways to trade the market that are more capital-efficient than SPY/XSP?,;,; I'm looking to take a short position on the broader market, but 100 day ATM puts for SPY are around $1,000 and I have a small account so I do not want to risk this much.

[The Indicators You Should Be Using,;,;    ## If anyone is trying to sell you an indicator but can't explain exactly what it does or why it works, it's probably junk.   Many traders see technical indicators and try to apply them to every stock they see. On the other hand, professional traders focus on finding an edge ‚Äî a reason why an option or stock might be undervalued or overvalued. Only after they find an edge do they use indicators to determine when the edge exists.   Take Bollinger bands as an example. Bollinger bands show the X standard deviations from the stock price. It's just a math equation using historical, public data. Applying Bollinger bands to the S&amp;P500 (an index with essentially random price movements) won't get you anywhere. At any given time, the S&amp;P 500 is just as likely to go up as down.  # So When Might Bollinger Bands Work?  A pair trade using Bollinger bands could work.   Imagine the ratio between two similar stocks (such as Apple and Microsoft) is fairly constant. Because these companies are fairly similar, you can expect them to move in tandem.   After using statistics to verify the relationships between stock prices are mean-reverting, you could plot Bollinger bands around the ratio of the stock prices. You could use that to determine when one stock is too expensive relative to the other. If the AAPL/MSFT price ratio rose suddenly and touched the Bollinger Band, we could sell AAPL and buy MSFT with the expectation that their relative prices will revert back towards the mean.   This trade works because similar assets should trade at similar prices. Sometimes there is just a little more demand for AAPL than MSFT from institutional funds, and prices diverge a little. However, because the fundamentals of both companies remain the same, prices should converge as demand subsides.   **Mindlessly applying an RSI indicator, MACD, or moving average isn't going to get you anywhere.**   If they really worked, nobody would sell stock during bullish signals. Nobody would buy stock during bearish signals. Everyone can see the same indicators you do. If they worked, you wouldn't be able to make profitable trades.  Many signal groups or other paid services advertise their indicators as the next big thing, perhaps utilizing some fancy form of machine learning algorithm or artificial intelligence. However, there's so much noise in the market that it's easy to look like you found something, even though it's not really there.   # Trading indicators should be built around an idea. They shouldn't be the idea itself.  Good luck, and happy trading!,;,; 2023-03-23 16:50:30]

[Hold or Roll?,;,; Strategy question.  I have several long calls \[AAPL, NVDA, TSLA\] that are now ITM, with 60-80 DTE.  I remain bullish on all three in the short term and my expectation is that they will continue to rise as expiration approaches.   On that assumption, how do I determine whether I'm better off holding, or rolling to a longer expiration/higher strike?  I realize that rolling locks in my profits, and that a longer expiration pushes the worst of theta decay into the future.  But is it really that simple?  Is there no scenario where I'm better off, e.g., sitting tight, waiting for my exit return percentage, and cashing out, as opposed to rolling up and out?  Again, assuming the underlying securities still have some room to rise in the near term.  Delta for these options range from .51 to .72, in case that's of interest.  Thanks in advance!    ,;,; 2023-08-31 18:40:38]
[Usefulness of daily options data for backtesting (esp. bid-ask values),;,; I have acquired daily options data and they give me      Last,Bid,Ask,Volume,OpenInterest (+ IV and greeks)  on each day for each option.  I wonder how useful these Bid-Ask values are for backtesting. I believe they are giving me only **end of day** bid-ask values. I would guess bid-ask at end of day are substantially wider than during the trading day (when I will actually be making my trades in real trading). In this case, the daily options data seems of limited use.  For instance, even with ITM strikes I'm seeing AAPL options with bid-ask spreads at 3% or even more. This seems crazy high.  Any advice appreciated.,;,; 2023-07-10 11:17:19]
[Niche ETF Option Arb Strategy,;,; There's a short-term arbitrage strategy I've been working out. I'm interested in some feedback.  Large trading floors usually have Delta One products where they manage derivative risk. The typical strategy is to short a basket of stocks (i.e. S&amp;P 500) and buy calls on the index. Some times they capture the spread and profit. Most of the time, it breaks even.  But some times these guys will short a custom basket (i.e. NASDAQ 100) and ***only*** buy calls on the big movers (i.e. AAPL, META, etc.). This creates a tremendous amount of delta exposure. Shifting the trade from delta neutral to risk arb. Some times these trades blow up because it is levered 100 to one.  Since learning about this, I've been looking to replicate this trade. But with niche ETFs that have low liquidity and mispricing (i.e. high expense ratios, discounted NAV, etc.)  Three ETFs I've looked at are:  * VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) * Global X Cybersecurity ETF (BUG) * ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK)  These are semi-cyclical, have high turnover and good liquidity.   Example trades are long June 65 HACK calls and long June 29 BUG puts. Or some straddle combination to reduce premiums with a tighter strike price.  HACK has a 16% holding turnover vs 57% at BUG. Both ETFs have similar holdings in cybersecurity stocks but the ownership stakes are very different. The bet is HACK is better managed than BUG. Similar trades can be done with IHAK and CIBR.  With SMH, I would do something similar to the S&amp;P trades and go long specific names (AMD, INTC, etc.) and short the index. Betting against the poorer performers in the supply chain index.  Let me know what you think and if you've tested a similar strategy before.,;,; 2024-01-24 00:56:05]
[Expected Moves this Week: SPY, QQQ, Nvidia, Apple, Costco, Nike, Micron and more.,;,; Last week saw a pop in volatility and several down days following the FOMC announcement. SPY finished the week down 2.9%, nearly 3x the move options were pricing. The VIX closed on Thursday Sept 14th below 13, into a Sept 15th triple witching expiry that saw the expiration of alot of gamma that may have been keeping a lid on market volatility while some bad news piled up. Once that gamma got unwound/expired implied vol began ticking up into the FOMC meeting and then even higher with stocks going lower out of the meeting.   The VIX is now above 17, still slightly below its historical mean but now matching its highest levels since late May. In other words, the low vol, slow grind higher we saw over the entire summer looks to have come to an end, at least for now, with September expiration. Keep an eye on both weekly IV as well as 30-60 day IV as both got very low into that Sept 15th expiry. Stocks that had seen a slow grind higher all Summer were suddenly making large moves in the span of days or weeks that options weren't pricing to happen in the span of multiple months in the future.   For traders, it's helpful to look at recent stock moves and compare to the expected move in the future to see instinctually if options are inexpensive out in the future. Just as an example, NVDA has made several 15% moves in the past month, yet options are not pricing that sort of move to happen again until December expiry:    And Apple has made several moves in the 8-10% range recently, yet options aren't pricing a 10% move until well into the beginning of 2024:       There's no guarantee the volatility will continue, it could stop on a dime again. But, options clearly are still in a hangover from the low vol days of Summer and are still playing catch-up. The weeklies have made the biggest spike so far, now pricing in expected moves about 50% higher than just a few weeks ago. Here's this week's look:  * **SPY expected move this week: 1.5%** * **QQQ expected move this week: 1.9%**  &amp;#x200B;  **Earnings This Week**   *Tuesday*  * **COST** Costco **3.0%** * **CTAS** Cintas Corporation **4.5%** * **FERG** Ferguson plc **5.4%** * **SNX** TD SYNNEX Corporation **6.0%**  *Wednesday*  * **MU** Micron Technology, Inc. **5.3%** * **PAYX** Paychex, Inc. **4.5%** * **CNXC** Concentrix Corporation **9.0%**  *Thursday*  * **NKE** NIKE, Inc. **5.2%** * **KMX** CarMax, Inc. **8.2%** * **BB** BlackBerry Limited **8.8%**  *Friday*  * **CCL** Carnival Cruise Lines **8.3%**  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-09-24 17:04:37]

[Shorting options vs. cash and buying power: I WAS WRONG,;,; **TL;DR** - Shorting options in a Reg T margin account takes initial margin requirements from margin (option) buying power, **not from your cash balance**. You also **do not need a margin loan** to fund the collateral for a cash-secured short option, if your cash balance is less than the initial margin requirement for the short.  **INTRODUCTION**  In [this thread]( I made claims that the initial margin requirement/cash collateral to short options comes from your cash balance only, not from margin equity. Several folks told me, kindly, that I was wrong and explained why. They provided compelling examples of shorting options without taking out a margin loan or impacting cash balance. This gave me enough doubt about my claim that I called three different brokers -- Etrade, Schwab, and TDA -- to confirm, and long story (see below) short, they all confirmed that my claim was wrong.  Just because I'm a mod doesn't mean I'm always right. I'm open to learning and correcting my mistakes. I want to thank NW_Runner, SatisfactoryFinance, and vanilla_sky_33 for patiently informing me that I was wrong and what was right, and doing so constructively and with civility that's extremely rare on Reddit.  Keep reading if you to see what I asked the brokers and what their answers were.  **HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO**  Suppose I have a standard Reg T margin account with 10k in cash and 30k in long shares of marginable securities. I have no margin debt, no positions on margin and no option positions currently. Let's also say that my starting options buying power is 25k, 10k from cash and 15k from margin equity, half the value of the marginable securities held long in the account. I have no outstanding margin debt and no option positions to start with.  Question 1: If I sell to open a short put position on AAPL, 60 DTE, not secured by shares and the initial margin requirement for that short put position is net 20k (25k assignment value, 5k premium collected at open), can I open that position using margin equity directly, without taking out a margin loan? Or must I take a margin loan to cash and increase my cash balance by 10k before I can open that short call position?  Question 2: If I buy to open a long call position on AAPL with a debit of 20k, would that be possible? Would I be using buying power only to do so or would I have to pay interest on a margin loan?  **ANSWERS FROM BROKERS**  I called customer service at Etrade, Schwab and TDA (I have accounts on all three) and asked to talk to a trade desk broker familiar with options trading and margin accounts. It's important to specify the subject matter expertise you are looking for, since the first tier support folks don't usually have trading experience or training.  The first stroke of good luck was that all three brokers gave the exact same answers. That was not guaranteed. I once asked three different brokers at Etrade what the cutoff time was for requesting exercise on call options, and I got 4:30 pm, 5:00 pm, and 5:30 pm as answers! I think one of those answers was just a timezone disconnect, but it was disconcerting to get no answer in common from any of the three brokers from the same brokerage!  For Question 1, what they all said is summarized in the TLDR at the top of this post. The collateral securing a short, if not secured by shares, comes from buying power only. No margin loans needed, no reduction in cash balance. So in the example of a 20k initial margin requirement vs. 25k of option buying power, I'd be left with 5k of buying power and 15k of cash (+5k from the premium credit received). Then there were nuances about whether all that 15k of cash is spendable/tradeable/withdrawable, but I didn't get into those details.  For Question 2, the long call, a margin loan would be required and margin interest would be paid daily. For any opening trade on options that nets a debit, money is first taken from your cash balance. If there's enough cash, that's it, but if there is insufficient cash, the remainder of the debit becomes a margin loan.  Some specific quotes:  "Margin loans are driven by the flow of cash. If cash flows out of the account and goes to zero, that's when a margin loan comes into play. In a short options trade, there is no money flowing out of the account. Cash might be put on hold for the collateral, but you aren't spending down your cash balance. In fact, it ought to go up from the credit you received on the short."  "This stuff is confusing and it is difficult to understand exactly when cash vs. buying power is involved just from the strategy-based margin requirements for options.",;,; 2023-02-27 21:04:12]
[NVDA May 24 earnings strategy,;,; Gaming GPU sales are probably still down, but server/business sales account for 60% of their profit. With the explosion of AI and NVDAs 80% market share for AI processors, they have to potential to beat earnings and shoot even higher. If they miss earning though I think the stock could drop $20-30.   I think the deciding factor is really how much extra revenue they're making from AI hardware. ChatGPT alone runs on 10,000 nvidia processors, each costing more than $10K. Hard to tell really how many AI servers are being constructed.   Last time I asked about earnin predictions here though you guys convinced me to not get AAPL cals because it wouldnt rise high enough, which it did and could have made 300% returns. So I might just do the opposite of the consensus here, but I'm interested to hear anyone's thoughts.   Thank you,;,; 2023-05-18 22:04:48]

[Expected moves this week: SPY, QQQ, FOMC minutes, Jobs number.,;,; Futures are basically flat this morning into a holiday-shortened session. On the economic data front, the ISM PMI number will drop shortly after the open. Earnings reports are super light this week with nothing really of note today. Last week was a very positive one for stocks with the SPY up 2.3% on the week, a move more than double what options were pricing. With the move higher, IV was even lower, with the VIX actually putting in an intraday print below 13 on Friday. Once again, that's low levels of IV that the market hasn't seen since Covid dropped. Considering this is a holiday-shortened week those low levels are likely warranted, or at least understandable as traders do not want to be sitting on long premium during the dog days of Summer trading. But as has been mentioned in this space, it doesn't take much for stocks to move beyond those small expected moves, particularly on weeks like last week where there's a persistent bid in the market on a slow grind higher. Traders should be very very aware of both the risk of long premium, but also of how tight the breakeven levels of short premium trades can be with IV this low. Active trade management with small-win mentalities is how many traders approach these conditions.   For this week, SPY options are pricing just under a 1% move for what amounts to a 3-and-a-half-day week. That could change coming out of the holiday for the final 3 days as traders may re-adjust to more regular market hours. That's particularly true this week as the economic calendar picks up on Wednesday with FOMC minutes, then Thursday ISM services PMI, ADP jobs, and of course the non-farm payrolls on Friday. The earnings calendar is light this week but picks up in the second half of the month with banks and airlines beginning to report mid-month with big tech rolling in late month.   &amp;#x200B;  **Today's expected move (0DTE)**   * SPY 0.4%  * QQQ 0.5%  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market:**     * Tesla Inc (TSLA) +6.13% * Nio Inc ADR (NIO) +4.44% * Micron Technology (MU) +0.19% * Xpeng Inc ADR (XPEV) +7.53% * Lucid Group Inc (LCID) +1.60% * Alphabet Cl C (GOOG) -0.32% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +2.16% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.32% * Unitedhealth Group Inc (UNH) -0.48% * Astrazeneca Plc ADR (AZN) -6.62% * Li Auto Inc ADR (LI) +5.84% * Zhong Yang Financial Group Limited (TOP) -5.22%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**   none of note  Full list here: [Options AI Earnings Calendar](  &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar:**     * At 09:45 AM (EST) S&amp;P Global Manufacturing PMI (Jun) Estimates: 46.3, Prior: 48.4 * At 10:00 AM (EST) ISM Manufacturing PMI (Jun) Estimates: 47, Prior: 46.9 * At 10:00 AM (EST) ISM Manufacturing Employment (Jun) Estimates: 50.5, Prior: 51.4  &amp;#x200B;  **Scanner Highlights:**   Based on the prior day's trading action.     * **Overbought (RSI):** DAL (87), AAL (81), LUV (80), OSTK (80), JBLU (79), JETS (78), AAPL (78), OPEN (77), SNAP (74) * **Oversold (RSI):** OKTA (39), ETSY (39), MU (40), KO (40), TGT (40), ABBV (40), DOCU (41), GLD (41), JD (41) * **High IV:** NKLA (+211%), AMC (+206%), MANU (+172%), AZN (+136%), OSTK (+116%), SOFI (+114%), BUD (+113%), AMGN (+102%), RIVN (+102%), MRK (+101%), SPOT (+100%) * **Unusual Options Volume:** CMCSA (+1401%), BITO (+657%), XLI (+561%), RIG (+556%), OSTK (+531%), NKE (+486%), MSTR (+475%), CCL (+473%), AAPL (+450%), JPM (+440%), UPS (+398%)  Full lists here: [Options AI Free Tools](  &amp;#x200B;  **Chart of the Day:**  SPY options are pricing less than a 1% move for the week but that could change out of the holiday.  &amp;#x200B;   2023-07-03 13:22:44]
[New Open-Source Options Backtesting Framework in Python,;,; I am in the process of building a backtesting framework in Python that's specialized for trading options. The framework allows you to:  * Integrate external data * Manage a complex portfolio with multiple asset classes and instruments * Extend the framework to build your own custom logic * Kickstart development with templates (e.g. SPX straddle and put spread)  My framework is quite a bit different than other strategy backtesting frameworks.  First, we conceptualize a portfolio differently in that we allow a user to manage many different positions of different asset classes and instruments. Here's example code of a portfolio:      Portfolio(         trades=[             Trade(                 positions=[                     Position(                         instrument=CommonStock(ticker="AAPL"),                         size=1                     ),                     Position(                         instrument=EquityOption(                             underlying=CommonStock(ticker="AAPL"),                             payoff=VanillaPayoff(                                 option_type=OptionType.PUT, strike_price=100                             ),                             exercise_type=AmericanExerciseStyle(                                 minimum_exercise_date=date(2021, 1, 4),                                 expiration_date=date(2022, 1, 3),                                 cut=NysePMCut(),                             ),                             denomination_currency=Currency.USD,                             contract_size=100,                         ),                         size=1,                     ),                 ]             )         ]     )  Second, my framework allows you to quickly compose a strategy using basic buildings blocks we call "triggers" and "actions". A trigger provides conditional logic to determine if an action should be executed. An action transforms a portfolio (e.g. enters a trade or rolls into a new position). You can easily build your own custom triggers and actions. Here's example code of a SPX straddle with delta hedging strategy:      underlying = EquityIndex(ticker="^SPX", index_type=EquityIndexType.PRICE)     roll_rule = RollRule(         calendar=MarketCalendar("NYSE"),         period=Period(n=2, unit=TimeUnit.MONTH),         convention=BusinessDayConvention.FOLLOWING,     )     data_source = MarketDataSource()          strategy = TriggerActionStrategy(         [             TriggerAction(                 trigger=InitializationTrigger(),                 action=EnterTradeAction(trade_callable=enter_trade)             ),             TriggerAction(                 trigger=MinimumExpiryTrigger(                     period=Period(n=1, unit=TimeUnit.MONTH)                 ),                 action=AggregateAction(                     actions=[                         RollRestrikeEquityOptionAction(                             roll_rule=roll_rule,                             moneyness=Moneyness(level=1.0, type=MoneynessType.SPOT)                         ),                         RollEquityFutureAction(                             roll_rule=roll_rule,                         )                     ]                 )             ),             TriggerAction(                 trigger=MarketTrigger(                     data_definition=EquitySpotDataDefinition(ticker=underlying.ticker),                     threshold=BelowDifferenceThreshold(                         value=-0.03,                         computation_type=ComputationType.PERCENTAGE,                         additional_threshold=AboveDifferenceThreshold(                             value=0.03,                             computation_type=ComputationType.PERCENTAGE,                         ),                         operator=LogicalOperator.OR                     )                 ),                 action=DeltaHedgeEquityOptionAction(                     underlying=underlying,                     roll_rule=roll_rule                 )             )         ]     )  Before open-sourcing the project, I am hoping to get feedback and onboard some beta users. Please comment some of your preferred features below (e.g. handling transaction costs), and DM me if you're interested in testing the framework early.,;,; 2023-03-21 16:56:59]
[Earnings Post-Mortem for the Week of 7-31-23,;,; I watched 37 stocks this week that had been winners of 3 or 4 of the past earnings when it comes Straddles/Strangles. My strategy is usually about a week before to enter a position of Call +1/ Put -2, which usually evens out the pricing between the legs. Of those: 2 were breakeven, 18 were winners, and 17 were losers.   So statistically, I would call it a draw.   What you were really hoping for was that you played one of the following:   \- Arista (ANET): +312%   \- Fortinet (FTNT): +163%   \- Generac (GNRC): +115%   \- Apple (AAPL): +43%   \- Sunrun (RUN): +28%     Winners that had only exceeded the implied move for 2 quarters out of the past 4:   \- Catepilar (CAT): +220%   \- Amazon (AMZN): +62%  &amp;#x200B;  The interesting thing is, if you overlay the Equity Surprise index ([ over this, it's almost exactly what we would expect. We are right around +80, and historically the index almost never goes above that, so historically, we should start getting more negative surprises.. as we should be nearing a peak.,;,; 2023-08-04 23:38:14]

[Expected moves, NFP jobs, SPY, VIX Apple and more.,;,; Non Farm Payrolls drop at 8:30 ET and suddenly take on new significance after the market reaction yesterday to ADP employment data. As pointed out in this space a few times recently, stocks have largely ignored rising treasury yields (higher interest rate assumptions) over the past few months as the fears of a bad recession faded a little. But with recent strong data and hawkish words from the Fed, yields have plowed higher and traders showed some concern for the first time in a while the past 2 days. The 1-year yield is now at its highest level since 2000, the 2yr traded yesterday at its highest level since 2006 and the 10yr is at its highest level since 2007. Where yields go next are likely to affect the market's next moves and the NFP this morning will be the last data point in a slew of news we received in the second part of this week. The VIX got as high as 17 yesterday, indicating some renewed interest in option buying. It pulled back a bit late and is now 15.80. But this is the first bit of life option buyers have shown in months. Futures are basically unchanged into the NFP print. The expected move for SPY today is about 0.5% with the QQQ about 0.8%.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Movers:**     * Gorilla Technology Group Inc (GRRR) +59.33% * Prestige Wealth Inc (PWM) +116.67% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +3.38% * Zhong Yang Financial Group Limited (TOP) +13.64% * Tesla Inc (TSLA) -0.30% * Alibaba Group Holding ADR (BABA) +2.81% * Xpeng Inc ADR (XPEV) -2.69% * Nio Inc ADR (NIO) -0.42% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.03% * Levi Strauss &amp; Company Cl A (LEVI) -7.17% * Alphabet Cl A (GOOGL) -0.17%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**     * ImmunoPrecise Antibodies Ltd.

[Expected Moves this week, SPY, VIX, QQQ, MU and more.,;,; SPY was lower last week by about 0.6%, again, inside what options were pricing. Implied vol closed extremely low into the weekend, with SPY some at-the-money SPY weekly options sporting single-digit handles. That IV should reset a bit higher out of the weekend but overall vol remains historically below average and at multi-year lows. The VIX closed last week below 13.50. Of course, vol could always go lower, but it's getting to the point where those lower moves would be quite small. In general the 12-13 range in the VIX floor over the past 5 years and only on rare occasions over longer time horizons do you see it closer to 10. That's not to say it can't remain this low for a long time, but it can't get much lower. One thing to note from the past 2 weeks, the daily realized moves of the market versus what 0DTE options had been pricing has started to tip a bit in the favor of the market moves over the expected moves, particularly in the QQQ. That kind of action tends to put a floor on IV as well as option trading in same-day expiry is heavy volume and being more or less re-priced each day based on the prior day's result. Futures are flat to lower to start off the week.  This past weekend included some political chaos in Russia but markets this week will most likely concentrate on a combo of economic data like GDP &amp; Durable Goods and speeches by Lagarde (tues) and Powell (wed, thurs). SPY options are pricing about a 1.1% move for the week at 10 vol (at the money) although that could get a lift on the open. The earnings calendar this week is slow but steady, with Micron (MU) a highlight on Wednesday.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Actives:**  * Lucid Group Inc (LCID) +7.86% * Tesla Inc (TSLA) -2.27% * Trxade Health Inc (MEDS) +60.43% * Eco Wave Power Global Ab ADR (WAVE) +22.11% * Marathon Digital Hldgs Inc (MARA) -3.30% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.19% * Alphabet Cl A (GOOGL) -1.65% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.33% * Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) +0.11% * Coinbase Global Inc Cl A (COIN) -1.84%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (CCL) Expected Move: 9.75% * Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (CUK) Expected Move: 13.06%  Full list here: [Options AI Earnings Calendar](  &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar:**  * At 10:30 AM (EST) Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index (Jun) Estimates: -26.5, Prior: -29.1  &amp;#x200B;  **Scanner Highlights:**  * Overbought (RSI): CCL (79), META (78), KMX (73), JNJ (72), ADBE (72), LLY (71), AAPL (70) * Oversold (RSI): OXY (31), PENN (31), DOCU (35), CHPT (36), MRNA (36), GS (36) * High IV: MANU (+212%), ATVI (+194%), VMW (+167%), NKE (+107%), AZN (+105%), IBM (+105%), TSLA (+103%) * Unusual Options Volume: KMX (+981%), MARA (+510%), COIN (+468%), SNAP (+416%), CCL (+343%), META (+310%), MSTR (+309%)  &amp;#x200B;  **Chart of the Day**  Some SPY options have seen IV marks below 10 recently.   2023-06-26 11:09:21]
[Buying and Selling the Same Option,;,; Hi all! I‚Äôm new to the sub and options trading in general. Currently I have about $100 I‚Äôm just kind of messing around with to try and understand the basics of options, and then I have 100 shares of FLWS that I‚Äôm leveraging to understand covered calls.   Currently I‚Äôm in a situation where I sold a 1/19 call for $9 strike in FLWS for $0.15 a couple days ago. In the days following the sell, the premium has jumped up to $0.35 as the stock jumped from  about $8.50 to $9.25. I‚Äôm thinking, ‚Äúshoot, of course it goes up immediately. This has been happening every time I sell to open‚Ä¶‚Äù  So, here I am feeling discouraged, and then think, ‚Äúwhy not just buy the option back, and sell it again immediately? Then I get the extra $0.20 premium, and the price is more likely to go down from 0.35 than from 0.15 (so I could close out early if I wanted to)!‚Äù  I‚Äôve been looking around Google and Reddit trying to find if this strategy has a name or is legitimate to do. The closest I‚Äôve found is rolling, but that always seems to be with a different strike or expiration date. I attempted to do it in a multiple leg trade on Fidelity, but an error came up saying I couldn‚Äôt trade for the same option in multiple legs on the same trade. That made me think that it wasn‚Äôt a legitimate strategy, or I wasn‚Äôt seeing the risks that go along with it if it is possible.  Is there a name for this kind of ‚Äúrolling,‚Äù and is it a decent strategy to employ?,;,; 2023-12-04 00:42:59]
[Finding implied volatility, and more!,;,; I'm going to make this quick this is not really a post just where i can explain to a comment i posted. If you don't have a convenient broker that shows you how much the market is pricing in implied volatility like thinkorswim. Where you can see how much the underlying might move up or down within an options contract, you might have a ballpark area way.   I'm going to show a picture of AAPL option chain. looking at the 15 sep 23 expiration where they are pricing about a 6 move up , and down,as you can see on the Top far right. To get the ball park area of about 6 price move you will have to look at the ask on the option chain.  I usually use the put side but the calls side work too.   &amp;#x200B;    We look at the ATM ask price, and add the itm ask price then we will get the ballpark number which in real time is a lot better. On the call side we have a 2.52(ATM) and add the 4.05(ITM)(on the ask) then we get a ballpark of what the market is pricing in right now , which is 6.57. this work for all underlyings i find a little more tricky on the 5 point spreads thought.   More of what the market is pricing in love that number on the top right is a little skewed. Again this is what the buyers are targeting for their profit. Look at this bonus.   &amp;#x200B;    I'm about to delta hedge my bull put spread(XLU is falling so i hedged), which i have to do 4 more steps after it gets filled but seems cool to show. I don't like to just show information i like to show how to control your profits/and losses some times. Hope this is helpful .   &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-09-06 03:03:31]
[Expected moves, Core PCE, SPY, QQQ,;,; Futures are higher this morning. The market still has to digest the Fed's preferred inflation measure of core PCE which drops before the open. It's been a positive week for SPY, up about 1.1% coming into this morning (not counting the futures being higher). That's about in line with the move options were pricing for the week, so a positive day today would take stocks beyond what options had priced. That slow grind in a low-vol environment can be frustrating for option sellers as upside calls are really cheap and really close to the money when a trade is entered... so trade management on a slow creep higher is important. Option vol remains low and may get lower into the close preceding what is a quasi 3-and-a-half day weekend that market makers will not want to be owning a ton of premium into.  **Today's (0DTE) expected moves:**  * SPY: 0.5% * QQQ: 0.7%  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market:**  * Renalytix Ai Plc ADR (RNLX) +41.06% * Genfit S.A.

[Trading supply and demand,;,; I recently began scalping SPY, and have mainly used price action patterns and supply and demand to make my trades. I don't use any indicators. I am new to holding positions for smaller timeframes(anywhere from 5-30 minutes). I won't be able to daytrade for much longer, as I will be out of the house for most of the trading day. Therefore, I'm getting used to scalping now. I want to mostly trade from 6:30 AM PST to 7:30 AM PST. Today was my second day doing this type of trading. Yesterday, I made 85 dollars on my 1k account, setting tight stoplosses. I went 2-0. I will increase my position once I get more consistent, but right now, I'm doing 1 contract positions and 50 dollar stop losses on contracts with a .5 delta.  However, there are some days where the price just shoots up from market open, and no new supply/demand zones form. Today (April 13th) was a day that fit this description. At least, I think it was.  I am curious what others who trade this strategy do when this happens. I tried to make 2 trades today, both of which were losers. The 1st one, I raised my stop loss prematurely. The 2nd, I traded against the trend, which I now realize is generally not the best idea. I only lost 25 dollars, since, as stated for the 1st trade, I moved up my stoploss, and for the second trade, I just knew it would be a loser after a bit (in the long run, i was correct and it did in fact lose much more).  From today's experience, I feel like I should just stick to supply and demand. Should I just not trade during days like this? That is probably better than forcing trades. Or maybe I should look at 2-3 more charts, (QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, AMD)?  Appreciate the help! If anyone wants to give some advice to a beginner trader, that'd be good.,;,; 2023-04-14 03:03:41]
[Earnings expected moves, Amazon, Apple, Coinbase, Draftkings and more.,;,; A couple of giants report after the close, amidst a heavy earnings calendar. On the economic front, we get the NFP jobs number tomorrow morning.  Here's a preview of Amazon and the options setup, which can be a good sense of the overall set-up into an earnings event. The expected move is about 6%. That compares to the most recent earnings moves of -4%, -8%, -7% and +10%. So today's expected move is just shy of the mid of the past 4 earnings moves with the most recent earnings having moved less (-4%).   The IV of the weeklies is about 100. That compares to the 30 day IV of about 43. Of course, the weekly options expire tomorrow, so really they should be thought of as an expected move, and less so as vega. That 30 day IV (44), which is a purer representation of vega, is higher than the 30 day realized vol (how the stock has actually moved over the past 30 days) of just 27. Amazon's realized vol over the past month is quite quiet compared to how its moved over the past year, with its yearly realized vol being 39.   That paints a picture of very high IV compared to the stock's very recent history, but options priced for earnings that are leaning towards a move slightly less than the stock has moved over the past year on earnings. This comes in an overall lower IV and realized vol environment over the past few months.  An Iron Condor, set at the expected move, and $1 wide on the wings, would need AMZN to stay within about 120.50 and 136.50. The bullish expected move lines up very near to the highs of 2023 in the stock, which happened within the past month. Here's how that looks on the chart.  &amp;#x200B;    Apple's expected move of 3% compares to earnings moves over the past year of +5%, +3%, +8% and +3%. Again, low IV compared to earnings over the past year, but AAPL's realized vol over the past month is just 13! Options buyers have not been doing well in those conditions and the low IV into earnings is a reflection of that suffering. 3% is about $6 in either direction.

[could go either way](  If you're on the iPhone train then there is a good chance that a better-than-expected report could send APPL up to challenge the $200 area, so with that in mind, these are the inputs into BB1, basically targeting $200, but I want to cover a range of $192 to $210 and I'm willing to give it around 2 weeks  [target parameters ](  And these were the results   &amp;#x200B;    These are the best-value trades, but unless you're a seasoned trader that fully understands risk, I would just opt to filter to "vanilla" trades   &amp;#x200B;  [the vanilla option](  I actually prefer the choice here anyway..no mucking about, just buy the $200 call, even though you are in a 2 week option it will monetize pretty well even tomorrow if we were to shift volatility lower too    For those Android users out there, if we were to break that ascending wedge then we could easily target the $170 area  I want to give this one a little more time, so Im looking 40ish days out looking somewhere between   [target, anywhere between $165 to $177](  I want to give this one a little more time, so Im looking 40ish days out looking somewhere between  $165 to $177 , aiming for $170.  &amp;#x200B;  [the downside list](  and again filtering "vanilla" trade, BB likes a pretty simple trade.

Throughout the entire sell-off things have been fairly orderly overall. And that is reflected in the fact that the VIX hasn't really gotten above 22, even recently. The 20 area in the VIX had been where the market had seen buyers step in over the past 9 months or so but not this time. Whether that gets resolved with a VIX spike closer to 30 soon or not remains to be seen but traders should be watching that for any sort or capitulation indication of at least this recent selling causing a little panic selling of stocks. 0DTE and weekly IV is certainly higher now with daily expected moves now regularly over 1%.

[Expected moves this week: Bank of America, Goldman, Netflix, Tesla and more.,;,; SPY was higher by 2.5% last week. A much larger move than options were pricing. Vol remains low across the board. To start this week the futures are pulling back a bit and with that, the VIX is starting the week off around 14 (the historical mean is around 19). This is the first full week of earnings season. Tomorrow we get a second round of big bank reports when we hear from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley (Goldman is a day later) as well as a look into online brokerage with Schwab and Interactive Brokers. On Wednesday two of the popular trading names take center stage with both Tesla and Netflix reporting after the close. We also hear from more airlines like United and get an early look at the chip sector with Taiwan Semi on Thursday. And finally a look at consumer credit and spending with American Express on Friday.  A pretty packed Tuesday through Friday so make sure to check the calendar each day. Next week things heat up even more with some mega-cap tech. On the economic front this week is lighter than the past few. We get a speech today from ECB president Lagarde, retail sales on Tuesday, and then housing data and initial jobless claims later in the week. Some expected moves for notable earnings this week.

[There is NO Magic,;,; Strike. A common decision point newer options traders get hung up on is "what strike is best?" This is a completely logical question and the goal of this post is to help those traders understand how to reason through that question themselves.  * First, there is no magic strike. What I mean by this, is there isn't a specific strike that is generally "best". Every single selection comes with trade offs. So I'd offer a shift in mindset from "what is the best strike" to "what strike makes the most sense for my hypothesis". * To start, let's align on some basics. I will break these out by primary traits and how different strikes behave, then the decision point for each. This is a higher level write up and is not strategy specific. It's designed to simply help traders think about strike selection.    * **Delta &amp; Gamma.**       * Strikes that are far ITM have higher deltas, approximating to 1.00       * Strikes that are far OTM have lower deltas, approximating to 0.01       * Both far ITM and OTM have low gamma, however as options move close to ATM, their gamma spikes. Gamma is also greater the closer to expiration we get.       * *Decision point.* Higher delta will move more like stock (eg. a 0.80 delta call will move $0.80 for each $1 move in the underlying, all else being equal), so you benefit from smaller moves more effectively. Lower delta strikes will move less on smaller moves, but as an extended move occurs and gamma picks up, these options compound quickly. This is generally where you'll see 1,000% moves on the premiums.    * **Theta (decay specifically).**       * Strikes that are far ITM or OTM have lower extrinsic value, thus lower theta       * *Decision point.* How do you view theta decay against the other traits listed and how do you value the other traits. For example, if you really didn't care about theta decay an ATM option provides a middle ground in terms of cost and option responsiveness at the expense of theta decay. (This applies to buying or selling. If we buy, we benefit from the potential movement at the cost of theta. If we sell, the potential movement (gamma) can hurt us, but we benefit from theta).    * **Cost.**       * ITM strikes, with higher deltas have higher relative premiums, the further ITM you go       * OTM strikes, with lower deltas, have lower relative premiums, the further OTM you go       * *Decision point.* How much do you want to spend, relative to the other traits you are trying to gain exposure to? Cheaper is not always better, neither is more expensive. * There are other aspects to deciding what "strike" but this serves as a starting point to help traders contextualize the decision.  **Common questions.**  1. Why not just buy far OTM options because they're cheaper, have lower theta decay, and the highest compounding return potential?    1. Because they require significant moves to make money. Even small moves in our favor may not yield a profit.    2. This approach is best suited when we have significant conviction in a significant move - not because they're cheap 2. Why not just sell far OTM options because they often expire OTM?    1. While this approach can work for extended periods of time, the severity when the directional move eventually occurs can be catastrophic (see James Cordier awful apology video following his blow up from shorting nat gas naked - it worked until it didn't [    2. This approach is best suited when we have strict risk control metrics to guard against large moves that quickly compound our losses and are collecting enough premium to make it a positively expectant strategy. Remember, uncommon moves are much more common in the markets that what we price in typically, we see this time and time again. Nassim Taleb talks about his at length. 3. So what strike is best?    1. Hopefully, you know there isn't a "best" one by now. To find the best strike for your hypothesis, at a high level it's a balance of directional movement potential, cost, and theta decay. Based on how you feel about each of those AND weight them, you will arrive at your answer.    2. E.g. I have long calls on in AAPL that I established back in 10May as part of my Ratio Call Diagonal strategy.       1. I selected a 140DTE expiration cycle to give the trade time to work, but balance cost       2. I chose a 0.80 delta long option, to maximize the dollar for dollar move, reduce theta decay, accepting a higher overall cost for those options.  Hope this gives traders some ideas on the flow of selecting strikes. It shouldn't be random and if we track our process, we can optimize it over time.,;,; 2023-06-30 22:03:22]

[Expected moves today, Powell, SPY, VIX,;,; Futures are lower for a 3rd straight day as the market waits for Fed Chair Powell's testimony in front of Congress. Some of his prepared remarks were released before the bell. The 3 day losing streak hasn't added up to much of a sell-off as of yet. The SPY is lower by about 1.5% since an intra-week high last Thursday. Nor has it affected vol much, the VIX is even lower than it was during that Thursday high in stocks.   As mentioned alot recently, yes vol is low, but the moves in the market are also very muted. The realized vol in SPY over the past month now sits at 12. Options in SPY are about 11 vol for the upcoming few weeks. In other words, IV is currently reflective of how the market is moving. Therefore option buyers are still having to get direction correct and be very nimble, despite how "cheap" vol is. Short-term option trading is basically a battle between implied vol, and realized vol. The mean reversion of IV (buying low IV, selling high IV) typically needs more time to play out. Speaking of that, when vol is this low for this long it's sometimes helpful to begin to look out a few months and see how low IV has been dragged down by what's happening recently. A look at SPY vol out in November and December shows at-the-money vol around 15-16. To put that in perspective, that's both below historical averages for IV, but it's also much lower than the realized vol if SPY over the past year, which is around 20, even with the slow grind of the past few months.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Action:**  * Tesla Inc (TSLA) +0.54% * Marathon Digital Hldgs Inc (MARA) +5.38% * Riot Platforms Inc (RIOT) +3.82% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +0.96% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.66% * Coinbase Global Inc Cl A (COIN) +2.89% * Opendoor Technologies Inc (OPEN) +4.23% * Alibaba Group Holding ADR (BABA) -0.65% * Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) +0.24% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.33% * Carvana Company Cl A (CVNA) +0.55% * Li Auto Inc ADR (LI) +3.14% * C3.Ai Inc Cl A (AI) -0.76%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * KB Home (KBH) Expected Move: 7.97% * Winnebago Industries, Inc.

[Expected moves, Tesla, Netflix, Intuitive Surgical, Capital One and more.,;,; * Futures lower.  * QQQ -0.70%, SPY -0.25%  * Tesla and Netflix are both lower, but both within the expected move (thus far)  One of the things to look for as earnings season heats up is whether companies that miss see buyers below. We're about to get a test of underlying strength in the market with both Netflix and Tesla are lower on earnings. The two companies were the first mega-cap tech stocks to report this cycle. And most mega-cap stocks rallied into earnings season. If these companies miss, and find buyers below, the stocks will stay above their expected move levels, indicating an underlying bid in these stocks, folks that may have missed some of this rally, and now see a chance to get in. Obviously support levels are interesting spots to watch, but the options market provides another consistent one, the expected move. If the stocks continue lower, and close the day below their expected move (into earnings) it may indicate some buyer exhaustion, with buyers unwilling to step in or defend levels that were expected on a miss.  &amp;#x200B;  **Chart of the Day:**  Often, expected moves line up with recent resistance and support.

[Expected moves this week. CPI, and earnings kick off with JP Morgan, Wells, Citi and more.,;,; Stocks finished lower last week, with the SPY down about 1%, just slightly more than with options were pricing for the holiday-shortened week. The bigger story for options was that implied vol did begin to pick up a bit. The VIX finished the week at about 15.50. That's up from the multi-year lows in the VIX the last week fo June that saw the index below 13. SPY weekly vol also saw a pick-up with the weeklies now 11-12 vol, up from 9-10 we saw with vol at its lows. Coming out of the holiday things stay interesting with economic data while earnings make a return to the scene. On the economic data front, things are a bit quiet the first two days of the week with a few FOMC member speeches on the docket. On Wednesday things pick up with the CPI release, followed on Thursday by the PPI, giving us a good update on inflation. Then on Friday we get a check on the consumer with the UoM consumer sentiment number. Also on Thursday into Friday the story quickly shifts to earnings as a couple of big reports kick off the new season. On Thursday we hear from Pepsi and Delta Airlines, but that's just the warm-up to Friday morning with reports from JPMorgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, Blackrock and more.

[Expected moves: Netflix, Tesla and more.,;,; The second round of big bank earnings are out with Bank of America, PNC and Morgan Stanley reporting this morning. The results have not been market-moving as of yet. MS is unched as of now, with BAC down slightly, both with moves less than options were pricing. PNC is down about 3% vs a 3.5% expected move. So the reactions are pretty muted all things considered. The broader market thinks the same, with futures all red but very slightly. Most of the bank stocks were lower over the past 3 months with the exception of JPM.

Throughout the entire sell-off things have been fairly orderly overall. And that is reflected in the fact that the VIX hasn't really gotten above 22, even recently. The 20 area in the VIX had been where the market had seen buyers step in over the past 9 months or so but not this time. Whether that gets resolved with a VIX spike closer to 30 soon or not remains to be seen but traders should be watching that for any sort or capitulation indication of at least this recent selling causing a little panic selling of stocks. 0DTE and weekly IV is certainly higher now with daily expected moves now regularly over 1%.

[Expected Moves, Docusign, Apple and more,;,; First, a couple of earnings moves from last night, GameStop is slightly higher well off its after-hours highs, and now well inside its expected move. UiPath in a very similar situation, slightly higher but off its post-earnings highs outside market hours and now well inside what options were pricing. On the flipside C3.ai Inc (AI)is down about 14%, slightly more than the 12.5% move options were pricing. The big story since late yesterday is AAPL's quick plunge following reports that the Chinese government is extending the prohibition of Apple‚Äôs iPhones. Apple is down more than 7% since yesterday afternoon.  To put that move in perspective, Apple options were not pricing a 7%+ move until late November. In fact, the recent chart in Apple looks a bit detached from current low IV in the options in general, with the stock having just made 7%+ moves several times since late July:  &amp;#x200B;    Apple vol is low historically, with 30-day IV about 23, while the past year's realized vol has been 29. The assumption often with a mega-cap stock like AAPL is that while bouts of volatility happen, the stock will reset to a grind higher at some point with low realized and implied vol. But AAPL has been moving for the past month and change in ways that options continue to underprice.  Docusign is the big earnings after the bell. Options are pricing about a 9% move at the moment.

[Earnings expected moves, Amazon, Apple, Coinbase, Draftkings and more.,;,; A couple of giants report after the close, amidst a heavy earnings calendar. On the economic front, we get the NFP jobs number tomorrow morning.  Here's a preview of Amazon and the options setup, which can be a good sense of the overall set-up into an earnings event. The expected move is about 6%. That compares to the most recent earnings moves of -4%, -8%, -7% and +10%. So today's expected move is just shy of the mid of the past 4 earnings moves with the most recent earnings having moved less (-4%).   The IV of the weeklies is about 100. That compares to the 30 day IV of about 43. Of course, the weekly options expire tomorrow, so really they should be thought of as an expected move, and less so as vega. That 30 day IV (44), which is a purer representation of vega, is higher than the 30 day realized vol (how the stock has actually moved over the past 30 days) of just 27. Amazon's realized vol over the past month is quite quiet compared to how its moved over the past year, with its yearly realized vol being 39.   That paints a picture of very high IV compared to the stock's very recent history, but options priced for earnings that are leaning towards a move slightly less than the stock has moved over the past year on earnings. This comes in an overall lower IV and realized vol environment over the past few months.  An Iron Condor, set at the expected move, and $1 wide on the wings, would need AMZN to stay within about 120.50 and 136.50. The bullish expected move lines up very near to the highs of 2023 in the stock, which happened within the past month. Here's how that looks on the chart.  &amp;#x200B;    Apple's expected move of 3% compares to earnings moves over the past year of +5%, +3%, +8% and +3%. Again, low IV compared to earnings over the past year, but AAPL's realized vol over the past month is just 13! Options buyers have not been doing well in those conditions and the low IV into earnings is a reflection of that suffering. 3% is about $6 in either direction.  Here's some other highlights today:  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**    **Early Movers:**  * Amer Superconductor (AMSC) -21.5% * Paypal Holdings (PYPL) -7.9% * Qualcomm Inc (QCOM) -8.9% * Moderna Inc (MRNA) +2.0% * Robinhood Markets Inc Cl A (HOOD) -4.7%  **Economic Calendar:**  * At 10:00 AM (EST) ISM Services PMI (Jul) Estimates: 53, Prior: 53.9  **Scanner Highlights:**  * **Overbought (RSI):** OSTK (77), JWN (75), IBM (74), KSS (71) * **Oversold (RSI):** HON (31), LUV (40), EBAY (41), TXN (41), MCD (41), SNOW (41), BUD (41) * **High IV:** NKLA (+198%), SAVE (+158%), PYPL (+142%), BUD (+142%), PLTR (+140%) * **Unusual Options Volume:** RAD (+1928%), TRIP (+798%), AMD (+773%), SHOP (+771%), CAT (+611%), QCOM (+563%), MTCH (+551%), NVDA (+494%), MSTR (+408%), PYPL (+402%), MRNA (+398%)  Full lists here: [Options AI Free Tools](  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-08-03 12:46:54]
[Expected moves, NFP jobs, SPY, VIX Apple and more.,;,; Non Farm Payrolls drop at 8:30 ET and suddenly take on new significance after the market reaction yesterday to ADP employment data. As pointed out in this space a few times recently, stocks have largely ignored rising treasury yields (higher interest rate assumptions) over the past few months as the fears of a bad recession faded a little. But with recent strong data and hawkish words from the Fed, yields have plowed higher and traders showed some concern for the first time in a while the past 2 days. The 1-year yield is now at its highest level since 2000, the 2yr traded yesterday at its highest level since 2006 and the 10yr is at its highest level since 2007. Where yields go next are likely to affect the market's next moves and the NFP this morning will be the last data point in a slew of news we received in the second part of this week. The VIX got as high as 17 yesterday, indicating some renewed interest in option buying. It pulled back a bit late and is now 15.80. But this is the first bit of life option buyers have shown in months. Futures are basically unchanged into the NFP print.

[Expected Moves this Week: SPY, QQQ, Nvidia, Apple, Costco, Nike, Micron and more.,;,; Last week saw a pop in volatility and several down days following the FOMC announcement. SPY finished the week down 2.9%, nearly 3x the move options were pricing. The VIX closed on Thursday Sept 14th below 13, into a Sept 15th triple witching expiry that saw the expiration of alot of gamma that may have been keeping a lid on market volatility while some bad news piled up. Once that gamma got unwound/expired implied vol began ticking up into the FOMC meeting and then even higher with stocks going lower out of the meeting.   The VIX is now above 17, still slightly below its historical mean but now matching its highest levels since late May. In other words, the low vol, slow grind higher we saw over the entire summer looks to have come to an end, at least for now, with September expiration. Keep an eye on both weekly IV as well as 30-60 day IV as both got very low into that Sept 15th expiry. Stocks that had seen a slow grind higher all Summer were suddenly making large moves in the span of days or weeks that options weren't pricing to happen in the span of multiple months in the future.   For traders, it's helpful to look at recent stock moves and compare to the expected move in the future to see instinctually if options are inexpensive out in the future. Just as an example, NVDA has made several 15% moves in the past month, yet options are not pricing that sort of move to happen again until December expiry:    And Apple has made several moves in the 8-10% range recently, yet options aren't pricing a 10% move until well into the beginning of 2024:       There's no guarantee the volatility will continue, it could stop on a dime again. But, options clearly are still in a hangover from the low vol days of Summer and are still playing catch-up. The weeklies have made the biggest spike so far, now pricing in expected moves about 50% higher than just a few weeks ago. Here's this week's look:  * **SPY expected move this week: 1.5%** * **QQQ expected move this week: 1.9%**  &amp;#x200B;  **Earnings This Week**   *Tuesday*  * **COST** Costco **3.0%** * **CTAS** Cintas Corporation **4.5%** * **FERG** Ferguson plc **5.4%** * **SNX** TD SYNNEX Corporation **6.0%**  *Wednesday*  * **MU** Micron Technology, Inc. **5.3%** * **PAYX** Paychex, Inc. **4.5%** * **CNXC** Concentrix Corporation **9.0%**  *Thursday*  * **NKE** NIKE, Inc. **5.2%** * **KMX** CarMax, Inc. **8.2%** * **BB** BlackBerry Limited **8.8%**  *Friday*  * **CCL** Carnival Cruise Lines **8.3%**  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-09-24 17:04:37]

[Long Dated Covered Call: Sound Strategy?,;,; I own Apple stock at 185, and sold an AAPL 230 Jun 2025 covered call, collecting ~$1150 in premium.

[Is now a stupid time to buy leaps?,;,; I'm highly bullish on stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Meta and was thinking of buying a deep in the money leap with around a 0.8 to 0.9 delta with 1 or 2 years until expiration, and potentially selling 2 month from expiration calls against them. However, given the uncertainty in the market, I was wondering if this would be a foolish strategy to do right now and if I should consider something else/wait later for better prices.  The reason for me doing leaps is because I am long term bullish on these stocks and would like to potentially collect premium without having to spend the full amount of money of 100 shares, and also to magnify my gains  edit: probably going to go with a pmcc on Meta. Even the current price is good imo and they are sleeping giant in Generative AI,;,; 2023-05-20 21:33:46]

[A picture is worth a thousand strikes,;,; I have attempted to visualize an Options chain.  So much information gets lost in numbers when not presented as a visual.  For instance, apple has on average 15 expiry dates and for each expiry date (for calls and puts) there are at least 20 useful metrics (such as greeks, prices, and implied volatility levels). Hard for humans to digest this information.  In this visual, I have encoded implied volatility as slanted arrows, with the length matching the Implied volatility. I felt static visual is good enough. The animated version is pleasing to the eye but does not add much additional value.  The bid-ask spread and the labeling makes it easier to interpret. Even Encoding volume as an arrow makes it interesting to learn about which strikes are actively traded. With simple annotations such as option price = Stock price - Strike makes it welcoming to options beginners.  What else can we add/ remove?  If you want to, send me your ticker, and I will make a visual for you.  &amp;#x200B;   2023-08-19 13:29:46]

[Selling covered calls,;,; Hello, got a question about selling covered calls. I‚Äôm pretty new to covered calls. I just want to get some extra money by selling covered calls of spy. I do have 100 shares of spy. My question is what is your strategy when it comes to selling covered calls for spy? Do you sell covered call everyday since spy allows you do that. Or weekly covered calls? Another question is it a good idea to sell covered calls around big earnings such as apple, meta and so on‚Ä¶or do you sell calls before and after the earnings since the market is extremely unpredictable during that time.

[The only thing PDT rule protects is fat cats from having to share their profits.,;,; I've been trading for about 6 months now. In that time, I've saved up my weekly trades to use at one time during the week to practice day trading. In between I do some swing trading and a few long term contracts. The VAST majority of my losses are from contracts held for longer than the trading day. Moreover, I see so many profit opportunities throughout the day that I just can't take because of the stupid PDT rule. Today I was watching Apple all day bounce back and forth between about 178-179ish and wanting sooo badly to scalp some contracts. Or QQQ dropping into the 353s and wanting to buy some calls. NOPE PDT rule. What exactly are they claiming to protect people from? Forcing people to keep positions open just because their account value is relatively small is just predatory IMO. Yea, I could just trade equities, but I'm already doing that for retirement. I want to generate income from trading and PDT is just making it harder. In fact, if it weren't for the day trades I have done, I would be at a net loss right now from my initial account balance. Futures are also not an option for me. I use TD Ameritrade and the fees are just way too high for futures. If I could trade the full /ES and not /MES, then yea, but then again, the margin requirement is too high for my account right now.,;,; 2023-06-06 21:37:47]

[Short Strangles on Futures,;,; I am pretty new to the study of options, but have been enjoying the learning.  Reading different posts here, trying different options screeners, YouTube videos, etc.  I have found a few good educators on YT ‚Äì Tom King is one of them.  I have been playing around with his 1-1-1 and 1-1-2 strategies (on paper only).  The way he presents short strangles on futures options is pretty intriguing.  90 DTE; sell a 7% delta Put and sell a 6% delta Call.  Take profit at 50%; stop loss at 3x premium collected.  He suggests that often he will hit the 50% profit mark at around 30 days after purchase.  Of course, I get POP% numbers that are very high (90-92%) which I guess should be expected given the low deltas.   Mr. King says he focuses on options on futures of gold, oil, ES, Aud$, and a few others.  I modelled those and several others to see how they compared.  Since all of the scenarios have similar DTEs, the same deltas on the Puts and Calls, same profit % target, same Stop Loss, it feels like they are set up to be pretty much apples to apples.   As a result, I have been looking at (premium collected) / (margin required), annualized, to get something like a return on invested capital as a way to evaluate different the underlying.  Interestingly, the top return on investment products are (in declining order): sugar, lean hogs, coffee, soybeans, and crude oil. Is there an obvious reason that these would generate the highest annual percentage return?   It seems like IV and/or IV Percentile would be logical variables to consider.  All other things being equal, high volatility that is starting to fall should be a better sell candidate than a future with low volatility that is starting to rise.  I thought I could use the CVOL for this.  OI varies a lot, but it does not seem to be so dramatic as to be an important consideration.   But, as I said, I am still really new to this strategy and would appreciate knowing what metrics and parameters you would look at.  This is all on paper/spreadsheets, just to educate myself.   Thanks in advance for any thoughts you would like to share.,;,; 2024-01-29 01:00:46]

[LEAPS strategy for anticipated bear market?,;,; Hey everyone,  I wouldn't say I'm new to investing or trading, as I'm well aware of the basics, but I'm looking for advice on a strategy that is still missing a few details.  I'm bearish on the market writ large over the next 12-18 months for a broad base of reasons including sustained inflation/interest rates, CRE difficulty, reduced rate of lending, regular and student loan debt, etc. Through my research, I've found that LEAPS are a strong move for a long term trend, as theta decay is less extreme for options with lots of time to expiration.   I was considering buying long term, deep OTM (15%+) puts, but I'm not sure of the specifics. In this case, is it better to buy puts on something like SPY, or would this sort of play work better on a large enough individual stock like the Big 3 automotive or Apple?

[Help me decide on the best options to get for max profit.,;,; Fellow options enthusiasts.  Need to pick your cumulative brains to figure out what my best bet is for the following scenario:  I have $6000 to play with.  I believe Apple has a solid short opportunity here. There is a possibility that we break above $200, but it will still highly likely reverse from there.  I am looking at a short target of $165-$160, apx 5-6 months from now.  What is the best option strategy for me that will not kill me on time decay and generally go in my favor. I also would like the strike price to be OTM to take advantage of the discount for OTM strikes, I don‚Äôt believe buying options ITM is in my benefit. But I‚Äôm happy to hear your thoughts.

[Covered Call - Worth it?,;,; Hi all, I am new to options and have been thinking about the idea of earning some income off of my current stocks. I have a few hundred stocks in Apple, Google and Amazon and have been investing into them for a while. I am up anywhere from 30-110% in unrealized gains.   I started looking at selling covered calls on these stocks using a common strategy that I‚Äôve found online: sell calls out of the money about 30-45 days out with a low delta &lt;0.2 ish and collect the premium - hoping they expire worthless.   My problem is that I do not want to part from the stocks just yet. I looked into strategies of rolling calls up and out so I avoid having them assigned. My question is: Is this a sound strategy?

[Book recommendations,;,; Hey there. I'm starting to learn a bit. My goal is to try and make relatively small trades with a high likelihood of profitability and limited risk/reward with the understanding that obviously I'll lose some capital also. Ideally over time I can on average bring in a bit of extra income. Not looking to get rich quick or quit my job.  I'm looking to learn from a respectable source some strategies to look into, to start small. Unfortunately the internet is a cesspool of misinformation. I just saw a guy recommending people naked short puts of apple stock with like $100k referring to the premium as "a dividend". Even as absolute novice this seems like a good way to be in debt a massive amount of money very quickly, if your broker even allowed you to take up such a risky position. It kinda filled me with rage, that this was being passed off as advice to "live off dividends with very little investment capital".  Anyway. I would appreciate any recommendations for some level-headed reality based information that's geared toward entry level. I've looked through the wiki, and am working my way through some links. I am just curious if anyone has a favourite resource that maybe isn't listed. Thanks.  Update: want to thank everybody for their notes, I appreciate it.,;,; 2023-11-07 14:45:14]

[Monte Carlo methods for optimizing covered call strategy,;,; Hey everyone. A little background on me, I do software with some math at my day job, and passively invest. I am an extremely conservative investor, I just buy some VOO every week.   But occasionally I like to do some "risky" trades, in 2021 I wrote a little program to help me backtest blue chip stocks against their historical DCF valuations using old 10-K data, just for fun. Then in 2022 I used it to help pick some blue chip tech stocks. I figured while the tech sector was being beaten down, I would try to see if there were any bargains and I ended up picking up some Google and Apple for a decent discount of like \~30%  Now, obviously I don't expect that to happen again. That was just me experimenting and getting very lucky. But I'd like to be slightly more active now by writing covered calls on SPY. The problem is, I can't find any good sources on using math for optimizing call strategies, specifically for covered calls.  There are lots of good layperson-readable sources for valuation (Aswath Damodaran) and Modern Portfolio Theory, but I can't find anything like that for options.   I am really looking for something that can be plugged into a Monte Carlo simulation and show me a graph that I can use to figure out the strike price and expiration date that fits within my risk tolerance.   Basically I'd like to say "hey I'd like to make 2-3% more per year on top of my buy-and-hold strategy, but only have a 5-10% risk of actually having to sell in a given year", then consult with the output of some algorithm to see if that's reasonable.,;,; 2023-10-11 23:25:28]

[Examples Of Comparing Interest Rates With Different Compounding Intervals,;,;    ## Simple Interestüì∑  If you pay someone $90 today and they promise to give you $100 in 12 months, you are making a loan. This is the same idea as buying a bond. To back out the *simple* interest rate denoted (ie assuming no compounding) we solve for r:  90 \* (1+r) = 100  r = 100/90 ‚Äì 1  r = 11.11%  **Annualizing**  If the loan was only for 6 months, then we‚Äôd annualize the interest rate by multiplying by 2 (12 months / 6 months) for a rate of 22.22%  ## Compound Interestüì∑  Let‚Äôs return to the 12-month loan and say that the rate is compounded semi-annually. Then the computation is:  90 \* (1+r/2)¬≤ = 100  r /2 = (100/90).5 ‚Äì 1  r = 10.82%  If you compound more frequently than annually, it makes sense that the implied interest rate is lower. Consider the path of the principal + accrued interest:  üì∑  Compounding semi-annually means interest gets credited at the 6-month mark. So the rate for the next 6 months is being applied to the higher accrued value amount which means the implied rate to end up at $100 (the same way the simple interest case ends up $100) must be lower than the simple interest case.  ## Continuous Interestüì∑  We can compound interest more frequently. Quarterly, monthly, daily. Since the number we are backing out, namely the implied rate, is being applied to a growing basket of principal + accrued interest at each checkpoint (I think of the compounding interval as a checkpoint where the accrued interest is rolled into the remaining loan balance), the implied rate to end up at $100 must be smaller. If we take this logic to the extreme and keep cutting the time interval into smaller increments we eventually hit the limit of Œît ‚Üí 0. The derivatives world models everything in continuous time finance so interest rates get the same treatment.  Mechanically, the math is no harder.  To compute the continuously compounded interest rate we still just solve for r:  90 \* ert = 100  t is a fraction of a year. So for the 12-month case:  90 \* er\*1 = 100  er = 100/90  r ln(e) = ln(100/90)  r = 10.54%  As expected, this is a lower implied rate than the 11.11% simple rate and the 10.82% semi-annual rate. Again, because we are compounding continuously.  Annualizing remains easy. If $90 grows to $100 in just 6 months, we compute the continuously compounded rate as follow:  90 \* er\*1/2 = 100  er\*1/2 = 100/90  r \*1/2 = ln(100/90)  r = 21.07%  This can be contrasted with the 22.22% 6-month loan using simple interest we computed earlier.  ## Application To Real Lifeüì∑  Note in all these cases, $90 is growing to $100. We are just seeing that the implied rate depends on the compounding assumption. In real life, when you see ‚Äúcompounded daily‚Äù or ‚Äúcompounded monthly‚Äù and so on, you are now equipped with the tools to compare rates on an apples-to-apples basis. If a rate is lower but compounds more frequently than another rate the relative value between both loans is ambiguous.  APYs disclosed on financial products make yields comparable. But now you understand how APYs convert different rate schedules into a single measure.,;,; 2023-06-27 13:07:55]
[Next steps - playing Mega-techs / Spy,;,; I played NVDA when it hit it's high, made about 30,000 on puts, and turned that around and played spy down through mega-tech earnings. Ended up with just under 100,000. Lost some in the last couple of days... I knew that spy was going to rebound over the 200 MA and still screwed up. I'm using trading view along with lux algo and, although helpful, I don't feel like I know enough about either (just started using them) to really make the best use of them... I have 4 years of solid experience, trading almost daily, I've had great ups and stupid downs, and now I've been trying to be much more precise and make constant gains. Up through the reversal back up over the last 2 days I had had 3 straight weeks of gains (200 - 210%), but I'm not sure where to go from here. My TA says Spy should drop but interest rates may drop, don't know where we are going in the short-term for a number of reasons, and I try not to play expensive premium options, when possible. I trade on extrinsic value (when I'm ITM). Outside of Apple's earnings, which I personally think will be bearish, I'm feeling a bit burnt out and like I need to tap a new vein of the market. I know this is a broud post with no real direction, but I would love some feedback on some ideas of how to continue my upward momentum. I don't want to get hyperfixate (as I usually do, super ADD) and play Spy as it trades sideways / up, in the short-term. I could just sit on my hands... Im long (20 years) on 40,000 shares of Goog A/C (26k / 14k)  that I could write covered calls / puts on, but, honestly, haven't done that before, and, there are some other financial considerations I'd have to think about. I know there are other assets/commodities/etc to play out there, but I would love to hear any feedback on which areas of the market to turn to next / opinions on TV/LA learning curve, usage, and all the other things I mentioned in my little post. Happy Halloween everyone.,;,; 2023-11-01 01:04:28]
[Expected moves this week: Bank of America, Goldman, Netflix, Tesla and more.,;,; SPY was higher by 2.5% last week. A much larger move than options were pricing. Vol remains low across the board. To start this week the futures are pulling back a bit and with that, the VIX is starting the week off around 14 (the historical mean is around 19). This is the first full week of earnings season. Tomorrow we get a second round of big bank reports when we hear from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley (Goldman is a day later) as well as a look into online brokerage with Schwab and Interactive Brokers. On Wednesday two of the popular trading names take center stage with both Tesla and Netflix reporting after the close. We also hear from more airlines like United and get an early look at the chip sector with Taiwan Semi on Thursday. And finally a look at consumer credit and spending with American Express on Friday.  A pretty packed Tuesday through Friday so make sure to check the calendar each day. Next week things heat up even more with some mega-cap tech. On the economic front this week is lighter than the past few. We get a speech today from ECB president Lagarde, retail sales on Tuesday, and then housing data and initial jobless claims later in the week. Some expected moves for notable earnings this week.

[The Indicators You Should Be Using,;,;    ## If anyone is trying to sell you an indicator but can't explain exactly what it does or why it works, it's probably junk.   Many traders see technical indicators and try to apply them to every stock they see. On the other hand, professional traders focus on finding an edge ‚Äî a reason why an option or stock might be undervalued or overvalued. Only after they find an edge do they use indicators to determine when the edge exists.   Take Bollinger bands as an example. Bollinger bands show the X standard deviations from the stock price. It's just a math equation using historical, public data. Applying Bollinger bands to the S&amp;P500 (an index with essentially random price movements) won't get you anywhere. At any given time, the S&amp;P 500 is just as likely to go up as down.  # So When Might Bollinger Bands Work?  A pair trade using Bollinger bands could work.   Imagine the ratio between two similar stocks (such as Apple and Microsoft) is fairly constant. Because these companies are fairly similar, you can expect them to move in tandem.   After using statistics to verify the relationships between stock prices are mean-reverting, you could plot Bollinger bands around the ratio of the stock prices. You could use that to determine when one stock is too expensive relative to the other. If the AAPL/MSFT price ratio rose suddenly and touched the Bollinger Band, we could sell AAPL and buy MSFT with the expectation that their relative prices will revert back towards the mean.   This trade works because similar assets should trade at similar prices. Sometimes there is just a little more demand for AAPL than MSFT from institutional funds, and prices diverge a little. However, because the fundamentals of both companies remain the same, prices should converge as demand subsides.   **Mindlessly applying an RSI indicator, MACD, or moving average isn't going to get you anywhere.**   If they really worked, nobody would sell stock during bullish signals. Nobody would buy stock during bearish signals. Everyone can see the same indicators you do. If they worked, you wouldn't be able to make profitable trades.  Many signal groups or other paid services advertise their indicators as the next big thing, perhaps utilizing some fancy form of machine learning algorithm or artificial intelligence. However, there's so much noise in the market that it's easy to look like you found something, even though it's not really there.   # Trading indicators should be built around an idea. They shouldn't be the idea itself.  Good luck, and happy trading!,;,; 2023-03-23 16:50:30]
[Expected moves today, Powell, SPY, VIX,;,; Futures are lower for a 3rd straight day as the market waits for Fed Chair Powell's testimony in front of Congress. Some of his prepared remarks were released before the bell. The 3 day losing streak hasn't added up to much of a sell-off as of yet. The SPY is lower by about 1.5% since an intra-week high last Thursday. Nor has it affected vol much, the VIX is even lower than it was during that Thursday high in stocks.   As mentioned alot recently, yes vol is low, but the moves in the market are also very muted. The realized vol in SPY over the past month now sits at 12. Options in SPY are about 11 vol for the upcoming few weeks. In other words, IV is currently reflective of how the market is moving. Therefore option buyers are still having to get direction correct and be very nimble, despite how "cheap" vol is. Short-term option trading is basically a battle between implied vol, and realized vol. The mean reversion of IV (buying low IV, selling high IV) typically needs more time to play out. Speaking of that, when vol is this low for this long it's sometimes helpful to begin to look out a few months and see how low IV has been dragged down by what's happening recently. A look at SPY vol out in November and December shows at-the-money vol around 15-16. To put that in perspective, that's both below historical averages for IV, but it's also much lower than the realized vol if SPY over the past year, which is around 20, even with the slow grind of the past few months.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Action:**  * Tesla Inc (TSLA) +0.54% * Marathon Digital Hldgs Inc (MARA) +5.38% * Riot Platforms Inc (RIOT) +3.82% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +0.96% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.66% * Coinbase Global Inc Cl A (COIN) +2.89% * Opendoor Technologies Inc (OPEN) +4.23% * Alibaba Group Holding ADR (BABA) -0.65% * Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) +0.24% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.33% * Carvana Company Cl A (CVNA) +0.55% * Li Auto Inc ADR (LI) +3.14% * C3.Ai Inc Cl A (AI) -0.76%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * KB Home (KBH) Expected Move: 7.97% * Winnebago Industries, Inc.

[Expensive Options Case Study: TSM,;,; TSM seems like a great stock to sell options on. Because implied volatility is so high, we'll make a ton of theta while the stock remains relatively calm.   This simple trade will make around 1% in a month. Here is my research:  ## What is TSMC?  TSMC is a semiconductor manufacturing company with huge companies such as AMD, Apple, NVIDIA, and more as its clients. Here‚Äôs how the stock has been moving recently:    While the stock made an impressive run at the beginning of the year, it‚Äôs calmed down a bit. The stock has stayed around the $90-ish mark, ranging from roughly $85 to $95.  The implied volatility of TSM has been high for the last several months. The current implied vol is 27.51, but the realized vol is around 25.03.    We can see that there‚Äôs been a significant premium, and even though the spread is gradually closing, implied volatility remains above realized volatility. Options sellers are winning here since theta is eating away at too much of the options' value compared to the gamma they have to put up with.   Of course, we're not supposed to directly compare implied volatility (a forward-looking figure) to historical realized volatility. However, we can use historical data to try and forecast future volatility three different ways:  ## Predicting Alpha Volatility Forecast  The Predicting Alpha terminal forecasts volatility using a blend of IVs and RVs. This is a quick and easy way for volatility traders to understand where implied volatility should be trading. For TSM, the PA forecast is¬†**22.69%.**  ## Realized Volatility  Another estimate for future volatility is simply using the 30-day realized volatility. Since volatility tends to cluster, historical volatility tends to be a good estimator of future volatility. The 30-day window ensures we have enough data without using old, irrelevant data. For TSM, the 30D realized volatility is¬†**25.03%.**  ## Implied Volatility  Since implied volatility is the market‚Äôs expectation of future volatility, implied volatility can be a good predictor of future volatility. Implied volatility tends to be just a tad higher than realized, though, because of the variance risk premium. This is the case with TSM; on average, IV is about 1.06x RV:       By removing the variance risk premium from implied volatility, we can find our third forecast of volatility:¬†**25.9%.**  ## Forecast of Volatility  By taking an average of our three estimates, we have an average of 24.54%. Compared to our current 27.51 vol, that‚Äôs a 3-point difference!  The market price of the $92 June monthly straddle is around 5.28, but at a 24.54 vol, the straddle should be only worth 4.71. By selling the straddle, we make about $57 monthly on less than $5000 in margin.  ## Position Sizing and Management.  As for position management, I would continue to hold this trade if TSM happens to be less volatile than implied. If we start to see multiple days in a row of outsized moves, I will cut the position early, even at a loss. Of course, if implied volatility drops, we can get out once the edge is gone.  ## Conclusion  This is just one of many trades that should be a part of a short-vol book. The research is solid, but the edge isn‚Äôt enough to YOLO our life savings.  Trade it small; find many similar trades to spread your risk!  Good luck, and happy trading.,;,; 2023-05-23 16:29:10]
[Expected Moves this week, SPY, VIX, QQQ, MU and more.,;,; SPY was lower last week by about 0.6%, again, inside what options were pricing. Implied vol closed extremely low into the weekend, with SPY some at-the-money SPY weekly options sporting single-digit handles. That IV should reset a bit higher out of the weekend but overall vol remains historically below average and at multi-year lows. The VIX closed last week below 13.50. Of course, vol could always go lower, but it's getting to the point where those lower moves would be quite small. In general the 12-13 range in the VIX floor over the past 5 years and only on rare occasions over longer time horizons do you see it closer to 10. That's not to say it can't remain this low for a long time, but it can't get much lower. One thing to note from the past 2 weeks, the daily realized moves of the market versus what 0DTE options had been pricing has started to tip a bit in the favor of the market moves over the expected moves, particularly in the QQQ. That kind of action tends to put a floor on IV as well as option trading in same-day expiry is heavy volume and being more or less re-priced each day based on the prior day's result. Futures are flat to lower to start off the week.  This past weekend included some political chaos in Russia but markets this week will most likely concentrate on a combo of economic data like GDP &amp; Durable Goods and speeches by Lagarde (tues) and Powell (wed, thurs). SPY options are pricing about a 1.1% move for the week at 10 vol (at the money) although that could get a lift on the open. The earnings calendar this week is slow but steady, with Micron (MU) a highlight on Wednesday.  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Actives:**  * Lucid Group Inc (LCID) +7.86% * Tesla Inc (TSLA) -2.27% * Trxade Health Inc (MEDS) +60.43% * Eco Wave Power Global Ab ADR (WAVE) +22.11% * Marathon Digital Hldgs Inc (MARA) -3.30% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.19% * Alphabet Cl A (GOOGL) -1.65% * Nvidia Corp (NVDA) -0.33% * Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) +0.11% * Coinbase Global Inc Cl A (COIN) -1.84%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**  * Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (CCL) Expected Move: 9.75% * Carnival Corporation &amp; plc (CUK) Expected Move: 13.06%  Full list here: [Options AI Earnings Calendar](  &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar:**  * At 10:30 AM (EST) Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index (Jun) Estimates: -26.5, Prior: -29.1  &amp;#x200B;  **Scanner Highlights:**  * Overbought (RSI): CCL (79), META (78), KMX (73), JNJ (72), ADBE (72), LLY (71), AAPL (70) * Oversold (RSI): OXY (31), PENN (31), DOCU (35), CHPT (36), MRNA (36), GS (36) * High IV: MANU (+212%), ATVI (+194%), VMW (+167%), NKE (+107%), AZN (+105%), IBM (+105%), TSLA (+103%) * Unusual Options Volume: KMX (+981%), MARA (+510%), COIN (+468%), SNAP (+416%), CCL (+343%), META (+310%), MSTR (+309%)  &amp;#x200B;  **Chart of the Day**  Some SPY options have seen IV marks below 10 recently.   2023-06-26 11:09:21]
[Expected moves this week. CPI, and earnings kick off with JP Morgan, Wells, Citi and more.,;,; Stocks finished lower last week, with the SPY down about 1%, just slightly more than with options were pricing for the holiday-shortened week. The bigger story for options was that implied vol did begin to pick up a bit. The VIX finished the week at about 15.50. That's up from the multi-year lows in the VIX the last week fo June that saw the index below 13. SPY weekly vol also saw a pick-up with the weeklies now 11-12 vol, up from 9-10 we saw with vol at its lows. Coming out of the holiday things stay interesting with economic data while earnings make a return to the scene. On the economic data front, things are a bit quiet the first two days of the week with a few FOMC member speeches on the docket. On Wednesday things pick up with the CPI release, followed on Thursday by the PPI, giving us a good update on inflation. Then on Friday we get a check on the consumer with the UoM consumer sentiment number. Also on Thursday into Friday the story quickly shifts to earnings as a couple of big reports kick off the new season. On Thursday we hear from Pepsi and Delta Airlines, but that's just the warm-up to Friday morning with reports from JPMorgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, Blackrock and more. Earnings announcements will come in fast and furious over the next several weeks.  &amp;#x200B;  * Today's SPY expected move (0DTE): **0.4%** * Today's QQQ expected move (0DTE): **0.6%**  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market Movers:**  * Mobilicom Limited ADR (MOB) +74.00% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +3.44% * Nanobiotix S.A.

[Expected Moves this Week: Low IV into NFP and an Earnings Lull, SPY, QQQ, IWM and more.,;,; ## Market View  **Last Week ‚Äì Another positive week and an IV collapse.**  SPY was up 3.5% last week, a move much larger than options were pricing. But because the move was to the upside, and came on the heels of some relieving bank headlines, implied vol collapsed. The VIX is now within a point of its lowest levels of 2023 and is down from 26 to 18.70 since the SVB drama, and actually at or below its historical mean. IV for SPY options expiring this week are in the 10-13 IV range, down significantly from the weekly IV near 30 we saw into the CPI and FOMC in March. There is a slight uptick in SPY IV into the next CPI April 12th, but only to 16 IV at the moment.  **This Week ‚Äì A Jobs Report, but on a holiday.**  SPY options are pricing about a 1.2% move for the 4 day week. This is a holiday week in the second half with Passover beginning Wednesday night and then markets closed for Good Friday. There will be some focus on the NFP release on Friday as market participants are now on the lookout for any signs of recession but the reaction will not come until the following Monday. Stock valuations are on the high side historically after the recent recovery in the market and the set-up into earnings season later this month isn‚Äôt necessarily pricing in the effects of a possible recession. So any signs of cracks on the economic front will be a focus. However, the bull case is that if the Fed is indeed winding down rate hikes and if inflation continues to moderate, the economy may have escaped the worst possible scenario. The NFP this week, CPI on the 12th, and the first 2 weeks of earnings reports in late April should give some clues.  Last week we highlighted the rapid IV decline in The Russell 2000. Options in IWM were pricing in a 5-day move of 4% two weeks ago, 2.7% last week, and this week just 1.8% (4 day week). So the options market is now pricing in much more typical moves in small-cap stocks than in the midst of the banking turmoil. Below is the IWM chart showing the large recent moves and the much smaller expected move now as a result of a collapse in IV (with this Friday highlighted):  &amp;#x200B;    **Expected Moves for This Week**¬†([via Options AI‚Äôs free tools](  * SPY¬†**1.2%** * QQQ **1.6%**¬† * IWM¬†**1.8%**  * DIA¬†**1.1%**   &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar**  * Monday ‚Äì **ISM Manufacturing** * Tuesday ‚Äì **ADP Employment, ISM Services** * Friday ‚Äì **Non-Farm Payrolls (markets closed)**  &amp;#x200B;  **Unusual Option Volume Friday**  * **HAS, AI, BB, SNOW, TSLA, UPST, UBS, ARKK, CLOV, DDOG, QQQ, SPY**  &amp;#x200B;  ## Earnings This Week  Via the Expected move, weekly IV, and prior earnings moves (starting with most recent).

[Expected moves, Core PCE, SPY, QQQ,;,; Futures are higher this morning. The market still has to digest the Fed's preferred inflation measure of core PCE which drops before the open. It's been a positive week for SPY, up about 1.1% coming into this morning (not counting the futures being higher). That's about in line with the move options were pricing for the week, so a positive day today would take stocks beyond what options had priced. That slow grind in a low-vol environment can be frustrating for option sellers as upside calls are really cheap and really close to the money when a trade is entered... so trade management on a slow creep higher is important.

[FOMC Rate Decision (March 22, 2023) - Which Way Is The Market Headed? (SPX/SPY),;,;    *On Wednesday, March 22, tomorrow (2:00PM EST), the Federal Reserve officials will convene and make a decision on interest rate. Usually, this comes with a lot of volatility in the market and presents opportunity for traders and investors alike. The purpose of this exercise is to try and predict the market direction and benefit from such a move.*   &amp;#x200B;  [Fed Chairman - Powell](   Last week I released a report on the latest CPI data (inflation), and how we could play that. See here ([ ). This current article is a sort of continuation of that report.   &amp;#x200B;   **What is this FOMC all about, and why is this important?**      The Federal Open Market Committee, under the Federal Reserve, is responsible for open market operations. This is to say that part of the job of the Federal Reserve is to influence the availability and cost of money and credit. Essentially, for our purpose, they hold the rein on interest rates. And Changes in interest rates affect a lot of things - stock market, mortgage, prices of goods, foreign exchange rates, long term interest rates, etc.     In our last article, we noted from the CPI data that inflation is quite hot at 6% (Year-Over-Year). Things are expensive, and this is where FOMC comes in. The banking crisis we just witnessed couple days ago is also as a result of rate hikes. So, is this important? Yes, it is.          [Meeting schedule FOMC March 22, 2023](     **Rate Hike (Consensus): By How Much Will They Raise Rates?**     On March 22, it is expected that rates will go up by 0.25% pts. This is what most market participants expect. Some expect 0.50% and some other expect no rates increase at all.      However, we have seen, from past rate decisions, how volatile days like this could be. Take a look of the last rate hike on Feb 1st 2023.    &amp;#x200B;  [Illustration 1 - SPX 5M \(FOMC, Feb 1, 2023\)](   **The question now is, come tomorrow, how will the market react to the decision, and what way is the SPY/SPX headed - up or down?**     We have to take a look at the chart first. Here is SPY daily chart.    &amp;#x200B;  [Illustration 2- SPY Daily \(Pre-FOMC, March 22, 2023\)](   *Can you see the story that this chart tells? It tells an interesting story, doesn't it?*      Here is what the chart says:     From point \[1\] on chart, starting March 13, we can see that SPY has been in an uptrend after it was violently pushed down. From \[1\] We can see it got to \[2\], but what do we see at \[2\]? A very reassuring gap. It didn't stop there, instead it kept running and eventually closing green for the day. What does this tell us just from this picture without knowing anything else? The chart simply yells "Bullish!". Very bullish!      That is really what the chart shows.    &amp;#x200B;   **The Verdict**      Take a look once more again at the chart above with the last FOMC commentary (figure 1). What do you see?  The biggest moves in the market comes just during the Fed Chair's Press Conference at 2:00PM EST. For the last FOMC (Feb 1), there were two giant green candles and a spike. The next day, it gapped up and ended in green.       ***There are couple of ways this FOMC could play out tomorrow:***      ***(A) No surprises: Rate comes in as expected (0.25%) - SPY/SPX continues with the up movement and possibly ending the way with green. ===&gt; BULLISH***     ***(B) Rate comes in worse than expected (0.50%) - like a ripe apple hanging at the top of a tree, SPY crashes right to the ground.  ===&gt; BEARISH***     ***(C) No rate change  - market could go either way ==&gt; BEARISH/BULLISH***     From the above, I think I am going to listen to what the chart is saying. I am going with (A).      ***Risk Management:***  *It is quite possible that even with a 0.25% rate hike, the market could come crashing. But the chart favors an upside move. It shows strength and more probability of a market rally. It is also important to note that the implied volatility is inflated, therefore, it is important to manage risk. Opportunities will continue to exist. Don't FOMO.*      Not financial advice, Goodluck!,;,; 2023-03-22 04:26:45]
[CPI Report For Feb 2023: Does This Still Have More Room To Run? ($SPX/$SPY),;,; &amp;#x200B;  [Where is the market headed with CPI? ](  On Tuesday, March 14 (8:00AM EST), the CPI figures for the previous month (February) will be released. These usually present great opportunity in the market as they are capable to move the market in one direction. If we know what the CPI prints are, we could be able to predict the market direction. The purpose of this exercise is to predict the market direction and profit by so doing.    **What is CPI**  The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of inflation and deflation. This is achieved by tracking how far prices have changed for a certain basket of goods. In the US, this analysis is managed by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and released monthly for the previous month.    **The Forecast / Estimates:**    *Current CPI: For this CPI (February), most analysts have estimates ranging from 5.8% - 6.1% (year-over-year). The consensus estimate is 6.0% (year-over-year) and 0.4% (month-over-month).*    *Last CPI: In the last CPI (January), inflation was at 6.4% (YOY) and 0.5% (MOM)*  &amp;#x200B;  What does this even mean?    Great question! This is simply telling us, from the figures above, that inflation is high. But it doesn‚Äôt stop there. In January inflation was high as 6.4% (YOY) and now, this February, inflation will be (or is) slightly down to 6.0% (YOY). Similarly, the MOM for January was 0.5% and for February, it has come down to 0.4%.    The simple answer would sound something like this:    ‚Äú*Inflation is fucking ‚Äòred hot‚Äô, but it seems to be cooling‚Äù*  That is what the figures are saying.     &amp;#x200B;  **The Market Direction**  The question here is what way will the market be headed tomorrow with the CPI release ‚Äì up or down? To answer that question we will need to take a look at the chart. Here is a picture of $SPY daily:  [SPY Daily ](  Do you see the story that this chart tells? It tells an interesting story. Doesn‚Äôt it?    What story is that?     From the chart, we can see that towards the end of December and beginning of January (point 1 on  chart), the market was in an uptrend all the way up to the beginning of February (Point 2) where price stalled and trended sideways for some time, and near the middle of February it broke downwards and headed down. Price halted the upwards movement at point 2 (on chart), but take a look at where that happened. Point 2 is a very important area, and we can see a similar movement at i (far left on chart).    From point 2, price headed down to point 3 and quickly began to go back up again but only shortly (this was 61.8% retrace of the prior downtrend movement). At 3i on the chart, we got a sign that the price was headed down once more again. It did and went all the way down to point 4 (a green bullish candle) which is where we are today, and one day before CPI data release for February.    Now we know what is going on in the grand scale. But what will the direction be tomorrow ‚Äì up or down?    &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  **The Verdict**  There are couple of scenarios that could unfold tomorrow after the CPI release.    (A) If the CPI data comes in as expected, that is *6.0% (year-over-year) and 0.4% (month-over-month) or better,* then SPY and SPX could continue to run up ending tomorrow with green. ==&gt; BULLISH  (B) If the CPI data comes in worse than expected, then SPY/SPX could fall like a ripe apple from the top of a tree. ==&gt; BEARISH  (C) Other considerations ‚Äì a rotten food attracts flies ‚Äì you may have seen or heard about the SIVB drama, SI too, and bank run. I have also begin to hear other people say market crash too. The point is that there is a lot of fear, uncertainty, and doubt in the market right now, and it may seem rather wise to consider these event with respect to the overall market picture. This has bearish implications.    &amp;#x200B;  *How Am I Playing This CPI?*    I am chasing this one with straight calls.    I will be watching the FOMC meeting next week and will be providing a report here for that too.    &amp;#x200B;  Good luck, NFA!,;,; 2023-03-14 00:26:08]
[Expected moves this week: SPY, QQQ, FOMC minutes, Jobs number.,;,; Futures are basically flat this morning into a holiday-shortened session. On the economic data front, the ISM PMI number will drop shortly after the open. Earnings reports are super light this week with nothing really of note today. Last week was a very positive one for stocks with the SPY up 2.3% on the week, a move more than double what options were pricing. With the move higher, IV was even lower, with the VIX actually putting in an intraday print below 13 on Friday. Once again, that's low levels of IV that the market hasn't seen since Covid dropped. Considering this is a holiday-shortened week those low levels are likely warranted, or at least understandable as traders do not want to be sitting on long premium during the dog days of Summer trading. But as has been mentioned in this space, it doesn't take much for stocks to move beyond those small expected moves, particularly on weeks like last week where there's a persistent bid in the market on a slow grind higher. Traders should be very very aware of both the risk of long premium, but also of how tight the breakeven levels of short premium trades can be with IV this low. Active trade management with small-win mentalities is how many traders approach these conditions.   For this week, SPY options are pricing just under a 1% move for what amounts to a 3-and-a-half-day week. That could change coming out of the holiday for the final 3 days as traders may re-adjust to more regular market hours. That's particularly true this week as the economic calendar picks up on Wednesday with FOMC minutes, then Thursday ISM services PMI, ADP jobs, and of course the non-farm payrolls on Friday. The earnings calendar is light this week but picks up in the second half of the month with banks and airlines beginning to report mid-month with big tech rolling in late month.   &amp;#x200B;  **Today's expected move (0DTE)**   * SPY 0.4%  * QQQ 0.5%  &amp;#x200B;  **Pre-Market:**     * Tesla Inc (TSLA) +6.13% * Nio Inc ADR (NIO) +4.44% * Micron Technology (MU) +0.19% * Xpeng Inc ADR (XPEV) +7.53% * Lucid Group Inc (LCID) +1.60% * Alphabet Cl C (GOOG) -0.32% * Rivian Automotive Inc Cl A (RIVN) +2.16% * Apple Inc (AAPL) -0.32% * Unitedhealth Group Inc (UNH) -0.48% * Astrazeneca Plc ADR (AZN) -6.62% * Li Auto Inc ADR (LI) +5.84% * Zhong Yang Financial Group Limited (TOP) -5.22%  &amp;#x200B;  **Today's Earnings Highlights:**   none of note  Full list here: [Options AI Earnings Calendar](  &amp;#x200B;  **Economic Calendar:**     * At 09:45 AM (EST) S&amp;P Global Manufacturing PMI (Jun) Estimates: 46.3, Prior: 48.4 * At 10:00 AM (EST) ISM Manufacturing PMI (Jun) Estimates: 47, Prior: 46.9 * At 10:00 AM (EST) ISM Manufacturing Employment (Jun) Estimates: 50.5, Prior: 51.4  &amp;#x200B;  **Scanner Highlights:**   Based on the prior day's trading action.     * **Overbought (RSI):** DAL (87), AAL (81), LUV (80), OSTK (80), JBLU (79), JETS (78), AAPL (78), OPEN (77), SNAP (74) * **Oversold (RSI):** OKTA (39), ETSY (39), MU (40), KO (40), TGT (40), ABBV (40), DOCU (41), GLD (41), JD (41) * **High IV:** NKLA (+211%), AMC (+206%), MANU (+172%), AZN (+136%), OSTK (+116%), SOFI (+114%), BUD (+113%), AMGN (+102%), RIVN (+102%), MRK (+101%), SPOT (+100%) * **Unusual Options Volume:** CMCSA (+1401%), BITO (+657%), XLI (+561%), RIG (+556%), OSTK (+531%), NKE (+486%), MSTR (+475%), CCL (+473%), AAPL (+450%), JPM (+440%), UPS (+398%)  Full lists here: [Options AI Free Tools](  &amp;#x200B;  **Chart of the Day:**  SPY options are pricing less than a 1% move for the week but that could change out of the holiday.  &amp;#x200B;   2023-07-03 13:22:44]
[Finding implied volatility, and more!,;,; I'm going to make this quick this is not really a post just where i can explain to a comment i posted. If you don't have a convenient broker that shows you how much the market is pricing in implied volatility like thinkorswim. Where you can see how much the underlying might move up or down within an options contract, you might have a ballpark area way.   I'm going to show a picture of AAPL option chain. looking at the 15 sep 23 expiration where they are pricing about a 6 move up , and down,as you can see on the Top far right. To get the ball park area of about 6 price move you will have to look at the ask on the option chain.  I usually use the put side but the calls side work too.   &amp;#x200B;    We look at the ATM ask price, and add the itm ask price then we will get the ballpark number which in real time is a lot better. On the call side we have a 2.52(ATM) and add the 4.05(ITM)(on the ask) then we get a ballpark of what the market is pricing in right now , which is 6.57. this work for all underlyings i find a little more tricky on the 5 point spreads thought.   More of what the market is pricing in love that number on the top right is a little skewed. Again this is what the buyers are targeting for their profit. Look at this bonus.   &amp;#x200B;    I'm about to delta hedge my bull put spread(XLU is falling so i hedged), which i have to do 4 more steps after it gets filled but seems cool to show.

I respect it could challenge the ATH and get pretty aggressive, so I chose a credit spread as opposed to opening any kind of debit with a Stop Loss. I chose a pretty high strike at more buying power to leverage into it because I'm conservative.  If I were a betting man I'd just do a synthetic short around $184 and keep a tight stop loss on it and bet that AAPL doesn't even significantly breach the ATH.,;,; 2023-06-02 17:05:15]

It provides investors with diversified exposure to stocks of companies that are expected to have higher-than-average growth rates. * AAPL - Apple  * TD - Always good to have at least one bank for diversification * AMZN - Amazon  I know VOO and VUG overlap, especially with AAPL and AMZN, but I want him to have 2 primary ETFs and 3 to 4 stocks.

[Is Apple Honestly Bearish Now?,;,; $AAPL on a weekly closing basis needs to close above $190 to break a (2) consecutive 5 WEEK rolling negative return...you think it's not a big deal...sure...maybe not but it has been POSITIVE SINCE JANUARY 13th, 2023 (a great time to buy)  &amp;#x200B;    This was the end of the bottom. Because that was the last week of (2) consecutive weeks of 5 WEEK Rolling negative return.  &amp;#x200B;    Here is the data from the weekly...if you want to be nit-picky...you could look at the 1/27/23 and say it was the time to actually go LONG but whatever.  What's important now is that if we close below $190 for APPLE this week...it will be (2 consecutive) weeks starting of negative returns. That's a highly correlated sign to negative returns going forward.  If it's flips to negative...is it time to sell?  The concern with Apple isn't even the change in sentiment. It's the size.  Every single money manager on the planet pays attention to Apple. Most own it, most mutual funds, etfs and sovereign wealth funds own it.  Apple is a safe bet or has been for years. Now things suddenly go south after earnings....fishy.  The environment for Apple's massive growth has changed.  I don't want to ramble but it's important to look at Apple if sentiment changes and boy did thins change.  What do you think? Can this make it? Will this be a reversal this week and we close above $190?  EDIT:  I didn‚Äôt say APPLE üçé was going to zero. I‚Äôm saying the price action has changed for now.

[TLT bottom at $100 == highly likely,;,; I tried to open some credit put positions on TLT and couldn't get a bid filled below $100 so didn't fill them as I have a big enough position already.  This is a sign no one is willing to sell below a $100, no one is concerned the price will go below $100, etc.  The credit for those puts was dismal.  I'm calling a bottom in TLT for the near term..next few months or so.  My interpretation is the market will do a flippening. Tech will drain out and money will flow back into some defensive/cyclical/income sectors and bring the indexes to some average. I shorted SPY as well as AAPL.  The only reason to do both is that AAPL was offering better money for the short. So it's like a kicker to a bet, more capital efficient than going all in one (higher risk) or the other (lower risk).

Even after gaining nearly 19% for the year-to-date ‚Äì vs. a 5.8% rise in the S&amp;P 500 ‚Äì Apple stock is still some 17% below its record close of early 2022.

[Can anyone help me explain NVDA?,;,; Hi,  I understand the top performance of the stock, their product innovation and quality, but this thing seems a bit over the top.  I'm modeling a revenue growth of 25% next year, and 20% p.a. for the next 4, which converges to a riskfree rate after that and reaches a massive $190B in sales in 10 years.   I even bump up the margins at 52% in that period, giving me an operating income of $103B in 10 years (this puts the company on par with what AAPL and MSFT make today), and is something that no hardware company makes close to - Yes, I'm aware its not 100% hardware because of CUDA.  Finally, after all is subtracted, I model a bottom line of $38B as free cash flows in year 10.  Here's the table, read it left to right as we go from the revenue to the free cash flows:  [NVDA Valuation Table](  And still, I get an intrinsic value of the company around $650B, a good +50% lower than the $1.4T at which NVDA trades today.  Here are the model outputs on the right:  [NVDA DCF Valuation Output](  What am I missing?   Can a NVDA bull explain the case for the $1.4T equity value? I understand that people sometimes just trade momentum, but maybe I'm wrong and I want to know if there is a scenario that the $1.4B can actually be justified?  Thanks!     P.S. I did an inverse on the model, and find that at maturity, NVDA needs to make about $65B FCFF in order to justify the $1.4T value. Can the company make this?

About a month or two ago I was fairly confident in a recession happening, but recently with new data coming out, it seems like there ain't gonna be a recession.

[Did you see any positives in Friday's action?,;,; I wanted to see if any of pros here could gleam any positives from Friday's action. The market was down from Monday to Thursday. Could a lot of institutions have thrown in the towel on Friday and did huge VWAP sell orders for the mega caps during the premarket and bought treasury bonds with the proceeds? I ask this because the advance decline ratio was very positive until after European close and lunchtime. I assume a big positive advance decline number is from manual buying of many stocks by fund managers. After European close and lunchtime, do these fund managers call it a week in terms of active buying? Then the computer driven VWAP orders that were in place at the start of the day are the sole source of movement which is downwards.

[These are the stocks on my watchlist (2/1),;,;    No positions in any stocks long-term but FAANG/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers)  To clarify since I've been asked: I usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel: they're just my perspective of where a stock could potentially go. Percentages signify what the stock is trading at when I write up the report and are NOT predictions of stock price EOD. Some of the stocks I post are &lt;$500M market cap and are NOT good long-term investments, but are good candidates to day trade.  **News :** [**Citizens CEO Calls NYCB an Outlier, Says Regional-Bank Pain Is in the Past**](  **Earnings:** AAPL, AMZN, META, X afterhours today.  **LFST,** liquidity 6/10-Short report released by Hindenberg on them.

Supply chain sources revealed that Apple (AAPL.O) iPhone 15 series will upgrade the OLED driver chip process from 40nm HV to 28nm HV, a change that will help further reduce power consumption and improve battery life.

[Conviction Buy List of Goldman Sachs. Which recommendation is your favorite?,;,; When Goldman Sachs labels a stock as a "Conviction Buy," it often indicates that the analysts believe the stock is undervalued, has strong growth prospects, and may offer a good opportunity for investors to achieve substantial returns. This recommendation is considered to be more forceful than a simple "Buy" recommendation, suggesting that the analysts have a particularly bullish outlook on the stock.  Here are their current recommendations:  **Vonovia**: German real estate company that specializes in residential property management and development. It is one of the largest residential real estate companies in Europe.  **L'Or√©al**: French cosmetics and beauty company, widely regarded as one of the world's largest and most influential players in the beauty industry.  **Amazon**: Technology and e-commerce company based in Seattle, Washington.  **BP (British Petroleum)**: One of the world's largest energy companies, with a significant presence in the global oil and gas industry.  **Apple**: Technology company based in Cupertino, California.  **Richemont**: Swiss luxury goods holding company.

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, March 6th, 2023-  *****  # [Stock futures are little changed as investors look ahead to Powell comments, jobs data this week]( ***** &gt; U.S. stock futures were flat Monday as Wall Street looked ahead to a week filled with economic data and the latest commentary from the Federal Reserve. ***** &gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 43 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 hovered around the flatline. ***** &gt; Traders are coming off a positive week for the major averages. The Dow industrials added 1.75% last week, ending a four-week losing streak. The S&amp;P 500 advanced 1.90%, while the Nasdaq capped the week with a 2.58% pop. ***** &gt; Those gains come even as the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose above the psychological 4% level at various points last week. An upward move in the 10-year yield raises borrowing costs for consumers and could signal a drop in investor confidence. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre afraid of a recession, go get the 10-year Treasury,‚Äù Sri-Kumar Global‚Äôs Sri Kumar told CNBC on Friday. ‚ÄúEquities are a losing proposition today, and until you see the valuations come down significantly, just don‚Äôt trust [Friday‚Äôs] rally.‚Äù ***** &gt; Important catalysts this week include congressional testimony Tuesday and Wednesday from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who will guide investors and lawmakers on how the central bank is thinking about inflation and its rate-hiking campaign going forward. ***** &gt; Traders are also anticipating the February jobs report on Friday, which follows January‚Äôs blockbuster report that showed the economy added 517,000 payrolls. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting 225,000 jobs added last month. ***** &gt; On Monday, the latest factory orders data will also be released after the bell. Economists are expecting a decline of 1.8% in January, according to consensus estimates from Dow Jones. That‚Äôs compared to a 1.8% gain in the prior reading.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](  *****  #LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](  *****  #TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](  *****  #LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](  *****  #THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](  *****  #THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](  *****  #THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$CRWD $SE $DKS $CIEN $JD $AZUL $ULTA $DOCU $MDB $BDSX $BJ $HPK $SOUN $NTNX $ADAP $DRIO $RIDE $TCOM $SQSP $CPB $FSTR $BNGO $AUTL $DOMO $SNCE $NINE $RNGR $DOLE $GPS $THO $PSFE $AVAV $CARA $GWRE $VFF $BBAR $ESTE $GOL $ASAN $ORCL $XXII $CASY $FERG $DAVE $WW $GEVO $PASG $FRWG*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$CIEN $BDSX $ADAP $FSTR $RIDE $SNCE $CECO $PASG $QTRX*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  #FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!]( ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](   *****  #FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!]( ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #2!](  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!]( ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](  *****  #THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:  * BOIL * KALA * BBIO * ESPR * MO * AAPL * KOLD * CTIC * CIEN * AMBI  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](  *****  &gt; **Ferrari** ‚Äî Shares of the luxury automaker rose less than 1% early Monday after Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas named it a top pick, replacing Tesla.

[Thoughts?,;,; First-time investor from Europe (just turned 21), looking to invest long-term and add mainly to VUSA through dollar-cost averaging yearly. Any opinions welcome. I know Revolut is not a popular choice of brokerage but many services that are available in the USA are not available here and I already owned the app/wanted an easy-to-use interface.

[Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY?,;,; A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings:    Data Sources:  * SPY Holdings: [Stock Analysis]( [Schwab]( [Yahoo Finance]( $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST)‚Äã * SFY Holdings: [Stock Analysis]( [Zacks.com]( [Yahoo Finance]( $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST)  **Key Observations:**  * Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. * Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. * Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.  It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.  I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:  1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. 2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&amp;P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. 3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. 4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. 5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. 6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.  It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance. Additionally, consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice is always recommended.  **What are your thoughts?**,;,; 2024-01-24 21:46:21]
[Stock Market Today (as of Mar 14, 2023),;,; Last night, the three major US stock indices opened low and closed high. The KBW Bank Index was down more than 11%, while the Nasdaq China Golden Dragon Index was up 1.1%. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down by 0.28%, the Nasdaq Composite was up by 0.45%, and the S&amp;P 500 was down by 0.15%.  The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond was down by 4.347% to close at 3.543%, with a spread of -44 basis points compared to the yield on the 2-year Treasury bond. The VIX was up by 6.94%, Brent crude oil was down by 2.47%, and spot gold continued to rise from November 2022, closing up 2.49% yesterday at $1913.54 per ounce. The US dollar index continued to fall from its high level, closing at 103.61.  The US President, Biden, delivered a speech on the banking system, stating that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has taken control of the assets of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank, and taxpayers will not incur any losses as the funds will come from insurance fund fees. He also announced that Congress and regulatory agencies will be required to strengthen bank regulations. HSBC Holdings acquired the UK subsidiary of Silicon Valley Bank for ¬£1, and the UK subsidiary's tangible assets are estimated to be around ¬£1.4 billion. The Dow Jones index will remove Signature Bank from some of its indices, and the MSCI Global Standard Index will remove SVB Financial Group.  Based on the Fed funds futures, it is most probable that the Fed will not increase interest rates any further.

Moreover, traders anticipate that the Bank of England will only increase interest rates by 25 basis points.  **Trending Stocks**  Last week, the banking sector of the US stock market saw a continued decline, with small and medium-sized banks such as FRC, WAL, and PACW joining Silicon Valley Bank in experiencing a sell-off.

[Roth IRA vs Cash vs Margin,;,; &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  I'm trying to understand if my math (and logic) is correct when comparing gains on like-trades but in different account types. For reference, my investment amount will be $200,000 via TD Ameritrade/Charles Schwab, 15% tax rate, and 13.00% effective margin rate. 28 years old. Employed. Not married. No children.  &amp;#x200B;  AAPL 2023 YTD performance is \~+55.25%. Past performance is not indicative of future results, I know. According to 1stock1, between 1981 and 2022, Apple has been positive 27 of those 42 years, with the strongest being +211.90% and the weakest being +5.42%. The average of the positive years is +67.8103704%. Apple has been negative 15 of those 42 years, with the worst being -71.06% and the least being -4.17%. The average of the negative years is -29.092%. 1995 to 1997 (3 years) was Apple's longest consecutive yearly losing streak. 2009 to 2014 (6 years) was Apple's longest consecutive yearly gain streak. The average of all 42 years is +33.202381%.  &amp;#x200B;  Roth IRA contribution limit in 2024 is $7,000. Non-deductible. Tax-free at distribution in retirement. $7,000 + 30% = $9,100. Gain of $2,100  &amp;#x200B;  Cash account of $7,000 + 30% = $9,100. Gain of $2,100 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $1,785  &amp;#x200B;  I can see that in this example, the Roth IRA is the better choice as opposed to the cash account. However, the Roth IRA is limited to the $7,000 annual contribution. Any additional investing must be done in the cash account. As a result, the current optimal solution would be to contribute into the Roth IRA up to the limit and invest the remaining $193,000 in the cash account and continuing the annual contribution into the Roth IRA in following years.  &amp;#x200B;  Margin account of $7,000 + $7,000 (margin) = $14,000. $14,000 + 30% = $18,200. Gain of $4,200 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $3,570 - my cost of margin for 1 year which is (.13 \* 7000) = Gain of $3,570 - $910 (margin) = Gain of $2,660.  &amp;#x200B;  I can see that in this example, with the same $7,000, AFTER taxes AND cost of margin, the margin account is the better choice as opposed to both the cash account and the Roth IRA. Similar to the cash account, I have no annual contribution limit, can withdraw at any time, and can invest the full $200,000. With margin, this amount becomes $400,000. As a result, the current optimal solution appears to be investing the full amount of $200,000 + $200,000 in the margin account and disregarding the Roth IRA entirely.  &amp;#x200B;  While I take much greater risks investing that amount in a margin account and having the knowledge/information that the average of Apple's yearly losses is \~-30%, over the long term, it's clear on paper that the optimal strategy is to go full margin, with the honest hope that the first 2-3 years are positive. I also expect my current effective margin rate of 13.00% to decrease as rates go down. I also expect my income to increase at a reasonable pace. I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning or not but I would like to marry and have children in the future.  &amp;#x200B;  Again, is my math (and logic) correct? Am I completely overlooking something?  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks!!  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;,;,; 2023-12-22 17:58:38]

[Stock Market Today (as of Mar 17, 2023),;,; Last night, the three major US stock indexes opened low and closed high, with semiconductors and large technology stocks leading the gains. As of the close, the Dow Jones was up by 1.17%, the Nasdaq was up by 2.48%, and the S&amp;P was up by 1.76%.  The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond was up by 3.615%, closing at 3.583%, with a spread of -58 basis points compared to the two-year Treasury yield. The VIX dropped 12.05%, Brent crude oil was up by 1.1%, and spot gold continued to rise from November 2022 to the present, with a slight increase of 0.03% yesterday, reaching $1919.3 per ounce. The US dollar index continued to fall from its high position, closing at 104.45.  The number of people filing for initial jobless claims in the US was lower than expected at 192,000, which suggests that the labor market is still strong despite large tech companies cutting jobs. This may be due to employers being hesitant to lay off workers during the pandemic, which has made it challenging to find labor. However, there are still 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person, indicating a tight labor market, and combined with high inflation, the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates next week. Nevertheless, the volatile financial market has created uncertainty for the economy.  Credit Suisse has released a memo stating that they will continue to focus on returning cash to investors in the Supply Chain Finance Fund. As of March 7th, they have returned around $6.8 billion to SCFF investors.

[The Month Review: Technical Analysis &amp; Trade Journal for May 2023,;,; **OVERALL**:  Comparing the majors side-by-side show just how lopsided this 'rally' has been, with a clear breakout in QQQ, neutral consolidation in SPY, and clear bearish consolidation in IWM.  If IWM is playing the role of leading indicator as it often does, then this could tilt probabilities to the downside as we enter the summer...but...the similarities between how QQQ consolidated &amp; SPY is currently consolidating could indicate one final push higher for the broader market, before the larger macro bearish pattern plays out.  Only time will tell, but what is equally clear is how much resistance is sitting on top of all three majors, due to the down-move they made over the course of 2022.  &amp;#x200B;    **SPY**:  Price continued to grind higher over the course of May, and is currently struggling to break out of the February 2022 double top.  As a result, price remained in the mid-point of its upwards channel over the past month.  If price action follows what the QQQ did when it consolidated in a similar fashion, then the August 2022 double top (431.73) and the channel ceiling are major resistance before any true break out can occur.  Conversely, if this consolidation fails to move higher, then both upsloping channel floor TLs are major support.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;    **QQQ**:  The consolidation which occurred throughout April definitely played out in a big way throughout all of May.  Price ripped out of the channel &amp; through the August 2022 double top...and appears to be heading to a confluence of major resistance areas, namely the March 2022 gap fill at 361.10 to the March 2022 double top at 371.83.   That August 2022 double top (334.42) and upsloping TL from channel price broke out of are now the major resistance levels for tech.  Given how extended price is both from the October 2022 lows and since the May 2023 break out, as well as that confluence of resistance TLs, probabilities indicate at least consolidation...if not a bigger pullback to major support.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;    **IWM**: While May saw decent swings up/down on a daily basis, overall the index continues to consolidate sideways in what is a clear bear flag off the down-move that occurred in March.  The upsloping TL of the parallel channel floor is the major resistance line; whereas the October 2022 double bottom is the major support line.  Before hitting those levels, price would need to break out of that bear flag, however, which puts immediate resistance &amp; support at 179-180 &amp; 171-170 respectively.

[Tesla ($TSLA) stock and six other tech titans are responsible for 86% of the S&amp;P 500 2023 performance.,;,;    Tesla($TSLA) stock **plunged nearly 10% last week on earnings**. That caught everyone's attention, but it was just the tip of the iceberg.  0 seconds of 14 secondsVolume 0%   With roughly one-third of the S&amp;P 500 companies **announcing quarterly earnings results this week**, there are none bigger than tech titans **Alphabet** ($**GOOGL**), **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**) and **Meta Platforms** ($META). These four Big Tech stocks alone account for 41% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 year-to-date gain, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.  Adding **Apple** ($**AAPL**), which reports next week, **Nvidia** ($**NVDA**) and **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) stock, Colas says these seven tech giants account for 86% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 gain, which was 7.7% through Monday's close. These seven Big Tech stocks have rallied far more than the S&amp;P 500 this year.  According to Colas, there have been three drivers of outperformance for these tech leaders. First, all seven were deeply oversold at the end of 2022 and received a "January Effect" bounce.  The January Effect is a seasonal increase in stock prices throughout the month of January. The increase in demand for stocks in January is often preceded by a decrease in prices during the month of December, in part due to tax-loss harvesting.     Second, many of these tech companies have been aggressively cutting costs, so earnings power should now be higher than last year. And, finally, interest rates have declined, supporting the valuation of high-multiple stocks, he added.  ## Alphabet, Microsoft Earnings Due  Google-owner Alphabet reports earnings after the closing bell Tuesday. Shares are just below a 106.69 buy point in a **cup with handle**, according to **IBD MarketSmith** chart analysis.  Alphabet earnings are expected to measure $1.08 a share on revenue of $68.8 billion.  Dow Jones software giant Microsoft slid almost 2% midday Tuesday, threatening to extend a losing streak to four sessions ahead of the company's earnings results late Tuesday. MSFT stock is rolling back toward a 276.86 buy point in a **flat base** following a March 17 breakout.  Wall Street expects Microsoft to earn $2.24 a share on revenue of $51.0 billion, per FactSet estimates.     ## Amazon, Meta Earnings Also On Deck  E-commerce giant Amazon continues to trace the right side of a **cup base**, but is seeing resistance around its long-term 200-day moving average.  With earnings due out late Thursday, Amazon is expected to earn 21 cents a share on sales of $124.5 billion.  Facebook parent Meta Platforms will report Wednesday after the stock market closes. Meta stock is out of buy range past a **197.26 buy point** in a flat base, but receding.  The social media giant is expected to earn $2.02 a share on revenue of $27.6 billion.  ## Apple Earnings Next Week  Apple shares reversed squarely lower midday Tuesday. Still, they remain solidly above a 157.48 buy point and at the top of the **5% buy range** that runs up to 165.35.  The Dow Jones tech giant reports its fiscal second-quarter results on May 4. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to earn $1.43 a share on sales of $92.9 billion.     ## Nvidia Holds Up; Tesla Stock Breaks Down  Graphics-chip maker Nvidia remains near its recent highs despite sharp losses midday Tuesday. Shares declined more than 2% in afternoon trade.  The **IBD Leaderboard stock** broke out past a 230.59 handle buy point after the **company's strong earnings on Feb. 23**.  Electric-vehicle giant Tesla stock continues to trade near its lowest level since Jan. 26. In recent weeks, shares triggered the **7%-8% loss rule** from a buy point at 200.76 in a cup with handle. And they are trading sharply below their 50-day line, a key level.,;,; 2023-04-26 06:14:46]
[SP500 Technical Analysis &amp; Trading Plan for 8/4/23,;,; *I share my plan for educational purposes and discussion and it is not intended as trade recommendations or ideas. This plan uses Futures levels for analysis.*  ***Recap***: The market again gapped down in the extended hours, briefly moving back towards the expanding range structure in the lower **4550**s and then losing **4530**, a core support level I was watching. In my premarket note, I wrote that one scenario I was looking for was for the market to *‚ÄúTest lower to* ***4504*** *and then a reclaim over the overnight lows at* ***4510*** *would be a good long for me. This would be combined with a gap fill, which targets yesterday‚Äôs low at* ***4528***.‚Äù  I tried this trade first shortly after the open and was a tad early. I tried the trade again about an hour later: Though the test lower was not precisely to 4504, nothing in markets is and all levels exist in something of a ‚Äúzone‚Äù as opposed to precise touches. I got long at 4515 and exited at **4528**, and let my final runner get stopped out on a nice gain due to a trailing stop.   ***Balance/Trend***: After a couple of weeks of balance, the market broke to the downside and has now moved over 100 points lower from Monday/Tuesday highs and is one time framing down for three days now. Even so, the medium and longer term trends are still pointing up and today‚Äôs test to **4506**ish was a hold of the pink trendline that formed the previous ascending triangle.  ***Analysis***: Today‚Äôs support trade initially proved to be a strong move on the part of bulls as the market moved over 30 points higher, though this faltered late ahead of major earnings (AAPL/AMZN) and NFPs due out tomorrow morning.  There are a few core technical structures I am watching:  * The pink trendline in pink which was/is the lower part of the ascending triangle is at **4509-12** for tomorrow. A failure here would likely take the market down to test the resistance that structure broke out from on July 12. I am viewing this as a zone from **4494-98** and would trade it like a pivot (longs above / shorts below) * The expanding range is marked in red in the charts, and if the market continues higher than I would watch for a move back inside of that range at **4550** for longs, or for it to act as resistance (a backtest following a breakout) for shorts * Prior to an overnight low on August 2, I was tracking the balance range as **4559-4609/20** * The aqua blue trend up since March, with support now around **4429**  ***Plan***  * With some of the plan already outlined above in Analysis, the next spots down I am watching for support **4520** and **4497**. Recall that there is a gap from **4497** down to this level, and so I would watch this level as a potential support, but also a trigger for a move through that gap down to **4479**. It is confluent with that triangle breakout level too. * Below that is a spike in the market at **4466** from July 11 that preceded the breakout * **4449** and potentially extended down to **4438**. This was a major decision level in June and into July before the market broke out * Some of the major resistance areas I am watching tomorrow are outlined above. Outside of that, the nearest spot I am watching for resistance is at **4433** * If the market re-enters the expanding range and finds its way back into the balance area, I would first watch for resistance at about **4566** * Just above that is **4570** where the gap that opened up yesterday morning is found. Trading above this level could see a gap fill while a failure there could be indicative of sellers that are still present in that zone * Other spots for resistance are **4582**, **4589**, the balance area high range, **4625**, **4645**   2023-08-03 20:05:57]
[Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&amp;P 500 gains,;,; = just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing =  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023  [  &amp;#x200B;  The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&amp;P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.  &amp;#x200B;  It‚Äôs an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inflation battle, noted FactSet‚Äôs Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 top performing days for the S&amp;P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday‚Äôs close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%.  &amp;#x200B;  Through Dec. 22, the S&amp;P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&amp;P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.  &amp;#x200B;  Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&amp;P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  That didn‚Äôt mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.  &amp;#x200B;  Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.  &amp;#x200B;  Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.  &amp;#x200B;  The strategy ‚Äúindicates the Fed‚Äôs measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,‚Äù Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&amp;P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks‚Äô bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group‚Äôs announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.  &amp;#x200B;  SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a ‚Äúmini‚Äù banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.  &amp;#x200B;  Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks ‚Äî Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com]( Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%,  and Meta Platforms Inc.  META, 0.56%.  &amp;#x200B;  See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?  &amp;#x200B;  Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high:  &amp;#x200B;  The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs overall return, he wrote, with the company‚Äôs success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.,;,; 2023-12-27 15:52:27]

[(3/3) Friday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,;,; #Good Friday morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the final trading day of this week. Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-  *****  #[Stock futures climb on Friday as S&amp;P 500 tries to snap 3-week losing streak: Live updates](  ***** &gt; U.S. stock futures rose Friday as investors pondered the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate-hiking path in light of fresh commentary from central bank speakers. ***** &gt; Nasdaq-100 futures were up 0.3%, and S&amp;P 500 futures advanced 0.2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 33 points. ***** &gt; Those moves come as U.S. Treasury yields retreated. The benchmark 10-year yield fell more than 6 basis points to 4%. The 2-year rate dipped to 4.855%. ***** &gt; The major averages are on their way to a positive week. The S&amp;P 500 is up 0.28%, on pace to snap a three-week decline, while the Nasdaq has a 0.6% gain. The Dow is also up 0.6% on the week. ***** &gt; The Dow on Thursday had its best day since Feb. 13, closing 1.1% higher. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.7%. These gains came after Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said that he thinks the central bank can keep its interest rate hikes to 25 basis points rather than the half-point increase favored by some other officials. ***** &gt; However, Fed Governor Christopher J. Waller struck a tougher tone in his comments to the Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America, raising the possibility of a higher terminal rate if inflation numbers don‚Äôt cool. ***** &gt; He referred to January‚Äôs big payrolls report, which showed the economy added 517,000 jobs, as well as the latest reading from the consumer price index and personal consumption expenditures reports. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIf those data reports continue to come in too hot, the policy target range will have to be raised this year even more to ensure that we do not lose the momentum that was in place before the data for January were released,‚Äù Waller said. ***** &gt; The road ahead is a tough one for the central bank, regardless of the messaging they‚Äôre relaying to the public. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúNo matter how slow the Fed goes, no matter how much they ‚Äòcommunicate‚Äô what they want to do, there is no avoiding the potholes of reversing extraordinary easing,‚Äù Bleakley chief investment officer Peter Boockvar wrote in a note. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúWhen markets and the economy have been addicted and medicated for so long on low rates and QE, there will never be the right time to ease up,‚Äù he said. ***** &gt; On the economic data front, the Institute of Supply Management is due to release its Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers‚Äô Index (PMI) report on Friday morning. Investors will also listen for further commentary from central bank officials, including Fed Governor Michelle Bowman and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin.  *****  #STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](  *****  # YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](  *****  # TODAY'S MARKET MAP: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](  *****  #YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](  *****  #TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&amp;P SECTORS CHART!](  *****  #TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](  *****  #NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](  *****  #NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](  *****  #NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**) (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)  *****  #THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR: (*$HIBB $INTT $ONCY $STXS $RPID $OFS $SAMG*) ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  #EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**) (NONE.)  *****  #YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!]( ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!]( ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](  *****  #YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](  *****  #TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR: ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!]( ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](  *****  #THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:  * HUBC * AI * CHPT * SI * COST * AVGO * MRVL * SSYS * PLMI * VZ  *****  #THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:  ######(**source: [cnbc.com](  *****  &gt; **C3.ai** ‚Äî Shares surged 17% after C3.ai reported third-quarter results that topped expectations.

[What I do to make a lot of money,;,; I gave up a while ago trying to use collars and protective puts. The strategies made no sense to me at some point, the nuances of which I forgot some time ago. Basically I stopped seeing value in them.  The likely reason is that let's say you are afraid your stock would go down so you pay $5 for a protective put. The stock goes down $5 as you thought and then stays there and your put expires worthless because everyone thought the same thing which is why the puts were worth $5 in the f\*\*king first place. You paid $5 for no protection and raised your cost basis by $5.  Do this enough times and you end up breaking even at best meaning you just held your stock to the bottom anyway, and at worst you ended up paying MORE for the pleasure of losing money.  I make about 50 trades a month so ... I have a lot more personal experience with two things I think most people take for granted:  * Scalability * Compoundabilty  Nobody should really care if you have different experiences in an account where in your entire lifetime you've traded less than I probably do in a single week.  Yes I realize anecdotes are not "valid" - but good luck getting my results from your backtesting and paper trade practicing.  Anyway.  The collar is just a screwy version of the protective put, where you think if you get a zero cost you have improved protection but the same rules above apply only now you cap your gains - usually so that you are called away at a break even price or it hits the put and stalls and you get little protection and noting much really changed so why did you put the trade on in the first place.  In my experience over thousands of trades...if you want to protect equity just sell out of the position.  But this isn't a thread about protection - it's a thread about making money.  If I want to stay in the trade what I've found works better is:  1. Be properly sized so that you don't get liquidated 2. Layer in short puts under your underlying if it drops. This is effectively DCA'ing and lowering cost basis. 3. If the stock price is recovering just sell more puts until you reach your adjusted cost basis. This prevents you from "Selling the hole" and closing the trade for an inevitable loss if you try to lower cost basis through covered calls. 4. When you have sufficient gains (above adjusted cost basis); only then sell covered calls. 5. Stop selling puts in this case because you're just exposing yourself to violating step #1 above. Selling puts is like adding to the trade, and in this case step #1 is "be properly sized so you don't get liquidated."  If you're hanging out there sitting on all your buying power in credit put spreads on something like AAPL at a strike like $170 because you were following steps 3 through 4 and didn't let the puts expire and close out that side...  Don't cry to me when the stock falls significantly in the money and you have no buying power to manage the trades for a profit.  Step 1.  BE PROPERLY SIZED.  \----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Anyway.  I don't care you think I'm cocky. This is the best damn strategy anyone will probably ever tell you. I'm giving it to you for free.  There's some mathematical reasons this is what works and collars, protective puts, iron condors, butterflies, your moms sock drawer and jade lizards and all that other stuff out there inevitably doesn't, I just don't know anymore how to teach this stuff. I've tried.  Oh and to you Theta Gang gurus. Don't ever Wheel, it just ends up boxing you in to a pinned-price that is usually your break even and you might as well just have held shares. Don't believe me? Get back to me when you retire.  It comes down to the results:  * It's scalable * It's compoundable * Almost nothing else is  Three rules to live and die by.  Rule #1. If it's not a buy it's a sell and if it's good enough to sell it's good enough to short.  No I don't care if you think that's a stupid rule (as some do). It's from one of the greatest traders to ever live, who made the equivalent of $1billion in today's money trading, lost it all, and made it all back. So until you do that you don't really get to come up with your own rules now do you?  The next rule is by another legend.  Rule #2. You don't know how big, small, really is.  BE PROPERLY SIZED.  Rule #3. Never lose your position.  If you aren't able to lower your cost basis then you're not making money. If you can't scale or compound it, you aren't making money.  What I described above works...I guess I can write another 10 pages on why it works. But it just works. You lower cost basis. You survive draw downs. You can scale, you can compound.  YOU MAKE MONEY.  It's simple....making money is easy. If it's hard, you're doing it wrong.,;,; 2023-06-02 07:01:02]
[Dow Jones rises but leaders tumble, and Tesla ($TSLA) stock triggers the sell rule.,;,;  Dow Jones futures were little changed early Thursday, along with S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The stock market rally struggled Wednesday as weak economic data raised recession fears for a second straight session.    The major indexes still don't look too bad, with the Nasdaq sliding but the Dow Jones rising.  But once again, declining stocks decisively beat winners. Once again, many of those losers fell hard. But on Wednesday, a lot of more of those big losers were leading stocks, such as **On Holding** ($**ONON**), **MarketAxess** ($**MKTX**) and **PagerDuty** ($**PD**). **C3.ai** ($**AI**) sold off for a second session, with the AI stock now staging a massive, outside week to the downside.  Others, including many chip names, declined solidly, now showing more chart damage after relatively modest retreats Tuesday.  **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) skidded for a third straight day, triggering the automatic sell rule.   Megacap techs such as **Apple** ($**AAPL**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**), Google parent **Alphabet** (**GOOGL**), **Meta Platforms** ($**META**) and **Nvidia** all fell.  Meanwhile, bank stocks came under more pressure. **Western Alliance Bancorp** (**WAL**) plunged, leading a retreat in regional banks, though they pared losses in the afternoon. **Charles Schwab**hit a two-year closing low. While bank deposits may be relatively safe, the bigger issue now may be long-term bank profitability as well as lending curbs that rapidly slow the economy.  Medical names are looking relatively strong, along with other defensive growth or defensive plays.  PagerDuty stock, On Holding, Meta and Nvidia are on **IBD Leaderboard**. Microsoft and Google stock are on the **IBD Long-Term Leaders** list.   Despite relatively benign action in the major indexes, the weakness in growth and other leading stocks is concerning. Investors should be looking to protect profits and cut losses.  ## Costco Sales Weak  Costco same-store sales fell 1.1% in March vs. a year earlier, the first decline in nearly three years. U.S. comps slid 1.5%. Excluding gasoline and currency effects, comps rose 2.6% or 0.9% in the U.S. E-commerce comps tumbled 11.6%. COST stock fell modestly.  ## Dow Jones Futures Today  Dow Jones futures edged higher vs. fair value. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.2%.  The Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. That follows unexpectedly weak February job openings and the March ADP Employment Report. Labor will release the March jobs report on Friday morning, but U.S. markets will be closed.   ## Stock Market Rally  The stock market rally had a generally negative session, despite the mixed action on the major indexes.  The ADP Employment Report showed private payrolls rose much less than expected in March, a day after a big drop in February job openings. The March ISM services index fell more than expected, signaling rapidly slowing growth.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% in Wednesday's **stock market trading**. The S&amp;P 500 index dipped 0.25%. The Nasdaq composite retreated 1.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 1%.  U.S. crude oil prices dipped 0.1% to $80.61 a barrel.  The 10-year Treasury yield declined 5 basis points to 3.285%. That's the lowest point in nearly seven months. The 2-year Treasury yield sank 7 basis points to 3.76%, off 34 basis points in the past four sessions.  ## ETFs  Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ($**FFTY**) shed 1.9%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ($**BOUT**) gave up 0.65%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ($**IGV**) slipped 1.3%. Microsoft stock and a few other heavyweights dominate IGV, while more-speculative software names like PagerDuty suffered bigger losses. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([**SMH**]( gave up 1.75%, with NVDA stock a major holding.  Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF ($**ARKK**) slumped 3.6% and ARK Genomics ETF (**ARKG**) shed 1.8%. TSLA stock is the top holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. Some Ark funds also own PD stock.  SPDR S&amp;P Metals &amp; Mining ETF (**XME**) retreated 1.15% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (**PAVE**) 1.7%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (**JETS**) and SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (**XHB**) descended 1.5%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (**XLE**) climbed 1.5% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (**XLV**) rallied 1.7% to its best level since Feb. 14.  ## Bank Stocks  The Financial Select SPDR ETF (**XLF**) edged down 0.1%, with SCHW stock a top 10 holding. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (**KRE**), which includes WAL stock, sank 1% but finished off lows.  Western Alliance stock plunged as much as 19.4% after releasing some financial metrics but not disclosing deposits. Shares came off their lows as the California-based bank disclosed deposits fell 11% on March 31 vs. the end of 2022, not as bad as some feared. Still, WAL stock closed down 12.4%.,;,; 2023-04-06 11:23:50]

Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, March the 16th, 2023-  *****  # [Dow futures slip, regional bank shares drop: Live updates](  ***** &gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Thursday as regional banks slid once again on growing fears of a crisis in banking within the U.S. and Europe. ***** &gt; Futures tied to the 30-stock index were down 94 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures were down 0.2%, while Nasdaq-100 futures traded up 0.3%. ***** &gt; Credit Suisse announced overnight it will borrow up to nearly $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank to assure short-term liquidity. That offered some relief to the embattled bank in extended hours after it fell to a record low Wednesday following reports that the Saudi National Bank, Credit Suisse‚Äôs largest investor, said it would not provide additional assistance. U.S.-listed shares gained 5% in extended trading after falling just under 14% in the prior session. ***** &gt; But the news was not enough to quell fears on Wall Street of an impending crisis, leading regional banks to take another leg down in Thursday‚Äôs premarket. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) slid 2.6% in extended trading, led down by a more than 26% drop in First Republic Bank. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs also similar to ‚Äô08 is the hunting in the market for who‚Äôs the most weak next,‚Äù said Greg Fleming, CEO of Rockefeller Capital Management and former president of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, on CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúSquawk Box.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd the proxy‚Äôs been uninsured deposits.‚Äù ***** &gt; Growing concern over Credit Suisse sent other European banking stocks lower and reverberated in U.S. markets beginning Wednesday. The Dow at one point Wednesday fell 725 points before ending the day down by 280.83 points, or 0.87% lower. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.7%. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no doubt changing the landscape of how we as investors look at the investability of financial institutions that fit in the banking sector,‚Äù said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. ‚ÄúIt also makes us ponder just how the sector would navigate with, in the future, more forms of regulatory pressure on these corporations.‚Äù ***** &gt; Traders will keep an eye out for key economic data, including the latest jobless claims report.

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023,;,; Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023.  # **Stocks close higher Friday as investors try to shake off latest bank fears: Live updates - [(Source)]( ***** &gt; Stocks rose Friday, reversing their earlier session declines as Deutsche Bank shares pared back some losses. ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 132.28 points, or 0.41%, closing at 32,238.15. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.57%, while Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.3%. The major indexes all had a winning week, with the Dow gaining 0.4% week-to-date as of Friday afternoon, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq gained 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively. ***** &gt; Deutsche Bank‚Äôs U.S.-listed shares slid 3.11% Friday, rebounding from a 7% drop earlier in the trading session. A selloff of shares was triggered after the the German lender‚Äôs credit default swaps jumped, but without an apparent catalyst. The move appeared to raise concerns once again over the health of the European banking industry. Earlier this month, Swiss regulators forced a UBS acquisition of rival Credit Suisse. Deutsche Bank shares traded off their worst levels of the session, which caused major U.S. indexes to also cut their losses. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think that the market overall is neither frightened nor optimistic ‚Äî it‚Äôs simply confused,‚Äù said George Ball, president at Sanders Morris Harris. ‚ÄúThe price action for the last month-and-a-half, including today, is a jumble without any direction or conviction.‚Äù ***** &gt; Ball added that Deutsche Bank is ‚Äúvery sound financially.‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIt could be crippled if there‚Äôs a big loss of confidence and there‚Äôs a run on the bank. There is, however, no fundamental reason why that should occur, other than nervousness.‚Äù ***** &gt; European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde tried to ease concerns, saying euro zone banks are resilient with strong capital and liquidity positions. Lagarde said the ECB could provide liquidity if needed. ***** &gt; Investors continued to assess the Fed‚Äôs latest policy move announced this week. The central bank hiked rates by a quarter-point. However, it also hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be ending soon. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that credit conditions have tightened, which could put pressure on the economy. ***** &gt; On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said regulators are prepared to take more action if needed to stabilize U.S. banks. Her comments are the latest among regulators attempting to buoy confidence in the U.S. banking system in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank closures. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúRetail [and] institutional investors are both looking at the banking system, but now internationally. That‚Äôs dangerous,‚Äù Ball added. ‚ÄúBanks exist because of confidence in their stability, and that confidence can be eroded as we now see, via social media and technology in a matter of minutes.‚Äù  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](   *****  &gt; # Best and Worst Stocks Since the COVID Crash Low  &gt; We are now three years out from the COVID Crash low, and even with the past year's weakness, most assets continue to sit on solid gains.

For example, while its gains have been more middling since the COVID crash, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has been the strongest area of the equity market in 2023 thanks to the strength of sectors like Tech (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC). Although those sectors have posted strong gains this year, they have been the weakest over the past three years while Energy (XLE) far and away has been the strongest asset class. Paired with the strength of energy stocks has been solid runs in commodities (DBC)more broadly with the notable exception being Natural Gas (UNG) which has lost over 40%. Bond ETFs are similarly sitting on losses since the COVID Crash lows. As for international markets, Mexico (EWW) and India (PIN) have outpaced the rest of the world although Emerging Markets (EEM) as a whole have not been particularly strong; likely being dragged on by the weaker performance of China (ASHR) which holds a large weight on EEM.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Taking a look at current S&amp;P 500 members, nearly half of the index has more than doubled over the past three years. As for the absolute best performers, Energy stocks dominate the list with four of the top five best-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks coming from that sector. Targa Resources (TRGP) has been the absolute best performer with a nearly 900% total return. Other notables include a couple of heavy weight stocks: Tesla (TSLA) and NVIDIA (NVDA) with gains of 563.9% and 412.9%, respectively.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; On the other end of the spectrum, there are currently 25 stocks that have posted a negative return since the COVID Crash low. The worst has been First Republic Bank (FRC) which has been more of a recent development. Whereas today the stock has posted an 83.1% loss, at the start of this month it would have been a 65% gain. Another standout on the list of worst performers has been Amazon (AMZN). Most other mega caps have more than doubled since the March 2020 S&amp;P 500 low, however, the e-commerce giant has hardly offered a positive return.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Sector Performance Experiences a Historical Divergence  &gt; The first quarter of 2023 is coming to a close next week, and checking in on year to date performance, there has been a big divergence between the winners and losers. Although the S&amp;P 500 is up 2.84% on the year as of yesterday's close, only three of the eleven sectors are higher. Not only are those three sectors up on the year, but they have posted impressive double digit gains only three months into the year. Of those three, Consumer Discretionary has posted the smallest gain of 10% whereas Technology and Communication Services have risen 17.2% and 18.1%, respectively. The fact that these sectors are home to the main mega cap stocks -- like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have been on an impressive run of late -- helps to explain how the market cap weighted S&amp;P 500 is up on the year without much in the way of healthy breadth on a sector level.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; One thing that is particularly remarkable about this year's sector performance is just how rare it is for a sector to be up 10%+ (let alone 3) while all other sectors are lower. And that is for any point of the year let alone in the first quarter. As we mentioned in yesterday's Sector Snapshot and show in the charts below, going back to 1990, there have only been two other periods in which a sector has risen at least 10% YTD while all other sectors were lower YTD. The first of those was in May 2009. In a similar instance to now, Consumer Discretionary, Tech, and Materials were the three sectors with double digit gains back then. With those sectors up solidly, the S&amp;P 500 was little changed on the year with a less than 1% gain. As you can see below, though, by the end of 2009, every sector had pushed into positive territory as the new bull market coming out of the global financial crisis was well underway.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The next occurrence was much more recent: 2022. Obviously, it was a tough year for equities except for the Energy sector which had a banner year. Throughout most of the year, the sector traded up by well over 20% year to date even while the rest of the equity market was battered.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # The Fed Expects Banking Stress to Substitute for Rate Hikes  &gt; The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 0.25% at their March meeting, bringing it to the 4.75-5.0% range. This is the ninth-straight rate increase and brings rates to their highest level since 2007. However, the most aggressive tightening cycle since the early 1980s, which saw them lift rates all the way from near zero to almost 5%, is near its end.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Up until early February, Fed officials expected to raise rates to a maximum of about 5.1% and hold it there for a while. However, since that time, we‚Äôve gotten a slew of strong economic data, including elevated inflation numbers. This pushed fed officials to give ‚Äúguidance‚Äù that they expected to raise rates by more than they estimated back in December.  &gt; Market expectations for policy also moved in conjunction. Prior to February, markets expected the Fed to raise rates to 5% by June, and subsequently lower them by about 0.5% by the end of the year. But strong incoming data and Fed guidance pushed expectations higher, with the terminal rate moving up to 5.6% and no cuts in 2023.  &gt; # The Silicon Valley Bank crisis changed everything &gt; The bank crisis that erupted over the last couple of weeks resulted in a significant shift, both in expectations for policy and now the Fed as well. See here for our complete rundown on SVB and the ensuing crisis.  &gt; Market expectations for Fed policy rates immediately moved lower. Markets expected the stress in banks to translate to tighter credit conditions, which in turn would lead to slower economic growth and lower inflation.  &gt; This was nicely articulated by Professor Jeremey Siegel, one of the foremost commentators on financial markets and fed policy, in our latest episode of the Facts vs Feelings podcast, Prof. Siegel said that tighter credit conditions, as lending standards become more strict, are de facto rate hikes.  &gt; Fed Chair Powell more or less said exactly the same thing after the Fed‚Äôs March meeting. The 0.25% increase was an attempt to thread the needle between financial stability and fighting inflation. Fed officials also forecast the fed funds rate to hit a maximum of 5.1%, unchanged from their December estimate. This is a marked shift from what was expected just a few weeks ago, with Powell explicitly saying that tighter credit conditions ‚Äúsubstitute‚Äù for rate hikes.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; # There‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty ahead &gt; While the recent bank stresses are expected to tighten credit conditions and thereby impact economic growth and inflation, there are a couple of open questions:  &gt; * How big will the impact be?  &gt; * How long will the impact last?  &gt; These are unknown currently. Which means future policy is also unknown.  &gt; Fed officials expect to take rates to 5.1%, i.e., one more rate increase. And then expect to hold it there through the end of the year. In short, they don‚Äôt expect rate cuts this year.  &gt; Yet investors expect no more rate increases and about 0.6% of rate cuts in the second half of 2023. Markets expect the policy rate in June to be at 4.8%, while expectations for December are at 4.2%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; There‚Äôs clearly a huge gulf between what the Fed expects versus what investors expect. This will have to reconcile in one of two ways:  &gt; * Market expectations move higher ‚Äì if economic/inflation data remain strong and credit conditions don‚Äôt look to be tightening significantly.  &gt; * Fed expectations move lower ‚Äì if the banking sector comes under renewed stress, credit conditions could tighten significantly and eventually lead to weaker data.  &gt; Things are obviously not going to go in either direction in a straight line. It‚Äôs going to be a bumpy ride as new data points come in, not to mention news/rumors of renewed problems in the banking sector.  *****  &gt; # Seasonality Keeps Claims Below 200K?  &gt; Initial jobless claims remained healthy this week with another sub-200K print. Claims fell modestly to 191K from last week's unrevised reading of 192K. That small decline exceeded expectations of claims rising up to 197K. Given claims continue to impress, the seasonally adjusted number has come in below 200K for 9 of the last 10 weeks. By that measure, it has been the strongest stretch for claims since last April when there were 10 weeks in a row of sub-200K prints. Prior to that, from 2018 through 2020 the late March and early April period similarly saw consistent readings under 200K meaning that some of the strength in the adjusted number could be on account of residual seasonality.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; In fact, this point of the year has some of the weeks in which claims have the most consistently historically fallen week over week. Taking a historical median of claims throughout the year, claims tend to round out a short-term bottom in the spring before an early summer bump. In other words, seasonal strength will begin to wane in the coming months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; While initial claims improved, continuing claims worsened rising to 1.694 million from 1.68 million the previous week. Albeit higher, that remains below the 2023 high of 1.715 million set at the end of February.  *****  &gt; # A Fed Day Like Most Others  &gt; Yesterday's Fed decision and comments from Fed Chair Powell gave markets plenty to chew on. As we discussed in last night's Closer and today's Morning Lineup, there have been a number of conflicting statements from officials and confusing reactions in various assets over the past 24 hours. In spite of all that uncertainty, the S&amp;P 500's path yesterday pretty much followed the usual script. In the charts below we show the S&amp;P's average intraday pattern across all Fed days since Powell has been chair (first chart) and the intraday chart of the S&amp;P yesterday (second chart). As shown, the market's pattern yesterday, especially after the 2 PM ET rate decision and the 2:30 PM press conference, closely resembled the average path that the market has followed across all Powell Fed Days since 2018.  &gt; The S&amp;P saw a modest bounce after the 2 PM Fed decision and then a further rally right after Powell's presser began at 2:30 PM. That initial post-presser spike proved to be a pump-fake, as markets ultimately sold off hard with a near 2% decline from 2:30 PM to the 4 PM close.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; So what typically happens in the week after Fed days? Since 1994 when the Fed began announcing policy decisions on the same day as its meeting, the S&amp;P has averaged a decline of 10 basis points over the next week. During the current tightening cycle that began about a year ago, market performance in the week after Fed days has been even worse with the S&amp;P averaging a decline of 0.99%. However, when the S&amp;P has been down over 1% on Fed days (like yesterday), performance over the next week has been positive with an average gain of 0.64%. As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****   &gt; # What Now? An Update on Recent Bank Stress.  &gt; It‚Äôs been less than 2 weeks since Silicon Valley Bank‚Äôs stunning 48-hour collapse, and a few more banks have been caught in the fray. New York regulators closed the doors on Signature Bank on Sunday, March 12. A week later, US banks injected $30 billion into First Republic Bank to keep it afloat, and UBS acquired rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse in a government-brokered deal. In the midst of the chaos, your Carson Investment Research team was there for you with client-facing content, professional advice, and investment solutions. In fact, we think this event presents an opportunity to invest in the more stable large-cap financial companies and recently upgraded the sector to overweight in our House Views Advice.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; # Why is this happening? &gt; The rapid hike in interest rates caused an asset and liability mismatch for banks. Due to many years of low-interest rates, banks invested assets in interest-earning loans and bonds that would be repaid over the next five-plus years, which at the time was a logical way to earn a higher yield. Regulators considered government bonds to be among the safest ways a bank could invest its capital. As interest rates rose, bond values dropped. Interest rates rose at the fastest pace in history, and the safe assets that banks invested in lost value to the tune of more than $620 billion in unrealized losses as of the end of last year. This decline in value left weaker banks underwater and, when coupled with depositors pulling money out, caused them to collapse or seek costly capital raises.  &gt; # Why this matters to investors? &gt; The weakness in the banking sector will likely lead to tighter lending standards, potentially slowing economic growth. The reason we‚Äôre in this mess, to begin with, is that the Fed hiked interest rates to slow the economy because inflation was rising too quickly. Perhaps the 16% drop in oil prices over the past two weeks reflected this slower growth and bodes well for continued falling inflation. Thus, the Fed is closer to achieving its goal.  &gt; Maybe it‚Äôs an overreaction as ‚Äúbanking crisis‚Äù headlines stir painful memories of 2008. Either way, an environment with slower growth and lower inflation isn‚Äôt a bad time to invest. Bonds and stocks could both perform well, especially stocks of companies with the ability to grow earnings. We also reiterate our House Views Advice overweight on the large-cap Financials sector. The largest US banks are well-capitalized and are gaining market share from the smaller regional banks. We believe this calamity provides an opportunity for stronger banks and investors to capitalize on.  *****  &gt; # FANG+ Flying  &gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup, sector performance has heavily favored areas like Tech, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services in recent weeks. Playing into that sector level performance has been the strength of the mega-caps. The NYSE FANG+ index tracks ten of the largest and most highly traded Tech and Tech-adjacent names. In the past several days, that cohort of stocks is breaking out to the highest level since last April whereas the S&amp;P 500 still needs to rally 4% to reach its February high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Although FANG+ stocks have been strong recently, that follows more than a full year of underperformance. As shown below, relative to the S&amp;P 500, mega-cap Tech consistently underperformed from February 2021 through this past fall. In the past few days, the massive outperformance has resulted in a breakout of the downtrend for the ratio of FANG+ to the S&amp;P 500.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; More impressive is how rapid of a move it has been for that ratio to break out. Below, we show the 2-month percent change in the ratio above. As of the high at yesterday's close, the ratio had risen 22.5% over the prior two months. That comes up just short of the record (22.6%) leading up to the pre-COVID high in February 2020. In other words, mega-cap Tech has experienced near-record outperformance relative to the broader market. However, we would note that this is in the wake of last year when the group had seen some of its worst two-month underperformance on record with the worst readings being in March, May, and November.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # March Seasonality Prevails, Banking Fiasco Be Damned  &gt; It‚Äôs encouraging typical March seasonal patterns have overcome recent bank failures, recession talk and fearmongering. The early March pullback was steeper than normal, but the usual mid-month rebound appears to be materializing.  &gt; Last week‚Äôs gains could be an indication we have seen the worst of the banking fallout and the end of the pullback. Triple Witching Weeks have tended to be down in flat periods and dramatically so during bear markets. Positive March Triple Witching weeks in 2003 and 2009 confirmed the market was back in rally mode.  &gt; The week after March Triple Witching is notoriously nasty. S&amp;P is down 27 of the last 40 year ‚Äì and frequently down sharply. Positive or flat action this week would be constructive.  &gt; In the old days March used to come in like a bull and out like a bear. Nowadays March has evolved into an inflection point where short-term trends often change course. The market is clearly at an important juncture and it‚Äôs a good time to remember Warren Buffet‚Äôs wise words to ‚ÄúBe greedy when others are fearful.‚Äù  &gt; Bank failures are never a good thing, but the swift actions of regulators likely prevented further damage to the industry. At the least, the banks are likely to be under even greater scrutiny going forward. In the near-term we expect more volatile trading. Further out we expect the market, and the economy will recover like they both have historically done.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Nasdaq Leaves the S&amp;P in the Dust  &gt; Looking at the major US index ETF screen of our Trend Analyzer shows just how disconnected the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has become from other major index ETFs recently. As shown below, as of Friday's close, QQQ actually finished in overbought territory (over 1 standard above its 50-DMA) whereas many other major index ETFs were oversold, some of those to an extreme degree. On a year to date basis, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has rallied more than 14% compared to low single digit gains or losses for the rest of the pack.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Historically, the major indices, namely the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, tend to trade at similar overbought and oversold levels. In the chart below we show the Nasdaq 100 and S&amp;P 500's distance from their 50-DMAs (expressed in standard deviations) over the past five years. As shown, typically the two large cap indices have seen similar albeit not identical readings. That is until the past few weeks in which the two have diverged more significantly.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; On Friday there was more than 2 standard deviations between the Nasdaq's overbought 50-DMA spread and the S&amp;P 500's oversold spread. As shown in the chart below, that surpassed recent highs in the spread like the spring of 2020 to set the highest reading since October 2016.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Going back to 1985, the spread between the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 50-DMA spreads diverging to such a degree is not without precedent, but it is also not exactly common. Friday marked the 16th time that spread eclipsed 2 standard deviations for the first time in at least 3 months. Relative to those prior instances, the current overbought and oversold readings in both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are relatively middling. However, only the instance in early 2000 similarly saw the Nasdaq technically overbought (trading at least a standard deviation above its 50-DMA) while the S&amp;P 500 was simultaneously oversold (at least one standard deviation below its 50-DMA).  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 24th, 2023**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3/26/23**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; (*$CCL $BNTX $LULU $MU $IZEA $SKLZ $WBA $HTHT $FUTU $LOVE $RH $PAYX $IHS $GOEV $CALM $PLAY $RUM $CTAS $CNM $MKC $BB $EVGO $VERO $AUGX $RGF $GMDA $SNX $RAIL $AEHR $PVH $SRT $UGRO $AADI $PRGS $DNMR $NEOG $CONN $IMBI $SOL $LOV $GROY $EE $ABOS $CNXC $UNF $AMPS $JEF $ESLT $CURI $DARE*)  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  &gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).  &gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  # DISCUSS!

[Apple becomes first U.S. company to reach $3 trillion market cap,;,;    * **Apple hit a market cap of $3 trillion briefly during trading on Monday.** * **The milestone is mostly symbolic but it represents investor recognition of Apple‚Äôs success over the past few years as the company has reported several record-breaking quarters of big growth in all of its product lines.** * **Apple‚Äôs cash flow also makes the stock a safe haven during times of market uncertainty.**  Apple briefly hit a market cap of $3 trillion during intraday trading on Monday, before dropping back under the mark shortly afterwards. Apple broke the barrier when its share price hit $182.86.  Apple rose 2.5% on Monday to close at $182.01, just missing closing the trading day at the $3 trillion mark.   The milestone is mostly symbolic but it shows investors remain bullish on Apple stock and its ability to grow. At a market value of $3 trillion, Apple tripled its valuation in under four years. And analysts see plenty of room to run.  Apple showed annual growth across all of its product categories in its fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue up 29% year-over-year. While the iPhone is still the biggest sales driver, Apple‚Äôs services business grew 25.6% year-over-year and delivered more than $18 billion in revenue during the quarter.   In December, for example, Morgan Stanley‚Äôs Katy Huberty raised the firm‚Äôs price target on Apple from $164 to $200, and maintained the equivalent of a buy rating, arguing that new products like virtual reality and augmented reality headsets aren‚Äôt yet baked into the share price.  Huberty also said she expects Apple‚Äôs App Store revenue to outperform Morgan Stanley‚Äôs forecasts for the quarter and for Apple to ship 83 million units during the December quarter, 3 million more than anticipated.  Apple sold 27 million pairs of its newest AirPods model over the holidays, driving 20% year-over-year growth for Apple‚Äôs wearables business during the quarter, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TFI Asset Management Limited said in a Monday note.  Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote on Sunday that the mark is a ‚Äúwatershed moment‚Äù but has more room to grow, especially since Ives values Apple‚Äôs services business at $1.5 trillion.  Investors also turned to Apple as a safe haven during recent market uncertainty, thanks to its strong balance sheet and prodigious cash flow, which it uses to invest in new products, stock buybacks and to return capital to shareholders through dividends.  Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to hit a $1 trillion market cap during intraday trading on Aug. 2, 2018. It hit a $2 trillion valuation just over two years later on Aug. 19, 2020.  Apple‚Äôs peers aren‚Äôt far behind. Microsoft is worth about $2.5 trillion, Amazon has about a $1.75 market cap and Google‚Äôs market valuation is just shy of $2 trillion.  Apple stock rose 34% in 2021.,;,; 2023-06-14 09:30:13]

[Apple's Fiscal Year 2022: Diving into the Numbers,;,; Hello everyone,  I've recently taken a deep dive into Apple's fiscal report for 2022, and a couple of figures stood out to me. Using the graphic I've examined, I've observed some interesting revenue shifts. Most notably, there's an 8% decrease in iPad revenue, a significant drop considering Apple's usual stability in the tablet market. Additionally, when breaking down revenue by region, Japan ‚Äì traditionally a strong market for Apple ‚Äì has experienced a 9% drop in revenue.  Several factors might contribute to these shifts ‚Äì product lifecycle, competition, market saturation, local economic conditions, or even changes in consumer preferences. Still, these drops seem quite "high", especially for such a colossal company.  Does anyone have insights or theories about why Apple saw a decrease in these specific areas?

[Refurbished iPhones boost Apple‚Äôs share of the Indian market.,;,;      Apple has experienced a big boost in demand in India, driven by a surge in refurbished iPhone sales in Asia‚Äôs second-biggest economy.  The iPhone accounted for 11 per cent of secondary smartphone sales in India last year, up from 3 per cent in 2021, making it the ‚Äúfastest-growing refurbished brand in India‚Äù, according to data from Counterpoint Research, a market intelligence group.  Apple has pinned its hopes for future growth on India as the US tech giant looks to ramp up its share of the world‚Äôs third-largest smartphone market.  Chief executive Tim Cook met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in April as it opened the company‚Äôs first two Apple stores in the country. The iPhone maker is also building up its nascent manufacturing operations in India as it looks to unwind its dependence on China.  Apple‚Äôs share of new smartphones in India grew to 5 per cent last year, up from 1 per cent in 2019. Demand has been limited by the luxury price point, as the average sales price of a new iPhone is Rs80,000 or nearly $1,000.  But the brand has experienced unprecedented interest in the secondhand smartphone market, which acts as a gateway into Apple‚Äôs network of products and services.  Refurbished iPhones are ‚Äúselling like hot cakes,‚Äù said Glen Cardoza, a Mumbai-based analyst for Counterpoint. The research found that volumes grew by a fifth in 2022, four times the global average.       Devices as old as the iPhone 6, released in 2014, were still finding a third or fourth life in the Indian market, while 5G-equipped models ‚Äî the iPhone 12 and upwards ‚Äî were particularly ‚Äúprecious‚Äù, added Cardoza.  ‚ÄúCustomers who wish to buy an iPhone in the future are the ones who normally buy the secondhand iPhones, just to test them, just to learn how to use them,‚Äù said Deven Meher, a sales executive at Mumbai-based Prowesses Enterprises, which sells refurbished and reused Apple products.  In terms of new smartphone sales, Apple is the only major company expected to grow global shipments this year. This is largely down to India, where iPhone shipments are projected to grow by ‚Äúa massive‚Äù 31 per cent in 2023, compared to 2 per cent in China and none in the US, its two biggest markets, according to Counterpoint.      The iPhone‚Äôs second-hand popularity is partly due to the device‚Äôs sturdiness in comparison to competitors, analysts say. Globally, half of the refurbished smartphone market is captured by Apple.  ‚ÄúApple is a brand with a much higher resale value,‚Äù said Harshit Pandey, Bengaluru-based senior consultant at Redseer Strategy Consultants. An iPhone ‚Äúpasses through three or four hands before it gets obsolete‚Äù.   Analysts said the iPhone‚Äôs secondary market growth could be significantly higher but supply has been limited by two major factors.  The Android-dominated country currently has a small base of available refurbished iPhones. Meanwhile, Delhi has largely prohibited the import of used phones from abroad since 2012 over concerns it could impact initiatives to support domestic manufacturing.¬†  Apple, which supports the secondary market because of its sustainability initiatives and because iPhone owners are likely to stay with Apple for the long term, has lobbied against this law over the past decade, according to two people familiar with the effort, but not with any success. Apple declined to comment.  ‚ÄúApple has an enduring, aspirational appeal among India buyers,‚Äù said Prabhu Ram, head of industry intelligence group at CyberMedia Research. ‚ÄúThe brand‚Äôs salience and loyalty \[are\] really strong.‚Äù   [ 2023-05-03 05:41:58]

[Dr. Techy| Why are so many Apple executives leaving? Tim Cook‚Äôs new headache,;,; *You would be surprised to know that over the last few months, Apple* *has lost about a dozen high-ranking executives.*  &amp;#x200B;    Apple, known for its stability among its management officers, is eyeing an unprecedented wave of executive departures, signaling internal risks amid slowed growth and innovation shortage. Since the latter¬†half of 2022, Apple has lost 11¬†high-ranking executives. Most of these people carried the title of vice president, which is a position directly under senior vice presidents that reports to the company‚Äôs CEO¬†Tim Cook.   The majority of these departures were Apple veterans, mostly vice presidents in charge of industrial design, online retail, information system, cloud, hardware and software engineering, security, and procurement.  &amp;#x200B;    Source: Bloomberg  Yes, it‚Äôs a cross-department turnover in its VP ranks, as the chart shows. In addition, the lower ranks could be ready for turnover as well. People within Apple believe that some executives at the director and senior director levels (the two management tiers directly below vice president) also are considering stepping down in the not-too-distant future.   **So, what are reasons for Apple‚Äôs reshuffle?**  Some of the VPs left Apple for **retirement**¬†since they‚Äôve been there for decades. But the accelerated departures must have been motivated by factors that go beyond retirement. The reasons are mainly as follows:  First, the growing **burden**¬†of responsibilities placed on managers and little hope of stepping upstairs result in turnover.   Second, the company has grown more **bureaucratic**¬†over the years, especially when it comes to product development.   Third, **internal politics and cross-department disputes**¬†make it more challenging to navigate.  Last but not least, **resources**¬†have been prioritized to longer-term projects, some of which may take years to be completed. Some managers were probably upset about losing people to initiatives like the [mixed-reality group](¬†and [self-driving vehicle team](  &amp;#x200B;    And, it‚Äôs always about the **money**, ranking among the top reasons for leaving a job. After making significant increases for three years, Apple's stock dropped by roughly 30% last year. It affects the compensation of everyone at the company. Even Cook has suffered on that front as well. Apple shareholders approved on Friday to accept a new pay plan that included a 40% cut.  **In conclusion**, a profound internal turnover may be unavoidable at a time when Apple's veterans are leaving, growth is slowing, and products are no longer flashing.  In any case, talent recruiting will always be a priority for the innovation-driven company, especially in the backdrop of fierce competition in the metaverse, electric vehicles, and the buzzing artificial intelligence these days.  &amp;#x200B;    New bloods both in higher and lower executive ranks may be a revolution from the inside out for Apple. Microsoft, Intel and other tech giants have seen CEOs come and go in the past few years and their new businesses and changes polish the big names.  Talent is never the only headache for Apple and Tim Cook. Anyway, how Apple navigates its way through challenges in products, technology, and supply chain is always in the spotlight.

[Probably a good reminder at all time highs .....,;,; **Warren Buffett is piling up cash because he sees a storm brewing and can't find bargains, wealth manager says**  [  &amp;#x200B;  Warren Buffett's stack of cash is bigger than ever because he spies problems on the horizon and he's struggling to find bargains, one wealth manager says.  Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway held a record $157 billion in liquid assets like dollars and Treasury bills on September 30. The astonishing sum made up 15% of its $1 trillion of assets at the time, and it's equivalent to 20% of the company's $783 billion market capitalization as of Thursday's close.  "I think he sees trouble next year," Lee Munson, the president and chief investor of Portfolio Wealth Advisors, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday about the significance of Buffett's cash pile. "It means be cautious. He doesn't see any screaming deals."  Buffett struck a dour tone on the US economy in May, warning of a "different climate" versus the rock-bottom interest rates and freewheeling government spending during the pandemic. He predicted that most of Berkshire's subsidiaries would report profit declines this year.  As a value investor, Buffett specializes in buying stocks and businesses at a discount to their actual worth. He's pledged to always have at least $30 billion of liquid assets at Berkshire to ensure the company never fails to meet its financial commitments. Having plenty of dry powder also enables him to pounce on cut-price assets and strike lucrative deals at tough times, as he did during the 2008 financial crisis.  Buffett made his fortune by investing in American companies like Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz, but as valuations have steadily climbed over the past decade, he's had to expand his search to find compelling deals. For example, he revealed 5% stakes in five Japanese trading houses in August 2020, and has grown those positions to nearly 9% since then.  "Honestly, it's just hard to find good companies at a reasonable valuation," Munson said about Buffett's challenge today. "The fact that he's going to Japan to find things with a PE that's reasonable, I think tells us a lot about this market."  Buffett and his team revealed this week that they pared their huge Chevron stake and exited a bunch of long-held positions last quarter. Yet they didn't touch their two largest holdings, Apple and Bank of America.  Munson said that Berkshire is essentially pursuing a barbell strategy of owning both growth and value stocks. The conglomerate's Apple stake is similar to holding the S&amp;P 500, given the Big Tech stock's outsized influence on the benchmark index, while the Bank of America bet is a cheap, large-cap value play, Munson said.  "I think those are the two winners of those two indexes," Munson said.,;,; 2023-12-28 16:59:42]

[Roth IRA vs Cash vs Margin,;,; &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  I'm trying to understand if my math (and logic) is correct when comparing gains on like-trades but in different account types. For reference, my investment amount will be $200,000 via TD Ameritrade/Charles Schwab, 15% tax rate, and 13.00% effective margin rate. 28 years old. Employed. Not married. No children.  &amp;#x200B;  AAPL 2023 YTD performance is \~+55.25%. Past performance is not indicative of future results, I know. According to 1stock1, between 1981 and 2022, Apple has been positive 27 of those 42 years, with the strongest being +211.90% and the weakest being +5.42%. The average of the positive years is +67.8103704%. Apple has been negative 15 of those 42 years, with the worst being -71.06% and the least being -4.17%. The average of the negative years is -29.092%. 1995 to 1997 (3 years) was Apple's longest consecutive yearly losing streak. 2009 to 2014 (6 years) was Apple's longest consecutive yearly gain streak. The average of all 42 years is +33.202381%.  &amp;#x200B;  Roth IRA contribution limit in 2024 is $7,000. Non-deductible. Tax-free at distribution in retirement. $7,000 + 30% = $9,100. Gain of $2,100  &amp;#x200B;  Cash account of $7,000 + 30% = $9,100. Gain of $2,100 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $1,785  &amp;#x200B;  I can see that in this example, the Roth IRA is the better choice as opposed to the cash account. However, the Roth IRA is limited to the $7,000 annual contribution. Any additional investing must be done in the cash account. As a result, the current optimal solution would be to contribute into the Roth IRA up to the limit and invest the remaining $193,000 in the cash account and continuing the annual contribution into the Roth IRA in following years.  &amp;#x200B;  Margin account of $7,000 + $7,000 (margin) = $14,000. $14,000 + 30% = $18,200. Gain of $4,200 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $3,570 - my cost of margin for 1 year which is (.13 \* 7000) = Gain of $3,570 - $910 (margin) = Gain of $2,660.  &amp;#x200B;  I can see that in this example, with the same $7,000, AFTER taxes AND cost of margin, the margin account is the better choice as opposed to both the cash account and the Roth IRA. Similar to the cash account, I have no annual contribution limit, can withdraw at any time, and can invest the full $200,000. With margin, this amount becomes $400,000. As a result, the current optimal solution appears to be investing the full amount of $200,000 + $200,000 in the margin account and disregarding the Roth IRA entirely.  &amp;#x200B;  While I take much greater risks investing that amount in a margin account and having the knowledge/information that the average of Apple's yearly losses is \~-30%, over the long term, it's clear on paper that the optimal strategy is to go full margin, with the honest hope that the first 2-3 years are positive.

[A Deep Dive on PayPal: Is it a good time to Buy? [DD],;,; A couple of years ago, PayPal was all the hype. Today, the stock is down 75% from its all-time high. Once a growth stock, PayPal is now moving towards value stock territory. The big question here is this. Is PayPal worth buying right now? Is it a bargain or is it a value trap?  # Operations  First of all, let's look at PayPal's operations. PayPal's main source of revenue are the fees that PayPal charges for completing transactions and other payment-related services. Other revenue sources include foreign currency conversion fees and also fees for purchasing or selling cryptocurrencies. As such, PayPal's business model is based on the volume of transactions. The more transactions, the more fees the company gets. In 2022, users, transactions and payment volume on PayPal increased.  * 2% increase in users to 435 million with 8.6 million new net accounts addedOut of these, 400 million were consumer active accounts and 35 million were active merchant accounts * 16% increase in number of transactions to 22.3 billion * 9% total payment volume increase to $1.36 trillion on a spot basis so basically without adjusting for any forex changes.  The family of PayPal brands includes Braintree, Chargehound, Honey, Venmo and others so the company has a very strong brand presence. I keep seeing an ad for Honey almost every single day, I think the other brands are more US-focused (I'm UK-based), but the gist of it is that PayPal is becoming more popular, more established. [Recently, PayPal added more features to its payment solutions for small businesses.]( The main change was increasing the range of payment options for customers by including Apple Pay along with saving payment options and others.  # Competition  When it comes to mobile payments, PayPal competes with the likes of Google Pay, Cash App, Zelle, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Venmo although Venmo is actually owned by PayPal. They all have some pros and cons. However, PayPal appears to have the best international payment support. PayPal owns Xoom which allows users to send payments to users in 131 countries without the recipient needing an app or a smartphone. The recipient can just pick up the payment at their local bank. PayPal also allows you to send money to people in over 200 countries worldwide as long as they also have the app. PayPal is also ahead of the competition when it comes to web and website payments since you can complete the payment by using any web browser. Doesn't matter if it's Firefox, Chrome or Safari. However, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay can be used with smart watches which are becoming more and more popular.  ***US market***   In fact, this may be one of the reasons why Apple Pay is the most widely used mobile payment service in the US. 43.9 million people report using it at least once followed by Starbucks with 31.2 million. Yes, Starbucks, I know, I'm surprised as well, but it seems to be a popular method of payment in the US. Google Pay follows with 25 million users and Samsung Pay with 16.3 million users. Again, this is in the US.  ***Worldwide***   In terms of total mobile payment users worldwide, you have AliPay and WeChat Pay with 650 and 500 million users respectively, followed by Apple Pay with 507 million, Google Pay with 421 million and PayPal with 377 million. Venmo has 52 million, but it counted separately. If you combine the two since Paypal owns Venmo, Paypal comes ahead of Google Pay with 429 million users. Plus, AliPay and WeChat Pay are pretty much the status quo in China, but they are not that big outside of China. In fact, I'm not sure you can get them outside of China unless you are a Chinese national. Essentially, Google Pay, Apple Pay and Paypal are the big international names. Now, Google and Apple have a big advantage because they obviously produce their own phones, they have iOS and Android and they pretty much come with built-in Apple and Google Pay. They also have the smart watches which integrate with these payment apps.  ***Total Payment Volume competition***   Now, it would be really good if we could see the official total payment volume through these apps and compare it with Paypal. It could be the case where because the payment apps are installed by default, it seems they have a large userbase, but in reality users don't use them as much as Paypal or they just use them for small purchases. [The closest stats I could find were in this article here]( The author claims that Apple Pay has a total transaction volume of $6 trillion whereas Google Pay had $2.5 trillion. However, these are not official statistics by either of these companies. There are also disagreements over what exactly constitutes an Apple Pay or Google Pay transaction. In most cases, people don't pay with the apps, they just use the wallet option to pay with their actual card instead of paying with the digital payment app. Again, we don't know the exact transaction volume and we can just speculate, but we can see why Apple and Google Pay are massive competitors to Paypal. Still, the good thing is that the market for mobile payment apps is growing fast worldwide. There are a lot more users left to capture and Paypal is in a good position to do that as one of the leading payment apps, but enough about operations.  # Financials metrics  We know Paypal is big and we know it's not going anywhere. The company is a viable competitor to Google and Apple, but what are the financials of Paypal? Are they profitable? Are they efficient? What's the case here?  To answer these questions, I will look at Paypal's current and historical metrics and compare them to the company's peers in the Transaction and Payment Processing sector in the US. Quick note on the sector metrics. This sector is dominated by Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Fiserv, Block and Fidelity National Information Services. These 6 companies make up 77% of the total revenue in this sector. Meanwhile, 18 of the 35 companies in the sector are losing money. Basically, take the sector data with some hint of salt. I want to provide some comparison for Paypal, but at the same time we have a duopoly of Visa and Mastercard at the top and a lot of new players at the bottom.  Okay, so lets look at profitability. Paypal has a:  * gross profit margin of 42.35% which is below its 5-year average of 45.79% and the sector median of 47.32% * net income margin of 8.79% is also below its 5-year average of 14.58%, but above the sector median of 0.57% * levered free cash flow margin stands at 12.1% compared to its 5-year average of 14.58% and the sector median of 4.73% * Return on Equity is decent at 11.5% compared to the 5-year average of 16.7% and the sector median of 11.05%  Overall, Paypal is doing well. Their metrics have declined over the last few years which is worrying, but the change has not been that drastic \[yet\]. It's good to monitor these metrics of course because this could turn into a red flag if the trend continues.  # Analyst Expectations  Despite the above, analysts are expecting a steady growth in earnings per share over the next few years. The consensus is:  * 18.33% in 2023 * 15.28% in 2024 * 13.07% in 2025  In fact, analysts have recently started revising their expectations up which is a good sign. Basically, the sentiment towards Paypal is improving after a year and a half of declining expectations. This type of expectations change often leads to a reversal in stock price so this is one reason why I am turning bullish on Paypal.  Paypal has historically shown really good growth in revenue and earnings. Their compounded annual revenue growth is 17% since 2013 with their revenue going from $6,727 billion in 2013 to $27,518 billion in 2022. Their compounded annual earnings growth is 10.9% with earnings growing from $955 million in 2013 to $2.42 billion in 2022. By the looks of it, this type of growth can be sustained for at least another few years.  # Valuation  This is really, really good, mainly because the stock has lately been priced as a value stock. Paypal has:  * adjusted PE ratio of 18.15 compared to the 5-year average of 41.72. * adjusted forward PE ratio of 15.34 compared to the 5-year average of 37.94 * price-to-earnings growth ratio of only 1.1 compared to the 5-year average of 2 * relatively low forward price-to-book of 3.74 compared to the 5-year average of 8.1 * forward price-to-cash-flow of 11.84 compared to their 5-year average of 27.4  The way I see it, there are 2 reasons for the low valuation.  One, Paypal had a massively inflated stock price in 2021. Typically, you see a corresponding massive drop in price after this type of jump in valuation. Overreaction in one direction leads to overreaction in the opposite direction, a bit like a pendulum. This creates an amazing buying opportunity and I think we are seeing this right now.  The second reason for the low valuation could be that investors have different expectations to analysts. Even though the analysts expect a steady growth in earnings and profits, maybe investors don't see it that that way. Maybe there are some risk factors that analysts are overlooking. That's valid. Looking at Paypal's annual report, we can see a lot of factors that the company identifies. Cybersecurity is a crucial one, increasing competition is another. You also have legislation and compliance risk, you have risk to do with credit, third parties and so on. A lot of these are just regular day-to-day business threats that a financial processing company faces.  The main risk in my eyes is the increasing competition from Google and Apple. However, Paypal has some advantage there because it is mainly a financial company. Google and Apple have other more important business units and I think that Google Pay and Apple Pay are not as important to these companies as their core businesses. In comparison, payments and transactions are Paypal's core business. Cryptocurrency is also a growing risk, but I don't think it poses that big of a threat to Paypal right now. Maybe in 5 years or so. However, Paypal has been active in allowing users to buy, sell and transfer cryptocurrencies. Plus, users can actually use Paypal to pay in crypto although there are improvements that can be made there.  # Conclusion  Overall, I think that **we currently have a good bullish argument for Paypal**. The valuation is really cheap. We are seeing some of the lowest prices since December 2018. Even the company itself has committed to buying back a lot of shares because of the cheap price. In 2022, Paypal bought back $4.2 billion worth of shares or about 80% of their free cash flow. The management has said that they think share buybacks are an excellent way to spend their capital and I agree. They estimate that 75% of the free cash flow in 2023 will go towards share repurchases. In my opinion, this will create bullish pressure for the company. It will reduce the floating stock, it will increase ownership for existing shareholders and it will boost metrics. In terms of target price, the analyst consensus right now is $103.4 dollars or about a 38% upside on the current price of $75. I think that's a reasonable target for the next 12 to 18 months.  What do you think? Is Paypal a good purchase right now? Have I missed any important details about their business?,;,; 2023-04-10 10:44:32]

[Why am I bullish on SFY instead of SPY?,;,; A comparison analysis between the holdings of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY), I have compiled information from the most recent available data. Below is a table showing the top 10 holdings for each ETF along with their percentage weight in the respective ETFs. This gives an overview of how the ETFs allocate their assets among their top holdings:    Data Sources:  * SPY Holdings: [Stock Analysis]( [Schwab]( [Yahoo Finance]( $485.47 (as of 03:56 PM EST)‚Äã * SFY Holdings: [Stock Analysis]( [Zacks.com]( [Yahoo Finance]( $17.15 (as of 04:00 PM EST)  **Key Observations:**  * Overlap in Holdings: Both ETFs share several common holdings, including major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVIDIA. * Differences in Allocation: The percentage allocation to these common holdings differs between the two ETFs. For example, SPY has a higher allocation to Microsoft and Apple than SFY. * Sector Exposure: While this table focuses on the top holdings, the ETFs may have different exposures to various sectors. For instance, SPY is known for its significant technology sector weighting.  It's important to note that the full list of holdings for both ETFs includes many more companies, and these top 10 holdings represent only a part of the entire portfolio. When comparing ETFs, investors should consider the full portfolio, investment strategy, and other factors like expense ratio, performance history, and sector allocation.  I can provide a general analysis that could support why I'm bullish on the SoFi Select 500 ETF (SFY) compared to the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and It's important to remember that this is not personalized financial advice, but an interpretation of potential factors:  1. **Expense Ratio**: SFY is known for its low or zero expense ratio, which can be attractive for cost-conscious investors. Lower fees mean more of your investment goes to work in the market. 2. **Stock Selection Methodology**: SFY uses a slightly different approach in stock selection within the S&amp;P 500 universe, potentially focusing on stocks with specific characteristics that might be appealing depending on your investment philosophy. 3. **Performance Trends**: If recent performance trends of SFY align better with your investment goals than SPY, this could be a reason for a bullish stance. However, past performance is not indicative of future results. 4. **Portfolio Diversification**: Depending on the current composition of your portfolio, SFY might offer better diversification in line with your investment strategy. 5. **Market Positioning**: SFY's unique weighting methodology could position it well to capitalize on certain market trends or sectors you believe will outperform. 6. **Innovative Approach of SoFi**: Being a newer and more technology-oriented financial company, SoFi's approach to ETFs might align with a more forward-thinking investment strategy.  It is crucial to conduct thorough research and consider your own investment goals and risk tolerance.

[Interested in how you found your strategy,;,; Hey everyone, I'm thrilled to be in a position where I can invest $4k monthly at the age of 19. However, with this exciting opportunity comes the challenge of deciding where to allocate my funds and which investment strategy to pursue. Currently, l've evenly split my investments between an investment account and a high-yield savings account, both of which have grown to close to $20k. However, I can't help but feel that I might be missing out on potential returns by keeping too much in the high yield savings account and lacking a clear investment strategy for stocks. When I first started investing at 18, I focused on stocks that seemed promising and affordable. However, i've come to realize that this may not be the most effective strategy. Now that I'm taking investing Investing more seriously, I'm eager to explore new strategies. Recently, l've been experimenting with purchasing VOO, but aside from that, I'm feeling a bit lost on where to go next.

[Tesla ($TSLA) stock and six other tech titans are responsible for 86% of the S&amp;P 500 2023 performance.,;,;    Tesla($TSLA) stock **plunged nearly 10% last week on earnings**. That caught everyone's attention, but it was just the tip of the iceberg.  0 seconds of 14 secondsVolume 0%   With roughly one-third of the S&amp;P 500 companies **announcing quarterly earnings results this week**, there are none bigger than tech titans **Alphabet** ($**GOOGL**), **Amazon.com** ($**AMZN**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**) and **Meta Platforms** ($META). These four Big Tech stocks alone account for 41% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 year-to-date gain, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research.  Adding **Apple** ($**AAPL**), which reports next week, **Nvidia** ($**NVDA**) and **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) stock, Colas says these seven tech giants account for 86% of the S&amp;P 500's 2023 gain, which was 7.7% through Monday's close. These seven Big Tech stocks have rallied far more than the S&amp;P 500 this year.  According to Colas, there have been three drivers of outperformance for these tech leaders. First, all seven were deeply oversold at the end of 2022 and received a "January Effect" bounce.  The January Effect is a seasonal increase in stock prices throughout the month of January. The increase in demand for stocks in January is often preceded by a decrease in prices during the month of December, in part due to tax-loss harvesting.     Second, many of these tech companies have been aggressively cutting costs, so earnings power should now be higher than last year. And, finally, interest rates have declined, supporting the valuation of high-multiple stocks, he added.  ## Alphabet, Microsoft Earnings Due  Google-owner Alphabet reports earnings after the closing bell Tuesday. Shares are just below a 106.69 buy point in a **cup with handle**, according to **IBD MarketSmith** chart analysis.  Alphabet earnings are expected to measure $1.08 a share on revenue of $68.8 billion.  Dow Jones software giant Microsoft slid almost 2% midday Tuesday, threatening to extend a losing streak to four sessions ahead of the company's earnings results late Tuesday. MSFT stock is rolling back toward a 276.86 buy point in a **flat base** following a March 17 breakout.  Wall Street expects Microsoft to earn $2.24 a share on revenue of $51.0 billion, per FactSet estimates.     ## Amazon, Meta Earnings Also On Deck  E-commerce giant Amazon continues to trace the right side of a **cup base**, but is seeing resistance around its long-term 200-day moving average.  With earnings due out late Thursday, Amazon is expected to earn 21 cents a share on sales of $124.5 billion.  Facebook parent Meta Platforms will report Wednesday after the stock market closes. Meta stock is out of buy range past a **197.26 buy point** in a flat base, but receding.  The social media giant is expected to earn $2.02 a share on revenue of $27.6 billion.  ## Apple Earnings Next Week  Apple shares reversed squarely lower midday Tuesday. Still, they remain solidly above a 157.48 buy point and at the top of the **5% buy range** that runs up to 165.35.  The Dow Jones tech giant reports its fiscal second-quarter results on May 4. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to earn $1.43 a share on sales of $92.9 billion.     ## Nvidia Holds Up; Tesla Stock Breaks Down  Graphics-chip maker Nvidia remains near its recent highs despite sharp losses midday Tuesday. Shares declined more than 2% in afternoon trade.  The **IBD Leaderboard stock** broke out past a 230.59 handle buy point after the **company's strong earnings on Feb. 23**.  Electric-vehicle giant Tesla stock continues to trade near its lowest level since Jan. 26. In recent weeks, shares triggered the **7%-8% loss rule** from a buy point at 200.76 in a cup with handle.

[S&amp;P500 bad performance during inflation proof,;,; Hello,  &amp;#x200B;  I've ran the math and the S&amp;P500 during Covid just followed the money in circulation (M2 money supply). The increase in both was around 33%, so basically the net asset value is flat, as this 33% increase has the same purchasing power. But when I compared some of the top companies in the Indice APPL, MSFT, GOOG, TSLA and AMZN I've noticed that all of them made way more than 33%. Does this indicate it's way better for a safe haven investing **during inflationary times** to just focus on the top 5-10 instead of the "whole" market (the 500 companies).  &amp;#x200B;    I also did the math for the lowest 5 companies currently, as I don't know which they were during 2020 January. Only 1 company beat the 33% inflation and 4 were actually on a major LOSS.  &amp;#x200B;    Considering that S&amp;P500 is influenced more by the top than the bottom companies we can logically assume that the majority of the top companies performed poorly, as they are anywhere close to the absurd returns of the top 5-10.  Has someone done the math for other inflationary times? Is the expectation that those top companies will underperform in the coming years when inflation decreases and the smaller companies will catch up in terms of growth?,;,; 2023-08-31 07:41:18]

[Mullen Automotive Stock Price Hovers Under $0.10, Rumored Buyout and Upcoming Positive News Could Spark Major Surge to $1,;,; In the high-stakes world of business, rumors can be just as powerful as facts. This seems to be the case with the latest buzz surrounding electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, Mullen Automotive. With its stock price currently hovering under $0.10, a rumored buyout in the works has ignited hope among investors and industry experts that the company's stock price could soar back to $1 or higher.  Mullen Automotive has faced significant challenges in recent years, including intense competition and supply chain issues, causing its stock price to plummet. However, the rumor of a substantial investment or complete buyout by a major automotive conglomerate has given rise to optimism that the company may be on the cusp of a significant turnaround.  Although the identity of the potential buyer remains a mystery, the rumors have sparked intense speculation. Some believe that the buyer might be a well-established automaker looking to enhance its EV portfolio, while others suggest that a tech giant with an interest in the automotive sector could be the driving force behind the deal.  Sources close to the situation claim that the potential buyer has been conducting due diligence and evaluating Mullen's technology, manufacturing capabilities, and market presence. If the rumors turn out to be true, the acquisition could provide Mullen with the resources and backing needed to overcome its current challenges and compete more effectively in the rapidly growing EV market.  Even if the buyout rumor does not materialize, the company is expected to release several pieces of positive news in the near future, which could help drive the stock price upward. These upcoming announcements may include new product launches, strategic partnerships, or technological breakthroughs, all of which have the potential to boost investor confidence and propel the company to new heights.  The potential buyout news, combined with the anticipation of forthcoming positive updates, has created a stir among investors and analysts. Many predict that the stock price could surge back to $1 or higher upon confirmation of the deal and the release of additional good news. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that Mullen's stock could become a hot commodity, with investors clamoring to get on board before the price soars even further.  However, it is essential to remember that these rumors and expectations are currently unverified, and there is no guarantee that a deal will come to fruition or that the positive news will have the desired impact on the stock price. As always, investors are advised to exercise caution and consider multiple sources of information before making any decisions.  With the supposed announcement date of March 31st fast approaching, and the promise of upcoming positive news, the industry is holding its breath to see if these developments will lead to a game-changing acquisition or significant growth for Mullen Automotive. If the buyout does indeed take place, or the positive news has a substantial effect on the company's prospects, it could mark the beginning of a new era of success for the struggling EV manufacturer.,;,; 2023-03-28 20:58:49]

[Tesla net income and earnings drop more than 20% from last year,;,; Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.  Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv  Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates  Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.  Automotive revenue, Tesla‚Äôs core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.  Tesla‚Äôs first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.  The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.  Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.  Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.   Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management‚Äôs consideration were seeking updates on the company‚Äôs trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company‚Äôs energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.  In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.  A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day‚Äôs drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.  According to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.  Tesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023.

[What could actually destabilize the stock market right now?,;,; I'll start. I want to read others opinions and ideas.      The general consensus right now is we're going through great weather in the stock market, smooth sailing. Maybe even a lot of confidence to be surfing the big waves. There are some things I see on the horizon.     1. The AI transition, although has the potential to do great things, is not being adopted so fast and in the pertient areas for actual economic growth. Because of this, AI as a tool for economic growth will plateu for a couple of years. Even though it's great, it has serious limitations right now and can't help whomever do something beyond their own capabilities to a degree that makes them as competent as an expert human being. Coding wise I can tell that much is certain. So I anticipate a disilusion coming from the AI expectations that are out there soon to bring the market down. Specially Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, etc. 2. There is a serious disconnect between low income and high income people. Low income being the vast majority. This is causing insecurity to rise and creep into areas where that wasn't a problem before. As a consequence... low income people will save instead of spend, and high income people will keep spending, creating an unrealistic measurement of how the economy is doing. This will keep inflation and the prices of goods from coming down, preventing economic growth to come from both low, medium and high income populations. Making the FED reconsider lowering rates as inflation numbers are updated. 3. Slowly but surely companies will let go of staff and the unemployment number will go up. Adding weight to the idea that raising rates is a no go for now. High unemployment levels can lead to decreased consumer spending, further slowing economic growth and complicating efforts to combat inflation. 4. Group monopolization: Tech companies and a relatively small group of companies are taking most of the pie. This imbalance will have an effect on the quality of goods being produced. Only a handful of options will be left to choose from and the will of entreprenours will be eroded from not being able to compete with companies who can keep financing the production of their products regardless of their bad quality. So a general lack of doing business motivation will permeate the air and consumers could attempt to simply stop purchasing and going the DIY route. 5. Europe in general seems to be in a hole. Swiss banks will have some turbulence in the near, medium term future; the debt of countries like Greece, Italy, Spain, etc will just start adding up and making the Euro currency to continue to lose value against other currencies. 6. Geopolitical tensions could escalate in different fronts and cause bottlenecks in production, transportation, travel, etc. You have the US-China relationship disputing technology and intellectual property rights and creating a competition with other countries for where goods are produced to be imported to the US. Escalation in tensions could bring about tariffs, sanctions, or retaliatory measures. There's also the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Israel-Gaza situation, Iran and Western countries over nuclear programs, other oil producing nations and the oil pricing situation. 7. US elections coming soon.     Considering this and the list below of what has triggered the US stock market to go down at least 20%, what do you see creeping up, potentially, as a catalyst for the market to flip to bear territory?     1. **1973-1974 Stock Market Crash**: Triggered by the oil crisis following the Yom Kippur War, when OAPEC (Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries) proclaimed an oil embargo. This, coupled with high inflation, stagnating economic growth (stagflation), and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, led to a severe bear market. 2. **Early 1980s Recession**: High inflation rates, exacerbated by oil price shocks and aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve under Paul Volcker to combat inflation, led to a severe recession and a significant market downturn in the early 1980s. 3. **Black Monday, 1987**: On October 19, 1987, stock markets around the world crashed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropping by 22% in a single day. Factors included trade deficits, rising interest rates, and overvaluation, but the crash was exacerbated by the widespread use of portfolio insurance and automated trading systems. 4. **Dot-com Bubble Burst, 2000-2002**: After years of speculative investment in internet-based companies, the bubble burst in 2000, leading to a significant market correction. Many tech companies saw their stock values plummet, leading to a broader market downturn and a mild recession. 5. **Global Financial Crisis, 2007-2009**: Triggered by the collapse of the housing bubble in the United States, leading to a crisis in subprime mortgages and a severe liquidity crunch. This crisis quickly spread globally, leading to significant declines in stock markets worldwide, bank failures, and a deep global recession. 6. **COVID-19 Pandemic, 2020**: The global outbreak of COVID-19 led to unprecedented economic disruption, as governments around the world imposed lockdowns and travel restrictions to combat the pandemic. The uncertainty and sudden stop in economic activity led to a sharp, but relatively short-lived, market downturn in March 2020.,;,; 2024-02-12 03:31:16]
[The tech industry's resilience: no signs of earnings recession despite market volatility,;,;  Last week, big U.S. tech companies began reporting their earnings for the first quarter of 2023. The results were generally ahead of estimates; for example, Alphabet revealed that its revenue grew, and that its rate of decline in earnings slowed down. Meta Platforms and others also put out earnings that were well ahead of expectations.  The results seen from U.S. tech companies last week call into question the narrative that we are in the midst of an ‚Äúearnings recession.‚Äù This year, analysts have been busy cutting corporate earnings estimates because of a belief that earnings will decline due to a poor economy. The actual results posted suggest otherwise. Most of the U.S. tech companies are posting positive revenue growth; a few are even growing their earnings.  ## Microsoft beats earnings  **Microsoft ($MSFT)** was a big winner in last week‚Äôs U.S. earnings bonanza. It not only beat expectations but also delivered positive growth in net income, which most of its peers were not able to do. In the first quarter (Q1), MSFT delivered the following:  * $52.86 billion in revenue, up 7% * $22.35 billion in operating income, up 9.7% * $18.3 billion in earnings, up 9.4% * $2.45 in diluted earnings per share (EPS), up 10.3% * A 34.92% profit margin  Overall, it was a very strong quarter. Microsoft easily beat estimates on both revenue and profit, and it guided for further strength in the second quarter. If Microsoft‚Äôs results are any indication, then Canadian tech companies might put out good earnings when they report this week.  ## What‚Äôs next for Canadian stocks?  This week, Canadian tech companies will begin reporting their first-quarter earnings. These releases will show investors whether the companies in question are growing, profitable, and, overall, worth investing in.  **Shopify ($SHOP)** is one Canadian tech stock that will be reporting soon. Its release comes out on May 4 ‚Äî the same day that Apple releases its earnings. Most likely, SHOP‚Äôs release will be overshadowed by Apple‚Äôs more closely watched earnings, but it will be notable in many ways itself.  For one thing, investors will want to know whether Shopify can keep up its high revenue growth. In 2022, Shopify‚Äôs revenue growth decelerated considerably, falling into the low teens. In the fourth quarter, it picked up a little, reaching 26%. Revenue deceleration has been a concern for Shopify, which was previously growing outrageously quickly (sales increased 86% in 2020), but lost its growth in 2022. If revenue growth picks up again, particularly if it exceeds the rate of growth analysts expect, then SHOP stock will likely rally.  Another thing investors will be watching in Shopify‚Äôs first-quarter earnings release is its profitability. Shopify was not profitable last quarter, partially because of losses on its stock portfolio. However, now, with tech stocks rising, Shopify may be able to become profitable again. It already has positive gross profit, but it‚Äôs suffering from the earnings impact of a weak stock market. There is a decent chance that Shopify will turn profitable in Q1, but it‚Äôs not guaranteed. Therefore, it‚Äôs something that investors will want to watch closely in SHOP‚Äôs Q1 earnings release.,;,; 2023-05-02 10:36:47]

The US President, Biden, delivered a speech on the banking system, stating that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has taken control of the assets of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank, and taxpayers will not incur any losses as the funds will come from insurance fund fees. He also announced that Congress and regulatory agencies will be required to strengthen bank regulations. HSBC Holdings acquired the UK subsidiary of Silicon Valley Bank for ¬£1, and the UK subsidiary's tangible assets are estimated to be around ¬£1.4 billion. The Dow Jones index will remove Signature Bank from some of its indices, and the MSCI Global Standard Index will remove SVB Financial Group.  Based on the Fed funds futures, it is most probable that the Fed will not increase interest rates any further. Traders predict that there is a 54% likelihood that the Fed will keep interest rates steady in March, and a 46% chance that it will raise them by 25 basis points. Moreover, traders anticipate that the Bank of England will only increase interest rates by 25 basis points.  **Trending Stocks**  Last week, the banking sector of the US stock market saw a continued decline, with small and medium-sized banks such as FRC, WAL, and PACW joining Silicon Valley Bank in experiencing a sell-off.

The US dollar index continued to fall from its high position, closing at 104.45.  The number of people filing for initial jobless claims in the US was lower than expected at 192,000, which suggests that the labor market is still strong despite large tech companies cutting jobs. This may be due to employers being hesitant to lay off workers during the pandemic, which has made it challenging to find labor. However, there are still 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person, indicating a tight labor market, and combined with high inflation, the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates next week. Nevertheless, the volatile financial market has created uncertainty for the economy.

[Investment plan for about 85 000$ USD over the coming year,;,; So I have been reading up on investing for a while now, painfully missing the amazing opportunity to buy last year. I want you to criticize, and help improve, my plan for entering my assets into stocks and ETFs over the coming year to two years.  I very strongly believe that AI will be even more transformative for society than what most expect, and will have greater implications for the overall economy than most think. I think that even buying tech related stocks, or for instance an ETF following the NASDAQ right now, near ATH, will almost definitely be a solid investment by 2030.  However I am also a bit unsure about the more short-medium term market and it would feel really bad to miss yet another great market for buying. I think I will keep a significant portion of my money outside the market for now.  I should also mention my country of residency is Norway so this has some implications for choices.  The plan:-Buy 100 shares of LYMS (**European UCITS ETF following NASDAQ** \- I think this will be better than QQQM long term due to tax benefits unique to holding European shares and funds in Norway) (Done)-Buy around 2 500 $ worth of **Norwegian dividend stocks** (Done)-Buy shares in **AMD** for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think they have a very good shot at taking AI processor market shares from Nvidia, and honestly I think I might even favor them over Nvidia in the long rund, though this is just a hunch from how good they are at developing efficient GPUs)-Buy shares in **Alphabet** ABEA for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Alphabet's DeepMind is further ahead of the curve when it comes to AI than has been fully let on by now)-Buy shares sin **Tesla Corp** TL0 for 1 000 - 2 000 $ (I think Tesla is a solid company that will benefit both from increasing electrification of the carpool and increased potential of AI - will probably be significantly higher valued in 2030)-Buy shares in **TSMC** TSM (Only one I will not buy in the European market, but I think their incredibly dominant position in semiconductor manufacturing will make this stock really really valueable over the next 10 years unless China invades Taiwan, which I think is a bit further into the future than that, although possible)-Move the remaining 400 000 - 580 000 $ to **bank account** I just opened with the highest interest rate offered in the Norwegian market (Have cash at hand if the market should go down in the relatively near future so I can actually benefit from it next time)  Some possible additions right now:-Considering Invesco **S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF** Acc P500 (Follows the S&amp;P 500 - with a soft landing seeming plausible and a land war raging in Europe, and Europe being further off getting its inflation under control, I think this might be a solid investment as confidence in, and the performance of, the US economy rises)-Considering Franklin FTSE **China UCITS ETF** FLXC (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, positions me to benefit if confidence in Chinese stocks rises - if the market becomes less afraid of Chinese government intervention this one will be severely undervalued. At the same time I don't want to buy specific Chinese stocks precisely because of said intervention)-Considering Franklin FTSE **India UCITS ETF** FLXI (Low cost ETF, broadens exposure, the Indian economy seems to be consistently experiencing solid growth and might be a pretty good long term investment)-Considering **Apple** APC (I think the price will probably be lower at some point within the next two years, but Apple is still a really solid company that probably will be valued significantly higher than today eventually)-Considering **Microsoft** MSF, **Meta** FB2A (Big tech companies that might stand to gain from AI without being completely reliant on it either)-Considering **Amazon** (Further from full price recovery than other tech companies, stands to gain massively if US economic activity and confidence rises, though as I expect interest rates to remain high might take some time)-**Berkshire Hathaway Class B** BRYN (They seem to know what they are doing, better inherent diversification than most of the other stocks here)-Considering **Palantir** PTX (So I can sell it when Reddit speculation leads it to new heights)-Considered **Nvidia** (FOMO)-Considered **IBM** and **Intel** as competitors to Nvidia and AMD, but upon looking into it I see AMD as the only real competitor to Nvidia for now. I don't think IBM is a terrible buy, I am not convinced Intel will be more valueable long term)  So what do you think - is my plan good? Should I buy any of the stocks I am considering? Should I drop some of the stocks I am currently planning to buy? Should I keep more or less money in reserve? Am I wrong about some of the companies?  Give me your reasons and tell my why I am wrong so I can make better decisions! :),;,; 2023-07-17 13:28:09]
[Time to reform public debt or the way to suppress world violence via public bond change,;,;  Dear Reddit Community,  In my article below, I describe my idea that help prevents or decrease government violence:  * wars against neighboring countries; * actions against nations via a suggested peculiar change in public bond terms.  Before sharing the suggestion with the community, I have tried to spread the idea between investment bankers, bond legal advisors, the ICMA, think tanks, investment funds, and the media. With few exceptions, they haven't cared or have ignored dozens of my e-mails.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  We live in the 21st century, and still today, the **world has many issues**:  * **Hot and cold conflicts** include Russia vs. Ukraine, Serbia vs. Kosovo, China vs. Taiwan, and Azerbaijan vs. Armenia. * **Suppression of democratic freedoms**, human rights abuse, and labor force discrimination. For instance, the Uyghur genocide, discrimination against LGBT, and abuse of migrant workers in Qatar.  Issues happen because governments have the resources to pursue mentioned policies. The majority of revenues come from tax collection. It is an involuntary process for taxpayers. Another significant part of income is supported by money borrowing. Usually, lenders voluntarily lend money to governments. According to the IMF, public debt accounts for 96% of the world's GDP. So debt plays a significant role in government activity.  Usually, sovereign bond investors worry only about the creditworthiness of the government. Even if investors worry about social issues, they can't control the public borrowers and make them accountable. However, there is little progress in it. Many investors are worried about particular issues, like pollution and women's rights. So this group of investors prefers ESG bonds. The latter directs government expenditures only to specific projects, constraining other ways of spending. In my opinion, it is not enough because ESG bonds are not a game-changer, ESG is just a part of today's climate-change agenda and lets governments extend their spending. More importantly, to constrain governments in their expenditures and actions.  Why do companies and governments issue green, sustainable, and social bonds if tomorrow one nation could kill another and human survival risk in a possible nuclear war arises?  I suggest **extending constraints to vanilla international government bonds**. It will **limit the government from financing conflicts or suppressing freedoms**.  For example, let's imagine investors want to constrain a state in its possibilities of waging wars against other aggressions or attempts of aggression.  All these **limitations can be described in a bond prospectus** as a **covenant** that I call an '**Event of conflict**'. **If an issuer violates the covenant, bonds** **become immediately puttable**, sanctioning the aggressive government and depriving its money. If a state issues the bond, it is an assurance that it will not start aggression. So the bond agreement encourages a country to be peaceful.  I call these bonds confliction prevention sovereign bonds or peace bonds.  I see **three ways the embedded Event of conflict covenant could trigger the puttable option**.  1. An **international organization** defined in the prospectus (for instance, it could be the UN) decides whether a country has waged a conflict. The organization is not contacting bondholders and has to do nothing with them. A trustee or bondholders should monitor the organization's decisions regarding the conflict. \[I know, a few trust the UN. The UN is just an instance, whose resolution triggers the specified put. Then the UN can't prevent or stops conflicts\] 2. Suppose there is reason to believe that an issuer is guilty of waging war. Further, a bond trustee of bonds (which issuer is possibly guilty of waging war) announces a **bondholders meeting**. If the majority (the term defined in the bond prospectus) of bondholders decide the issuer has violated the covenant, i.e., wage war, bonds become puttable. 3. It can be a **multilevel determination**, a combination, or a chain of bondholders' and/or international organizations' decisions. It depends on the conditions of bondholders and the issuer that should be agreed upon before the bond issuance. I will show below how it could be.  For example, we have country A and country B. Both have issued international bonds. While bonds remained outstanding, later the war between A and B began.  What will happen with the bonds of country A?  An international organization has defined that A attacked B.  1. If the Event of conflict covenant relies upon the international organization's decision, the bonds of A will become immediately puttable. All bondholders can demand early repairment at par. 2. Suppose the Event of conflict covenant is based on the bondholders' decision. In that case, the bond trustee of bonds of A announces a bondholders meeting.  There are two consequences:  * The majority decides that A violated the covenant. Hence, bond investors can force A to redeem their bonds before maturity. * The majority decides that A is not guilty and has not started the war. So put option has not been triggered.  1. A possible multilevel determination. An international organization proclaimed that A is guilty. That triggers a trustee to summon a bondholders meeting.  There are several conclusions:  * If the majority votes that A is guilty, all outstanding amounts of the bond become payable. * If the majority doesn't agree with the international organization's decision, only a minority of bondholders who voted that A is an aggressor could claim to redeem the debt immediately.  All these rigid limitations could stop governments from issuing such bonds. Understanding it, the 'Event of conflict' covenant could have a stick-and-carrot. I explained the stick earlier, so let's define the carrot. A **government could be able to finance the military only to defend against aggression** in its country. Thus, the covenant may have a postponement in case of a neighbor's attack. The delay will let the defending government stop paying the coupon and notional amount of the bonds until the end of the conflict preventing its bond default. This option can work well when the international organization determines an aggressor. Suppose bondholders have the right to decide about the covenant. In that case, bondholders will unlikely agree that their issuer is under attack and unlikely agree not to receive payments from it during the war.  Returning to our A and B. Suppose the global organization defined A as an aggressor, so its bonds become puttable. In contrast, bonds of B receive the postponement.  Another way to support a public borrower issuing these bonds is to regulate the interest rate of the bonds. If the conflict happens and the borrower is an aggressor, it will pay a much higher rate. If it is attacked, it will pay a lower or zero rate. This method can be combined or remain independent of the covenant described above.  **Ethically, the mentioned bond structure is much better than a plain vanilla sovereign bond when a country or group of countries impose sanctions on the issuer.** Usually, sanctions worsen a situation, bringing investors a loss of money; **in the case of described conflict prevention bonds, investors' voices matter.**  Do not forget that investors can additionally or independently define limitations for a state's internal policy to constrain government finance suppression of democratic freedoms.  It's been going on for more than a year of the Russian-Ukranian war. International bond investors would not have lost money if Russia had issued such bonds. They would have had an opportunity to redeem it earlier. Unlikely that in this scenario, the West would have sanctioned bond payments, and Russia would have come up with type C accounts paying in rubles for foreign-denominated loans. Agreeing to the Event of conflict during the bond issuance process, Russia would have redeemed its bonds earlier. Here I ask the investors to remember their portfolio losses and make a pause...Besides, Ukraine would not have needed to restructure its bonds if they had been issued with the postponement option.  In general, puttable bonds earn less interest than bonds without such options. Nevertheless, I estimate that bonds with the Event of conflict covenants triggering the put option would make less during tensions. Investors would shift from plain vanilla bonds to covenant-protected ones. In a peaceful situation, yields of plain vanilla and covenant-embedded bonds will be close.  Covenant-embedded bonds would let investors worry less about possible Russia-like defaults. In the wrong case, at least a sovereign borrower will repay a notional amount.  The idea could be naive, and I understand its flaws. I also estimate should it be issued, it would have 'peacewashing' examples (like greenwashing with ESG bonds). But nothing is perfect in the world. It is better to apply instruments limiting violence than do nothing.  Governments do not have incentives to issue such bonds constraining their shrewd policy. I am sure that **exacting bond buyers are essential**. Investors should bypass the plain vanilla bonds of troubled countries. In the end, undemocratic governments will agree with the terms knowing that public debt is the driving force to finance government expenditures. ESG development partly happened due to heavy promotion campaigns and investor demand for change. Also, tax incentives help investors to buy ESG bonds.

[Stock-picking dog beats AI in sniffing out winners,;,; "Artificial intelligence programmes are now capable of seducing lonely humans, writing Hollywood dialogue and even turning out passable imitations of Oasis songs.  One thing they cannot yet do, however, is pick a stock portfolio with any more success than a rescue dog can, if an experiment in Germany is anything to go by.  Freddy, an eight-year-old Maltese cross who selected shares by gravitating towards treats laid out on slips of paper, trounced a set of recommendations from ChatGPT, achieving nearly four times the returns delivered by the AI over the course of six weeks.  Since the mid-19th century financial theorists have debated whether skill and knowledge are really any better guide than the vagaries of chance when placing bets on the markets. In various tests schoolchildren, animals and darts carelessly flung at a wall have outperformed human experts.  In the 2000s the Chicago Sun-Times hired as its star investment columnist a capuchin monkey called Adam Monk, who chose stocks by circling items in the business pages with a red felt-tip pen. More often than not he beat leading financial analysts.  This time, however, the German magazine WirtschaftsWoche pitted Freddy against an AI in one of the first contests of its kind, with each given a notional war chest of ‚Ç¨19,000 to spend on shares in 15 companies.  While ChatGPT is not set up to issue specific investment suggestions, it volunteered to assemble a ‚Äúdiversified portfolio of stocks [in firms] that demonstrate solid accounts, have growing sales, remain profitable and have a high market capitalisation‚Äù.   Its relatively conservative picks, ranging from dominant tech corporations such as Apple and Amazon to well-known consumer-focused businesses such as McDonald‚Äôs and CocaCola, yielded a respectable but unspectacular 3.5 per cent.  Freddy, on the other hand, perhaps inured to the cut-throat caprices of life by his youth as a stray dog on the streets of Istanbul, bet heavily on energy, AI and technological hardware. While this Warren Wooffett‚Äôs forays into bitcoin and oil went a little sour, punts on Nvidia, a high-end chipmaker, and Uniper, a troubled German energy conglomerate, paid off handsomely.  His total return of 13.5 per cent outclassed not only the AI but also the majority of normal investment funds.  ‚ÄúHe did a great job,‚Äù Ali Masarwah, director of the Envestor fund platform, told the magazine. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather trust Freddy than the AI with my money.‚Äù,;,; 2023-07-11 08:00:21]

[Futures muted, key inflation data on tap,;,;    U.S. stock index futures were muted on Monday at the beginning of a week packed with economic data points, including a key inflation reading that will be scrutinized for signs of whether the Federal Reserve is succeeding in its attempt to cool prices.  At 5:06 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 33 points, or 0.1%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis were up 1 points, or 0.02%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 15.5 points, or 0.12%.     U.S. stock indexes staged a late-week rally on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting its biggest one-day percentage gain since Jan. 6 after upbeat results from Apple Inc and U.S. jobs data highlighting a resilient labor market.  Focus will be on the Labor Department's inflation data on Wednesday, which is expected to show the consumer price index (CPI) likely climbed 0.4% in April, after gaining 0.1% in March, while excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI likely increased 0.4% last month.  Data on producer prices, weekly jobless claims, and on consumer sentiment are all lined up through the week.  These data points will help investors not only gauge whether the Fed's aggressive tightening cycle - including its most recent 25 basis point hike last week - is working towards tamping down inflation but also, if fears of stagflation are founded.  "Market expectation of cuts already in the summer are based on a too-optimistic forecast of a quick disinflation," Paolo Zanghieri Senior economist at Generali Investments wrote in a note. "Anyway, inflation stabilizing at 3% would not be enough for the Fed to start easing rates."  Regional bank shares extended gains in premarket, with PacWest Bancorp jumping 13.5% after the company announced quarterly dividend. Peers, Western Alliance Bancorp, Comerica Inc and Zions Bancorp rose between 2.8% and 4.9%.  Shares of such regional lenders rebounded on Friday from declines tied to the collapse of First Republic Bank.  American Airlines Group Inc rose 1.9% after J.P. Morgan raised its rating on the company's stock to "overweight" from "neutral", while Southwest Airlines Co fell 1.3% as JPM downgraded its stock to "neutral" from "overweight".

[Elon Musk‚Äôs latest AI Project (TruthGPT) and Understanding New AI Regulations - The Case for USD, SOXL, UBOT, and GGLL,;,; Hey everybody, my name‚Äôs Christian.  In November 2022, ChatGPT was released to the public, igniting mass interest in AI and bringing to the forefront of public discussion both the fantastic things AI can do to help the world, but also the potential for undesired consequences in a world where AI plays a significant role in the day to day life. Today I am discussing some recent events surrounding AI, including ChatGPT, new regulations and sentiment surrounding AI advancement, the ways companies are integrating the technology, and potential ways to profit from AI development and adoption, mainly through semiconductor and AI-related companies and funds.   &amp;#x200B;  **ChatGPT**  In November 2022, OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public based on the GPT-3.5 AI foundational large language models. Immediately, users were impressed with ChatGPTs ability to provide detailed and human-like answers in a wide range of knowledge domains and with a high degree, but not perfect, accuracy.   Following the release, ChatGPT has become the fastest-growing consumer application in history, amassing 100 million monthly and 13 million daily users by January of 2023, just two months after release. Conversely, Tiktok took nine months to reach 100 million monthly users, while Instagram took 2.5 years to achieve the 100 million monthly user mark.   &amp;#x200B;  **Concerns and Regulations around AI**  Yet, before the rapid adoption of AI technologies, spurred mainly by ChatGPT and related products, regulators worldwide have been concerned about AI and its possible risks to the public. In October of 2022, the Biden administration released a document titled the ‚ÄúAI Bill of Rights‚Äù to lay a framework for how AI technology should interact with the public in the modern age. The bill was based around five core pillars, designed to empower the American people to expect better from their AI tools, and demand better from AI technology producers, to ensure their users' safety, freedom, and security. This bill has been effective in its goal, as other regulators have recently passed regulations surrounding AI technology.   In the past few months, the Biden administration has pushed for further regulation in the AI space to protect children, with increased pressure on accountability measures for developing and creating a certification process to ensure AI technology is tested before its deployment.   The EU has developed its own regulations on AI development and utilization called the ‚ÄúAI Act.‚Äù Like the regulations in the US, the AI Act aims to steer the development of powerful AI in a human-centric, safe, and trustworthy direction. Furthermore, this act seeks to ensure AI is safe for its users, transparent in its training and answering protocols, and fair along every step of its development, including creation, training, and development.   Another significant development in the AI regulation arena is an Open Letter written by leaders in the AI space calling for halting AI development on March 22, 2023. This letter is co-signed and supported by prominent names such as Andrew Yang, Steve Wozniak (Co-Founder of Apple), and Elon Musk, among many other notable names. The letter's content warns that AI systems with human levels of intelligence pose a significant risk to society and humanity as a whole, risks that should be addressed and planned for. It calls for the complete halt of AI development for the next six months to develop and implement protocols and regulations to oversee and track AI firms to ensure human safety and the safe development of further AI technology. The letter summarizes that AI may be a wonderful development for the benefit of humanity, but proper regulations need to be in place before further advancements are made.   &amp;#x200B;  **TruthGPT**  Following Elon Musk‚Äôs signing of the Open Letter, released March 22, 2023, Elon Musk, in an interview with Tucker Carlson, announced that he is working on ‚ÄúTruthGPT,‚Äù an alternative to ChatGPT that claims to be a ‚Äúmaximum truth-seeking AI,‚Äù that will be ‚Äúunlikely to annihilate humans.‚Äù   This move from Elon Musk isn‚Äôt coming out of nowhere. Elon Musk has extensive experience with AI technologies, as he co-founded OpenAi, the company that built ChatGPT. Elon Musk built the company with its current CEO Sam Altman in 2015 before leaving the company in 2018. More recently, Elon Musk has been a vocal critic of ChatGPT, claiming that OpenAI has trained the AI to lie and saying that ChatGPT has become a close source, a for-profit organization closely allied with Microsoft.   The combination of Elon Musk‚Äôs AI experience with OpenAi, the cosigning of the Open Letter calling for a halt to AI development, and finally, his course reversal with the announcement of his own AI suggests that Elon Musk is bullish on AI. Elon Musk‚Äôs proponency of AI supports the idea that AI is here to stay and represents a strong bullish indicator for large corporations to adopt AI technology into their existing profits.   &amp;#x200B;  **Samsung, Microsoft, and Google**   It‚Äôs not just me that thinks large companies are deeply interested in AI technologies to implement into their products to gain an advantage over the competitors and steal market share. Recently, Samsung, which ships over 200 million phones per year, stated that there are seriously considering dropping Google as the default search engine in their phones in favor of Microsoft‚Äôs Bing search engine. This is primarily due to Microsoft‚Äôs investment of $10 Billion into OpenAi in January and the implementation of OpenAi‚Äôs ChatGPT technology into its search engine Bing. The deal between Samsung and Google is worth $3 Billion and is deeply concerning to Google, which has a similar agreement with Apple worth $20 Billion, which is up for renewal this year.   The conflict between Samsung and Microsoft versus Google represents the most significant threat to Google‚Äôs search engine dominance in 25 years. In response, Google has announced the development of their own AI-powered search engine, as well as implementing AI into their existing products. Google has been working with AI for a long time with its DeepMind lab since it acquired the British lab in 2014. While the DeepMind lab is considered one of the best AI labs in the world, Google has been tentative about implementing AI  into their products as Google has found it to be prone to generating false and biased answers.   Yet with the pressure placed on it by Microsoft‚Äôs Bing search engine, Google released ‚ÄúBard,‚Äù its own AI-powered search engine, to mixed success and reviews. Regardless of the success of the Bard release, Google will need to demonstrate that it is as powerful, competent, and modern as its competitors to maintain the dominance of the search engine market share it has enjoyed.   &amp;#x200B;  **Summary**  ChatGPT pushed the world into full-scale interest and adoption of AI technology, and thus the public will have to deal with the implications of this event, both positive and negative. Regulators and public figures have pushed caution and slowing of advancement and adoption of AI technology. However, Elon Musk‚Äôs course reversal and the conflict between significant technology companies suggest a slow and cautious adoption of the technology may be unlikely. Thus, assuming AI technology is here to stay, how can you position your investments to profit from this shift?  &amp;#x200B;  **Actionable Advice**  \*\*\*I am not a CFA, nor is this content aimed to be financial advice; it simply serves to provide my opinions on market conditions, opportunities, and strategies that interest me. You should do your own research before making any investment decisions.\*\*\*  Advancements in AI technology primarily come from improvements in software technology. However, AI technology runs on physical hardware with many components, like any other software. Suppose we assume that AI technology will likely increase in demand. In that case, we can see prices in stocks and funds that supply computer hardware, particularly semiconductors (the major component of CPUs and GPUs), and are involved with AI technology to experience significant price increases. The main stocks that I see benefiting from increased development and adoption of AI are USD, SOXL, UBOT, and GGLL.   **USD** is a 2x leverage fund that tracks the Dow Jones semiconductor index, aiming to provide 2x the daily returns of the underlying index. As such, it will see the most price movement if companies involved in the semiconductor index see price changes. Over the past month, the stock is down around 5%, while over the past six months, it's up over 80%.  **SOXL** is a 3x leveraged fund tacking the ICE semiconductor index, consisting of the 30 largest semiconductor companies in the US. As a higher leveraged fund, it hasn‚Äôt performed as well as the 2x leveraged fund due to choppy price action in semiconductors over the past few weeks. Additionally, like USD, the stock price will change following changes in the price of semiconductor manufacturers. SOXL is down 20% in the past month while up 60% in the past six months.  **UBOT** is a 2x leveraged fund tracking the performance of the Indxx Global Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Thematic Index. As such, this stock will move when companies involved in Robotics and AI see price changes. UBOT has dropped 2% in the past month, while it has increased 49% in the past 6 months.   **GGLL** is a 1.5x leveraged stock of Google. The reason I chose a fund tracking Google versus one that follows Microsoft or Apple is that I believe Google has the most opportunity for growth with their AI technology, and I think they have the highest chance of success in the space, which will consequently increase their stock price.  After their disappointing results with Bard, public opinion has moved slightly against Google regarding AI tech. However, as the dominant player in search engines, Google will be highly motivated to ensure they stay there, doing whatever is necessary to ensure they don‚Äôt slip from their current spot. Additionally, Google‚Äôs DeepMind lab, being one of the best AI labs in the world, means that if Google directs that experience toward the development of building the best search engine possible, I think the AI experience from the lab will allow Google to develop and deploy a search engine that matches or surpasses Microsofts offering in the form of Bing. Thus I believe Google will likely succeed in ensuring its dominance in the search engine field by more effectively developing and implementing AI technology than its competitors, resulting in higher company valuations and stock prices.   Ultimately, all these stocks are primed for significant increases in the coming months as AI development and adoption continue, regardless of the concerns and regulations being put in place by global governments.   Well, that's all I have for today. Please let me know your thoughts on these news events and my stock analysis in the comments.   Thanks for reading!  Christian Zahl,;,; 2023-05-02 14:37:43]

[CNCX Concentrix stock - Undervalued?,;,; Unemployed and lost but want to see if I am any good with analyzing stocks. Fundamental stock analysis of decent size companies (no penny stocks or crazy tech companies); I have no idea in technical analysis. I am thinking if I am any good I could do some YouTube videos on some of the stocks most requested by the community here and help people make money. I will be using conservative numbers wherever I think it is possible.  Concentrix CNCX is a traditional CX call center service that has many clients like Apple etc. **Three of the most important factors for analyzing stocks is History, Competitors, and Outlook -- so I will be trying to put my take on it and make it short as possible.**  **Competitors:**  |As of 2022|Teleperformance TLPFY|TTEC Holdings TTEC|Majorel MAJ.AS|Concentrix CNCX| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |||||| |Revenue|8.2 bn|2.5 bn|2.1 bn|9.8 bn| |Gross Profit|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A| |Operating Margin|994 M (12.2%)|250 M (10%)|210 M (10%)|980 M (10%)| |Assets|4.4 bn|1.1 bn|1 bn|4 bn| |Liabilities|(5.2 bn)|(1.5 bn)|(1 bn)|(8 bn)| |Asset - Liabilities|(800 M)|(400 M)|0|(4 bn)| |Enterprise Value|10 bn (10 times)|2.5 bn (10 times)|2.1 bn (10 times)|9.8 bn| |Market Value|9.2 bn|2.1 bn|2.1 bn|5.8 bn| |Should be Market Price|158|44|22|115| |Actual Price|162|35|29|83| |Difference|N/A|\+25%|\-25%|\+40%|  **History:**  The biggest competitor to Concentrix is Teleperformance. So comparing the history of Teleperformance should tell you what the normal range of valuation should be for Concentrix.  ||2021|2020|2019|2018|2017| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Revenue|8.73 bn|8.06 bn|7.05 bn|6 bn|5.08| |Gross Profit|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A| |Operating Margin|870M (10%)|800M (10%)|700M (10%)|600M (10%)|500M (10%)| |Assets|5 bn|4.5 bn|4 bn|3.3 bn|2.7 bn| |Liabilities|(5.9 bn)|(5.7 bn)|(4.9 bn)|(4.2 bn)|(3 bn)| |Asset - Liabilities|(1 bn)|(1.2 bn)|(1 bn)|(1 bn)|(300M)| |Actual Enterprise Value|23 bn|20bn|16bn|11 bn|8.3 bn| |Actual Market Value|22bn|19bn|15bn|10 bn|8 bn| |EV/Revenue|2.75|2.5|2.25|2|1.6| |Average|2.22|2.22|2.22|2.22|2.22|  **Outlook:**  Concentrix is acquiring Webhelp (private) and becoming the biggest CX provider. They are neck in neck with Teleperformance who acquired Majorel for 1.5 times sales to Enterprise Value - means they all feel prices are low enough for consolidation in the industry.  Looking at the first table it looks like Concentrix is undervalued by 40% on already depressed numbers of EV/Revenue as average EV/Revenue for Teleperformance has been more like 2 historically. So prices will be expected to reach $120 on just 1 times EV/Revenue.  But lets say if we give it a more reasonable number of 1.5-2 EV/Revenue then stock price will be expected to reach $160.  Let me know if this looks good and any comments/upvotes will be appreciated.

[$META earnings: time to buckle up,;,; Meta Platforms Inc ($ META), formerly known as Facebook, had an impressive Q1 2023 earnings report, beating analysts' expectations and showing strong growth in several key areas. As a result, the company's shares gapped up on Thursday's open to the tune of 15%. It was both a remarkable result and a remarkable response, which bodes well for the tech company as a whole.  How both Google and Apple had done just enough to keep the tech industry buoyant with their earnings beats, but this from Meta is a whole other story. The share price action suggests that the positive momentum could continue in the coming days, so get excited. It's a similar gap to what they experienced at the end of Jan, and it could be looking at the start of another fresh multi-month rally.  ## Smashing Expectations  Digging into the numbers, the company's GAAP EPS came in at $2.20, well ahead of the consensus estimate of $1.97. Meanwhile, the company's revenue of $28.6 billion also beat expectations and showed growth of 2.7% year on year. It wasn't quite the double-digit growth results of yesteryear, but like their tech titan peers yesterday, it will be more than good enough for now.  But the recovery story has been truly one for the ages. Since last November, Meta shares have tacked on 175%, including this morning's jump. And the cherry on top? Well, they're still only barely halfway on their journey to undoing all of last year's selloff.  The past quarter's numbers were driven largely by growth in the company's advertising business, which crushed analyst expectations and surprised investors. Meta's user base also continued to grow, with daily active users (DAUs) reaching 2.04 billion. The company also noted that its efforts to increase ad efficiency had paid off, with the average price per ad increasing by 22% year-on-year. In addition, management saw fit to issue forward guidance that also came in hot, with Looking Ahead  In addition to its advertising business, Meta's other business units also showed strong growth. Looking ahead, Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, highlighted the company's focus on privacy and building a metaverse, a shared virtual space that's expected to be the next big thing in social media. The company is also investing in its messaging platforms, such as WhatsApp and Messenger, to drive further growth and revenue.  Meta strong earnings report is likely to have a positive impact on the broader tech market, particularly other social media companies. Shortly after the market opened on Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 index was up a cool 1.25%, with most commentators thanking Meta for the boost. Those of us on the sidelines know that analysts are remaining bullish on Meta's prospects for the near and medium term. MarketBeat's MarketRank Forecast has a Moderate Buy rating on the stock, based on 40 Buy recommendations out of a total of 49 market ratings.  Some price targets to be kept in mind include the Royal Bank of Canada's $285, Deutsche Bank's $290 and Guggenheim's $320. The latter of these is pointing to an upside of more than 30%, and that's including this morning's jump.  So get excited, both for Meta and tech as a whole. Their strong earnings report is a positive sign for the company and will reinforce those from their peers yesterday.,;,; 2023-04-28 07:16:54]
[SP500 Futures TA for 8/2/23,;,;  *I share my plan for educational purposes and discussion and it is not intended as trade recommendations or ideas.*  ***Recap***: In the plan for today I wrote that *‚Äúa sustained breakout above* ***4609-20*** *would signal that a new trend leg is developing‚Äù*. This level was tested but not taken out overnight and so what looked like a potential breakout at yesterday‚Äôs close again failed and kept the market in a tight range.¬†  In said in the plan that I 'm viewing **4596** support. In the premarket session, the market tested below this level and recovered it, and I got long just after the market opened today. I exited the majority of the trade at **4609**, the next resistance level from the plan, and the last contract was taken out at breakeven. For as tight a range as the market is in, I‚Äôm happy to get a win at all. The market proceeded to retest **4596** and even towards the other support level from yesterday‚Äôs educational section, but really didn‚Äôt go anywhere.  ***Balance/Trend***: The market has been in the balance area since July 18; I have defined this region as **4559-4609**, and added an additional level at **4620** to capture the drift we‚Äôve seen at the highs when the market has tried breaking above 4609. Since Friday, this has tightened further and there is no predominant recent trend. Core trends, ones that span weeks or months or more, are all still pointing up.¬†  ***Analysis***: Today‚Äôs action was more of what we‚Äôve come to expect in balanced markets and indeed is the reason why I always track the balance and trend in the section above. In yesterday‚Äôs newsletter, I highlighted the fact that the market continues to balance within the upper distribution of the Friday profile and today‚Äôs low keeps that bit of analysis relevant.  In the near term, I would watch for bulls to hold the market above **4589** (and **4582** at the lowest) to keep their near-term momentum . A failure here raises the odds that the market moves back to the balance area lows at **4559**. Whatever happens though, it‚Äôs clearly a choppy consolidation until some sort of trend resumes (above **4609-20** or below **4559**). With jobs figures due the rest of this week and Apple and Amazon reporting on Thursday, volatility could/should be just ahead.¬†  ***Plan***  * There are several support levels that I‚Äôm watching that are bunched together, as they often are in these environments: **4573**, **4579-82, 4589, 4596**. These were all covered in greater detail elsewhere, but given their proximity and the choppy conditions, trading these could be very difficult. As usual, I am following my guidelines to get confirmation and exit the trade at the next level * One potential support that I‚Äôm watching is at **4562**, a spot where the market previously saw strong buying. Ideally the market would test **4559** first and bounce from there for me to get long at this level * If the market were to lose the balance area lows, I would be hesitant to trade counter to that trend, though a spot to watch for a support trade would be at **4542-45** * Other potential support levels are **4529**, **4494-97**, **4479, 4472**, **4466** * Again, the market would really need to clear **4620** to convince me of a breakout, and even then I rarely chase them.

[Taiwan chip export plunges, China still lags amid U.S. restriction,;,; Taiwan‚Äôs exports of integrated circuit chips to China fell for a fourth month in February as Washington-Beijing tensions simmer and demand for electronics continues to cool down.  &amp;#x200B;    The self-governing island‚Äôs exports of IC chips, which are pivotal components of electronic appliances, computers, and smartphones, to China mainland and Hong Kong dropped 31.3% from a year earlier. It was the worst decline since 2009, even topping January‚Äôs 27.1% fall.¬†According to data compiled by Bloomberg, China's market share of Taiwan-made chips plummeted to the lowest level since February 2019 due to the nearly one-third decline.  &amp;#x200B;    Taiwan is the world‚Äôs largest producer of cutting-edge chips, and demand for the advanced technology that has bolstered its economy has dropped rapidly. The fall is hastening as Taiwan comes in as a geopolitical hotspot.  As China attempts to develop its own advanced technologies, the US has taken steps to prevent the world‚Äôs second-largest economy from doing so. In January, the Biden administration reached an agreement with the Netherlands and Japan to restrict exports of some advanced chipmaking machinery to China.  Taiwan-based [TSMC]( is regarded as the ‚Äúsacred mountain protecting the island‚Äù because of its economic importance. Last year, the semiconductor giant announced its second chip plant in Arizona with an increased $40 billion investment for further partnership with the U.S..  The semiconductor giant‚Äôs founder Morris Chang said last Thursday that he supported U.S. efforts to slow China's advances in the semiconductor industry. [TSMC]( is the most valuable listed company in Asia and a major Apple Inc. supplier.   &amp;#x200B;    "There's no question in my mind that, in the chip sector, globalization is dead. Free trade is not quite that dead, but it's in danger," Morris Chang said, speaking at an event.  As Taiwan, the island that China views as its territory, plays a more ‚Äúrebellious‚Äù role between U.S. and China, especially in flaed-up competition for advanced technology, Beijing turns to give domestic chipmakers new founding access after a sweeping graft probe in the chip industry last year.  &amp;#x200B;    China-based Huawei, Chipmakers Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC), Hua Hong Semiconductor, and other equipment suppliers will be among those benefiting from the policy shift, according to Financial Times‚Äô report.  ‚ÄúThe Chinese government will subsidize these companies to produce and deploy localized chipmaking tools without any funding cap, just in order to overcome US restrictions,‚Äù said one person with direct knowledge of the policy shift.  China needs to accelerate the development of homegrown replacements in face of the U.S. and its allies‚Äô restrictions, but it would not be an easy task. [TSMC]( Chang said China's chip manufacturing technology lags that of Taiwan by "at least five or six years", although Beijing is pouring billions into supporting its chip sector.

[Magnificent 7 and friends contributed 75% of S&amp;P 500 gains,;,; = just copy and paste for sharing, some charts are missing =  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 days that moved the stock market the most in 2023  [  &amp;#x200B;  The U.S. stock market was heading into year-end with a head of steam, pushing the S&amp;P 500 index ever closer to record territory. In a look back at 2023, data provider FactSet took a look at the biggest daily market moves in both directions.  &amp;#x200B;  It‚Äôs an interesting rundown, with the biggest moves attributed to the performance of megacap tech stocks, a spring bout of banking turbulence and, of course, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs inflation battle, noted FactSet‚Äôs Torstein Jakobsen, in a blog post.  &amp;#x200B;  The 10 top performing days for the S&amp;P 500 SPX contributed to an aggregate increase of 18.35% for the index, while the bottom 10 days accounted for a collective decrease of 16.2%.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 was up 24.4% for the year to date through Tuesday‚Äôs close, ending less than 0.5% away from its Jan. 3, 2022, record finish. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has gained 13.3% in 2024, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP has soared 44%.  &amp;#x200B;  Through Dec. 22, the S&amp;P 500 saw 132 positive days and 113 negative. Meanwhile, the market was more calm in 2023, with just 63 trading days posting a price swing of more than 1% through Dec. 20, not far off the 10-year average of 59. Last year, with the S&amp;P 500 sliding more than 19%, the index saw 122 trading days with moves up or down of more than 1%.  &amp;#x200B;  Interestingly, the two biggest moves came early and within about six weeks of each other. The S&amp;P 500 soared 2.28% on Jan. 6, after December jobs data offered signs that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate hikes were effectively cooling the economy without triggering a recession, Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  That didn‚Äôt mean interest rate-hike worries were vanquished. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2% on Feb. 21, marking its worst performance of the year, largely due to apprehensions about further interest-rate increases, Jakobsen wrote.  &amp;#x200B;  Fed policy and inflation concerns remained central to market sentiment throughout the year, influencing six out of the 12 most volatile days, FactSet found.  &amp;#x200B;  Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell from a 9.1% peak last year to 6.4% by January 2023, and down to 3.2% by October. That allowed the Fed to slow the pace of rate hikes, delivering four, quarter-point increaes in 2023 and pausing after July.  &amp;#x200B;  The strategy ‚Äúindicates the Fed‚Äôs measured approach in moderating policy to stabilize the economy while mitigating market disruption,‚Äù Jakobsen said.  &amp;#x200B;  The second worst performing day of the year came on March 9 when the S&amp;P 500 endured a significant sell-off, declining by 1.85%. This downturn was largely attributed to growing concerns over the value of U.S. banks‚Äô bond portfolios, exacerbated by SVB Financial Group‚Äôs announcement of a $1.75 billion common equity and $500 million convertible preferred offering.  &amp;#x200B;  SVB soon collapsed, sparking what some termed a ‚Äúmini‚Äù banking crisis, exacerbated by the collapse of Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse, sparked fears of an immediate credit crunch that could send the economy into recession. Fears that were soon seen as overblown.  &amp;#x200B;  Of course, no discussion of 2023 is complete without a look at the extremely lopsided performance of the market, characterized by the so-called Magnificent 7 megacap tech stocks ‚Äî Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.78%  , Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -0.47%,  [Amazon.com]( Inc. AMZN, 0.16%,  Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.16%,  Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.01%,  Tesla Inc. TSLA, 1.97%,  and Meta Platforms Inc.  META, 0.56%.  &amp;#x200B;  See: The Magnificent 7 dominated 2023. Will the rest of the stock market soar in 2024?  &amp;#x200B;  Despite a broadening of the rally at year-end, the biggest names have accounted for a remarkable chunk of the rally, leaving much of the market behind.  &amp;#x200B;  The S&amp;P 500 saw its third-largest move of the year on April 27, climbing 1.96% after a round of robust earnings from big tech companies. Meta led the rally, surging 14% following its earnings that exceeded expectations, further helped by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  In the chart below, FactSet takes a look at a slightly broader top 10 contributors, which includes both classes of Alphabet stock, Broadcom Inc. AVGO, 0.11% and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. LLY, 0.83%, showing their weight in the performance is extraordinarily high:  &amp;#x200B;  The top 10 accounted for 75% of the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs weighted average return, well above the 39% average from 2014 to 2022, Jakobsen noted.  &amp;#x200B;  Nvidia with a rise of 229%, has been the standout, contributing 2.77% to the S&amp;P 500‚Äôs overall return, he wrote, with the company‚Äôs success attributed largely to its data centers business, which benefited from demand for advanced artificial-intelligence infrastructure.,;,; 2023-12-27 15:52:27]

[Bank stocks shoot higher as job data Bolsters Markets,;,; PacWest and Western Alliance, the banks at the center of the latest phase of the crisis, recouped a chunk of earlier losses, as robust economic data also heartened investors.     A group of regional bank stocks that came under severe pressure this week, stoking fears of a spiraling banking crisis, surged on Friday, at least partly alleviating those worries.  The rebound came as the market was also bolstered by data on hiring that was deemed strong enough to soften concerns about a recession without prompting the Federal Reserve to tighten the screws on the economy further.  PacWest soared over 80 percent, after falling over 50 percent on Thursday. Western Alliance‚Äôs share price rose almost 50 percent, also recouping a chunk of its drop the day before.  The relief rally helped to lift the broader market, with the S&amp;P 500 up 1.9 percent, its first day of gains in May.   Still, the gains weren‚Äôt enough to reverse another bruising week for the nation‚Äôs midsize banks. The seizure and sale of First Republic to JPMorgan Chase on Monday was presented by Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan‚Äôs chief executive, ushering in the end of the crisis that began in March with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.   However, Mr. Dimon added that there ‚Äúmay be another smaller‚Äù bank to run into trouble. Shortly thereafter, a fresh bout of pressure clobbered the stocks of smaller lenders like PacWest and Western Alliance, which tried to reassure investors that their deposit bases were stable and that the market moves were unrelated to their financial health.  Even with Friday‚Äôs bounce, PacWest remained set to end the week having lost nearly half its market value. Western Alliance ended roughly a quarter below where it started the week. The S&amp;P 500 ended the week 0.8 percent lower.  After trading ended on Friday, the Federal Reserve released data showing that deposits at commercial banks in the United States declined slightly in the week that ended April 26, falling to $17.17 trillion from $17.18 trillion in the week before. At domestically chartered banks, though, they ticked higher ‚Äî to $15.96 trillion from $15.94 trillion previously. In either case, the data showed deposits had stabilized following much more sizable declines in March and early April.  Concern over the fate of the regional lenders was further relieved by fresh data on Friday that showed a robust labor market, with the pace of new hiring in April coming in stronger than expected and workers still achieving elevated wage gains.  Despite the strong numbers for April, downward revisions to data from earlier months show the longer-term trend of a slowing labor market persisted, and investors still expect Fed policymakers to pause on raising interest rates when they next meet in June.  Elsewhere, oil prices rose, often a reflection of a brighter outlook for the global economy. They, too, bounced higher following a sharp decline earlier in the week.  A further tailwind for the market came from Apple, which reported better-than-expected profits for the first quarter, helping push its share price nearly 5 percent higher on Friday. Because of the size of the tech behemoth, its moves have more of an effect on the S&amp;P 500 than any company in the index.  Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, has said that it is possible to slow the economy enough to stem inflation without tipping it into recession. Arguably, Friday‚Äôs employment data supports that notion of a so-called soft landing.   Nonetheless, some investors remain on edge, even after Friday‚Äôs bounce. The strong data nudged higher the possibility of a rate increase in June.  The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changing interest-rate expectations, also rose, climbing 0.16 percentage points to 3.9 percent ‚Äî a big move for an asset that typically changes by hundredths of a percentage point each day, and a sign that investors think interest rates could stay higher for longer.,;,; 2023-05-06 06:52:58]
[GLOBAL MARKETS-Shares rise, dollar weakens on bank sector fears,;,;  SINGAPORE, May 5 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose, the dollar eased and gold hovered near record highs on Friday, as investors worried that a rout in shares of U.S. regional lenders earlier this week could herald more trouble for the banking sector.   MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.44% higher and was on course to snap its two-week losing streak as investors bet that the Federal Reserve may soon have to cut interest rates.  As investors flocked to safe haven assets, spot gold moved closer to its record high and the yen appeared set for its first weekly gain in nearly a month.  Shares of U.S. regional banks sank this week after the collapse of First Republic Bank, bringing back worries of a widening banking sector crisis that began with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March.  "There is increasing nervousness about the banking problems in the U.S. and I fear that the central banks are going too far," said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital in Sydney.  "There seems to be a view among central banks that they've got it under control, whereas the means that they've used to try and control it, are actually creating more problems."  Wall Street ended lower on Thursday after Los Angeles-based PacWest Bancorp's move to explore strategic options deepened fears about the health of U.S. lenders as pressure grows on regulators to take more steps to shore up the country's banking sector.     Shares of another regional lender Western Alliance pared losses after plummeting by nearly 60% on a Financial Times report that it was exploring strategic options. Western Alliance denied the report.  "There is a risk that we enter a self-fulfilling cycle of negative sentiment leading to lower stock prices, higher funding costs and deposit flight," said James Rutherford, head of European equities at Federated Hermes.  The turmoil in the banking sector comes as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday but hinted that its marathon hiking cycle may be ending.  Markets are pricing for the Fed to stand pat at its next meeting in June before embarking on rate cuts from July, according to CME FedWatch tool.  "There is plenty of data between now and the June 14 Fed meeting, with what happens in the banking sector being more key at the moment," Saxo Markets strategists said.     U.S. nonfarm payroll data for April will be released later in the global day.  European stock markets looked set for a higher open, with Eurostoxx 50 futures up 0.42%, German DAX futures up 0.39% and FTSE futures up 0.33%.  On Thursday, the European Central Bank raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.25% and signalled that more tightening would be needed to tame inflation. Markets though pared back their expectations on how much further rates would rise.  Nick Rees, FX market analyst at Monex Europe, said it was clear that the ECB is now in the home stretch when it comes to monetary tightening, despite ECB President Christine Lagarde's attempt to steer markets away from this narrative.  China shares fell 0.71%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up 0.6%.  China's service activity grew for a fourth straight month in April, a private-sector survey showed on Friday, as businesses continued to benefit from the country's reopening, although expansion slowed slightly.  E-mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.35% after Apple Inc's results beat expectations, helped by better-than-expected iPhone sales and notable inroads in India and other newer markets.  In the currency market, the Japanese yen strengthened 0.20% to 134.04 per dollar, on course for its first weekly gain in nearly a month.  Sterling was last trading at $1.26095, up 0.27% on the day, having touched an 11-month high of $1.26150. The euro firmed 0.27% to $1.10435.  Against a basket of currencies, the dollar eased 0.170% to 101.17.  Meanwhile, spot gold eased 0.1% to $2,049.68 an ounce, hovering close to its all-time high of $2,072.49.  U.S. crude rose 0.77% to $69.09 per barrel and Brent was at $73.07, up 0.79% on the day. Still, oil prices were set for a third straight week of losses after markets witnessed dramatic drops on fears of a weakening U.S. economy and slowing Chinese demand.  [ 2023-05-05 06:58:55]

[Dr. Techy| What if Elon Musk invested OpenAI instead of Twitter?,;,; Elon Musk, one of the richest men in the world, has seen two companies he‚Äôs played a big role in‚ÄîTwitter and OpenAI‚Äîhead in two very different directions.  &amp;#x200B;    Just one month before Microsoft-backed OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT revived popularity of artificial intelligence across the globe, Tesla‚Äôs CEO Elon Musk took the social media platform Twitter private with **$44 billion**¬†in late October. The largest social network suffered a steep drop in value ever since.   Twitter, to which Musk has been giving his all, is not wriggling out troubles. Musk even said that Twitter might go bankrupt. Although the remark was changed later, Twitter still involved too much energy from Musk. Musk now values Twitter at about **$20 billion**, halved compared with his buyout price, according to an internal email.  As for OpenAI‚Äîmaker of AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT‚ÄîMusk cofounded it and helped get it started in 2015 with a donation of about **$100 million**. After being rebuffed to take over the AI startup, Musk and his money walked away in 2018 and focused on electric vehicle business. And OpenAI soon succumbed to Microsoft‚Äôs **$1 billion**¬†embrace to cover operation costs.  This year, Microsoft upsized investment to **$10 billion**¬†(now **$13 billion**¬†in total) into the San Fancisco-based AI research company and pounced on the chance to integrate the AI tools into its products, like search engine Bing and Office suites. The new Bing Chat feature has put Microsoft‚Äôs search engine in the spotlight recently and hits over **100 million active users**¬†in bid to grab share from its rival Google. And Google is feeling the pressure and stepping up AI development.  Elon Musk calls Bill Gates' understanding of AI 'limited', but he has to admit Microsoft founder excels at investing.  &amp;#x200B;    **Musk out, Gates in.**  Musk left OpenAI in 2018, presumably because Tesla‚Äôs own A.I. work created a conflict‚Äîthough according to a Semafor report, it was actually because Musk offered to run OpenAI and was rejected by CEO Sam Altman and other founders.  Whatever Musk‚Äôs reasons were, OpenAI quickly underwent significant changes. In 2019, it transitioned from a nonprofit to a ‚Äúcapped-profit‚Äù model and received the first of several large investments from Microsoft, which helped it with the vast computing resources required for AI tools like ChatGPT.  The Microsoft-backed AI pioneer‚Äôs valuation has skyrocketed. According to the Wall Street Journal, the company was in talks earlier this year to sell existing shares in a tender offer valued at about **$29 billion**, up from about **$14 billion**¬†in 2021.  Along with divergence, OpenAI cofounders Sam Altman and Elon Musk have been increasingly sniping at one other. OpenAI is leading a **$23.5 million**¬†investment in 1X, a startup that creates human-like robots. And OpenAI's foray into robotics could put it in direct competition with Musk's Tesla, which has been promising to launch a bipedal, humanoid robot called the Tesla Bot or Optimus since mid-2021.  &amp;#x200B;    In response, Musk joined over 1,000 researchers and supporters in calling for an immediate pause on the creation of ‚Äúgiant‚Äù AIs for at least 6 months. His signature in the joint letter indicates that Tesla is lagging in the AI race and is attempting to catch up.  Initially, Musk had a different opinion about OpenAI's chatbot. Musk called ChatGPT "scary good" in a December tweet, adding that "we are not far from powerful and dangerous artificial intelligence."  Elon Musk intended to establish a new research lab to create a competitor to OpenAI's popular text-based chatbot. The lab's focus would be on AI research, with no immediate plans to develop specific products. Though it is never too late to start a business, Open AI has a head start. The Tesla and Twitter CEO has to face a massive technological "gap," which he will not be able to catch up with harsh words alone.  So, what will happen if Elon Musk didn‚Äôt pour money into Twitter deal but invested OpenAI? Dr. Techy believes, Mr. Musk will not lose his $20-plus billion in the social media platform valuation for nothing.  On 1994, Yahoo released searching engine. On 2007-2008, Apple released first iPhone and App Store. On 2023, [ChatGPT released plugin]( Third party service provider now can participate in the most powerful AI program,;,; 2023-03-30 12:31:54]
[The Bad Economics Of The Audio Streaming Industry (Spotify Example),;,; Hey everyone, before I share with you my thoughts on Spotify, I thought it might be a good idea to share a famous quote from Warren Buffett, which I think applies to the audio streaming market: *'When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact'.*  This posts breaks down:  * Overview of Spotify * Economics of the Audio Streaming Business * Why I think its bad economics for investors  # Spotify Overview:   Spotify is one of the world‚Äôs most popular audio streaming subscription service giving access to over 100 million tracks and 5 million podcasts to millions of members. Spotify is the leader in the audio streaming market with a market share of 30.5% and Spotify has been growing their premium subscribers every year with no signs of slowing down.  *Premium Subscribers (In Millions)*  |**2015**|**2016**|**2017**|**2018**|**2019**|**2020**|**2021**|**2022**|**2023 (2Qs)**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |92|154|244|341|445|567|675|770|*430\**|  In 2022, the global audio streaming market was around $34 billion. The audio streaming market is expected to grow to over $100 billion by 2030 according to research and markets. Despite Spotify's growth and the growth of the industry at large, the economics of Spotify and other businesses in this market doesn't appear to be looking good at all and in my opinion I don't see signs of improvement. I will explain the economics of the industry a little below but I will first present revenue and profitability in years 2015 &amp; 2022:  *Revenue (In Millions)*  |**2015**|**2022**| |:-|:-| |$1,940|$11,727|  *Profitability (In Millions)*  |**2015**|**2022**| |:-|:-| |($235)|($689)|  Although I only present these two years, operating losses for this company has been consistent in all years between this period. Someone has to cover the cost of the money losing operations of Spotify and it looks as if shareholders has been footing the bill. Shares outstanding has been increasing.  Shares outstanding:  |**2015**|**2022**| |:-|:-| |141,946,000|195,846,362|  I believe Spotify can continue to grow revenue but I think the path to profitability is no where near in sight. Looking more closely into the economics of the audio streaming business, it appears that Spotify **doesn't have a moat** and I don't think any competitor can gain an advantage in this industry.  # Economics of the Audio Streaming Business   There are certain rules in this industry that prevent any company from gaining any real advantage from another. The audio streaming business is subject to a ‚Äòmost favored nation clause‚Äô, which sounds complicated but it essentially means that audio streaming providers such as Spotify is in some ways restricted from negotiating exclusive deals with artists. Let‚Äôs say Spotify has agreed to a deal with a music publisher at $10,000, and this deal contains a most favoured nation clause, if another publisher comes in and agrees to a $15,000 deal with Spotify, then Spotify will have to pay the same amount to first publisher. For example, let‚Äôs say Spotify signed an agreement that gives it permission to stream **The Weeknd** ***(which is the most listened artist on Spotify)*** on its platform. And this agreement contains a MFN clause. The way this works is that Spotify will need to pay royalties to the Universal Music Group, which is the Weeknd‚Äôs publisher, every time a song is played on its platform. The Royalty rates are set by the Copyright Royalty Board which establishes the minimum rate a streaming service has to pay their artists. If Spotify signs a new agreement with **Rihanna,** and Spotify pays Rihanna's publisher (Sony/ATV) a higher amount to stream her songs on the platform, then Spotify will have to pay the difference to the Weekend Publisher because of the clause agreement. This applies to other audio streaming services such as Apple Music, Youtube Music, etc.  # Why this is bad economics for Spotify investors    **Reason 1:** Since it is in the best interests of music artists to go after those MFN agreements; this really prevents any audio streaming service from signing exclusive deals with music artists that prevent from being streamed on other platforms. It is also the goal of a music artist to promote their music as far and as wide as possible and be to paid the maximum amount, and to do that, any major artist, or any artist in general will also have similar agreements with other streaming platforms, giving none of these platforms any competitive advantage. ***This is very different from video streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, who has their own production studio and exclusive rights to TV shows and movies.***  **Reason 2:** As someone who likes listening to music, it really doesn‚Äôt bother me what platform I use, as long I can listen to the music I like. So I really struggle to find any competitive advantage Spotify has and because of that, I‚Äôm not really sure if Spotify can maintain its position in the market without spending an excessive amount. And from what we have already seen, Spotify is already struggling to keep its costs down so achieving a sustainable level of profits in the future is very hard to predict.  **Reason 3:** Competition. Since the audio streaming market is huge and is expected to grow, this will attract new competitors into the market. Without a competitive advantage (other than a well-known brand - not very durable) Spotify will likely need to increase their costs further in the future to maintain and protect its market share of 30.5%. If more competitors enter the market, then Spotify will need to increase marketing costs to attract new consumers, this expense may increase by a lot. Since Spotify is a technology company, research and development costs will need to continually increase, since old and new competitors will be investing to improve their audio streaming service so they take market share from Spotify. Another problem is pricing. Let‚Äôs imagine a new competitor enters the market and sells their streaming service at a lower price than Spotify. Spotify will then need to reduce its subscription costs to prevent their members from cancelling their membership and signing up with a competitor.  Those are my thoughts on Spotify and the economics of the audio streaming business. As a consumer and a lover of music, we gain the benefit of competition. However, I think the consumer benefit will continue to come at the expense of shareholders. Of course, I could be wrong. Please share your thoughts on Spotify and whether you agree or disagree with my review, I welcome any discussion :)  Hope everyone is enjoying their day.,;,; 2023-11-02 13:05:22]
[Dow Jones rises but leaders tumble, and Tesla ($TSLA) stock triggers the sell rule.,;,;  Dow Jones futures were little changed early Thursday, along with S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The stock market rally struggled Wednesday as weak economic data raised recession fears for a second straight session.    The major indexes still don't look too bad, with the Nasdaq sliding but the Dow Jones rising.  But once again, declining stocks decisively beat winners. Once again, many of those losers fell hard. But on Wednesday, a lot of more of those big losers were leading stocks, such as **On Holding** ($**ONON**), **MarketAxess** ($**MKTX**) and **PagerDuty** ($**PD**). **C3.ai** ($**AI**) sold off for a second session, with the AI stock now staging a massive, outside week to the downside.  Others, including many chip names, declined solidly, now showing more chart damage after relatively modest retreats Tuesday.  **Tesla** ($**TSLA**) skidded for a third straight day, triggering the automatic sell rule.   Megacap techs such as **Apple** ($**AAPL**), **Microsoft** ($**MSFT**), Google parent **Alphabet** (**GOOGL**), **Meta Platforms** ($**META**) and **Nvidia** all fell.  Meanwhile, bank stocks came under more pressure. **Western Alliance Bancorp** (**WAL**) plunged, leading a retreat in regional banks, though they pared losses in the afternoon. **Charles Schwab**hit a two-year closing low. While bank deposits may be relatively safe, the bigger issue now may be long-term bank profitability as well as lending curbs that rapidly slow the economy.  Medical names are looking relatively strong, along with other defensive growth or defensive plays.  PagerDuty stock, On Holding, Meta and Nvidia are on **IBD Leaderboard**. Microsoft and Google stock are on the **IBD Long-Term Leaders** list.   Despite relatively benign action in the major indexes, the weakness in growth and other leading stocks is concerning. Investors should be looking to protect profits and cut losses.  ## Costco Sales Weak  Costco same-store sales fell 1.1% in March vs. a year earlier, the first decline in nearly three years. U.S. comps slid 1.5%. Excluding gasoline and currency effects, comps rose 2.6% or 0.9% in the U.S. E-commerce comps tumbled 11.6%. COST stock fell modestly.  ## Dow Jones Futures Today  Dow Jones futures edged higher vs. fair value. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 0.2%.  The Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. That follows unexpectedly weak February job openings and the March ADP Employment Report. Labor will release the March jobs report on Friday morning, but U.S. markets will be closed.   ## Stock Market Rally  The stock market rally had a generally negative session, despite the mixed action on the major indexes.  The ADP Employment Report showed private payrolls rose much less than expected in March, a day after a big drop in February job openings. The March ISM services index fell more than expected, signaling rapidly slowing growth.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2% in Wednesday's **stock market trading**. The S&amp;P 500 index dipped 0.25%. The Nasdaq composite retreated 1.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 gave up 1%.  U.S. crude oil prices dipped 0.1% to $80.61 a barrel.  The 10-year Treasury yield declined 5 basis points to 3.285%. That's the lowest point in nearly seven months. The 2-year Treasury yield sank 7 basis points to 3.76%, off 34 basis points in the past four sessions.  ## ETFs  Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF ($**FFTY**) shed 1.9%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF ($**BOUT**) gave up 0.65%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF ($**IGV**) slipped 1.3%. Microsoft stock and a few other heavyweights dominate IGV, while more-speculative software names like PagerDuty suffered bigger losses. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF ([**SMH**]( gave up 1.75%, with NVDA stock a major holding.  Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF ($**ARKK**) slumped 3.6% and ARK Genomics ETF (**ARKG**) shed 1.8%. TSLA stock is the top holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. Some Ark funds also own PD stock.  SPDR S&amp;P Metals &amp; Mining ETF (**XME**) retreated 1.15% and the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (**PAVE**) 1.7%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (**JETS**) and SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF (**XHB**) descended 1.5%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (**XLE**) climbed 1.5% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (**XLV**) rallied 1.7% to its best level since Feb. 14.  ## Bank Stocks  The Financial Select SPDR ETF (**XLF**) edged down 0.1%, with SCHW stock a top 10 holding. The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (**KRE**), which includes WAL stock, sank 1% but finished off lows.  Western Alliance stock plunged as much as 19.4% after releasing some financial metrics but not disclosing deposits. Shares came off their lows as the California-based bank disclosed deposits fell 11% on March 31 vs. the end of 2022, not as bad as some feared. Still, WAL stock closed down 12.4%.,;,; 2023-04-06 11:23:50]

[Will Tesla go up (a): a comprehensive understanding of Tesla,;,; At dinner, my children's relatives in the securities company said to me, Tesla has gone up a lot!  &amp;#x200B;  I said, "Tesla will go up again.  &amp;#x200B;  Then, he looked at me with a puzzled face.  &amp;#x200B;  At that time, I had been studying Tesla for a week and was about to finish.  &amp;#x200B;  So, I was still sure about this conclusion.  &amp;#x200B;  Why did I dare to say that?  &amp;#x200B;  Of course, it starts with understanding Tesla -  &amp;#x200B;    &amp;#x200B;  Tesla's businesses are: electric vehicles, energy storage, solar energy, etc.  &amp;#x200B;  Among them, according to the financial data of Q4 22: total revenue of 24.3 billion, 21.3 billion ($) in automotive revenue, accounting for 87.65%.  &amp;#x200B;  And, Tesla electric car price cuts swept the world.  &amp;#x200B;  So, of course, we have to start our research with electric cars.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Here, to say one of my preconceived ideas when I started my research -  &amp;#x200B;  I always thought that Tesla selling cars is just a layout, like a big game, through the sale of cars to self-driving FSD software services to thousands of households is its ultimate goal.  &amp;#x200B;  After all, the software subscription and FSD gross margin straight up to 90%.  &amp;#x200B;  Currently Tesla's main revenue from electric vehicles is through the model series, as well as electric trucks and electric pickups.  &amp;#x200B;  In the future, Tesla is expected to launch a $10w class of electric vehicles to capture the low-end market and increase market share.  &amp;#x200B;  According to the distribution of Tesla's global revenue, it is as follows.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Currently it is dominated by the United States market, which is almost a clean sweep.  &amp;#x200B;  The Chinese market is growing rapidly and has become Tesla's second major battleground, but to be honest, it is also the strongest smoke and mirrors.  &amp;#x200B;  Of course, although the auto market is a competitive place, new energy vehicles are undoubtedly full of promise.  &amp;#x200B;  Although, a while ago, the epidemic led to a downturn in consumption, but the policy -  &amp;#x200B;  on the one hand, China's and the world's carbon-neutral carbon summits have continued to make new energy look good.  &amp;#x200B;  On the other hand, Shanghai continues to subsidize the replacement of new energy vehicles, giving 1W financial subsidy for replacement - may be the national wind vane to promote new energy.  &amp;#x200B;  At the same time, Musk also offered up his big killers: price cuts.  &amp;#x200B;  Outsiders see the fun, insiders see the doorway.  &amp;#x200B;  Behind this is still because of Tesla's scale advantage, and in the entire automotive industry unmatched \[high gross profit\].  &amp;#x200B;  Tesla's price reduction magic weapon, spread out to see, there are.  &amp;#x200B;  4680 large cylindrical battery technology, super factory, integrated die-casting technology automotive design (compressed inventory turnover days), parts supply localization, and the industry's Moore's Law + Wright's Law.  &amp;#x200B;  Note: These technologies will be explained in detail later in the article.  &amp;#x200B;  All this makes both traditional car companies and new car makers look beyond their reach.  &amp;#x200B;  Even the most responsive market "electric three idiots" -  &amp;#x200B;  Xiaopeng gross profit margin of 12.2%, Azera 13.6%, the ideal maximum 18.9%.  &amp;#x200B;  And in the first three quarters of 2022 operating losses Azera 8.9 billion yuan, Xiaopeng 6.2 billion yuan, the ideal 3.5 billion yuan.  &amp;#x200B;  And Tesla's gross margin, even with price cuts, has always been controlled at more than 25% -  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  So, he still has the bottom of the price cut.  &amp;#x200B;  Thus, looking around, Tesla's competitors seem to be left with BYD.  &amp;#x200B;  About who is competing with BYD to the next article, here is a brief summary of Tesla and my concerns so far.  &amp;#x200B;  Tesla's previous strategy is: high-end sports car cut into the market, and then take the market through model 3 mass production.  &amp;#x200B;  This is undoubtedly the right thing to do.  &amp;#x200B;  In the future, Tesla may want to sell cars to occupy the terminal, and then through software subscriptions and other Apple-like model long bound users - all this is happening, but the ultimate feasibility has yet to be verified.  &amp;#x200B;  While Tesla has seen its stock and sales rise in tandem by cutting prices, at the same time, Tesla's market share is declining year after year, both globally and in China and the United States.  &amp;#x200B;  Tesla's main rival in China, BYD, has seen its market share rise from 19.5% in 2021 to 31.7%, while Tesla's market share has fallen from 10.7% to 7.8% over the same period, according to data from the Passenger Association. .  Tesla's U.S. market share 79% (20 years), 71% (21 years), 65% (22 years Q3).  S&amp;P Global Automotive forecasts that by 2025, the number of U.S. electric vehicle models is expected to increase from the current 48 to 159, and Tesla's electric vehicle market share will fall to below 20%.  Perhaps, Tesla can control its gross margin, but market share is up to itself, its competitors and most importantly, user demand, can Tesla continue to occupy the public mind?  &amp;#x200B;  At the same time, although the price cut boosted sales at the moment, but the loss is the company's long-term competitive advantage and brand reputation.  &amp;#x200B;  For example, due to Tesla price cut old users rights, and the original high-end customer base are embarrassed to drive Tesla, instead of driving their old Mercedes-Benz or old BMW ......  &amp;#x200B;  Suddenly remembered Reid Hoffman in the "lightning expansion" there is a sentence -  &amp;#x200B;  The so-called entrepreneurship is the process of falling off a cliff in the rapid formation of parts into an aircraft that can be lifted.  &amp;#x200B;  The sense of urgency in this jumped off the page.  &amp;#x200B;  And Tesla, despite its nearly 20-year history, is still running rapidly, in order to continue to leave the competition, in order to replace the existing car ownership market of more than a billion, in order to Musk's "use of clean energy to continue human development" retroactive ......  &amp;#x200B;  That's all for today's analysis. Your attention is the biggest motivation for my daily progress. If you have any questions or questions about the stock market, please add a friend to my private message to ask, I am Amy, thank you for your support.,;,; 2023-03-19 02:05:00]

[Unity Software Analysis_1,;,; &amp;#x200B;  [ Games made with Unity ](  Before analyzing Unity, I think it is better to make a simple explanation of the game engine and Unity's business.   At first, game development was bundled with a game machine. If you want to develop a game, you must start with the machine design. After, the software development is separated from the hardware, independent game developers can focus on game development. To make the game look real, the developer needs to build a visual world with similar physics and light effects to the real world through coding, and those models coded almost needed by every game, it named as game engine, a set of universal software to create digital content simulate physic and light effects in real world and add functions in them. Unity is a company to provides this kind of software that can support game developers to create 2D or 3D content, like characters, buildings, or nature objectives, and provide run and monetize services meanwhile.      [ Unity business ](     **Business**   Unity has two segments with high correlation. The first is Create Solutions, which is its popular game engine combined with a set of software tools for Real-Time 2D&amp;3D content creation in multiple platforms, most of which are acquired by Unity. Unity's engine becoming popular with mobile devices and games explosion. We can see most games made with Unity are mobile living games, like Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, COD Mobile, and Honor of Kings. Those games earned money mainly through purchases inner App or subscriptions, not a one-off fee like 3A video games. This defined a high correlation with Unity's Grow Solutions. After many acquisitions, Unity added many useful tools to its software platform, like DevOps, which can let developers process scales idea model tests, and Pixyz, which can proceed with CAD files, helping Unity expand its product use in other industries. I think this is important for Unity to achieve its long-term 30% annual growth goal.    The second business is Grow Solutions, this is a service package open for every developer, even if you didn't make content with Unity. Unity provides a lot of marketing tools that help developer test their apps and access users, and the ad auction platform can help them sell the ad space in their game to advertisers. This business created a special advantage of working capital management as Unity can use the money from advertisers to run its business through the management of turnover of AR and AP. In recent years, Unity has kept developing its living game services for studios, like team coordination, user management, and game hosting. Those businesses are included in Grow Solutions.   Unity is promoting a cross-selling model between two segments and strengthening their integration, I believe that Unity will keep two units but development as a whole.   Unity got money from seat-based subscription fees in Create Solutions and from revenue or profit-shared commission in Grow Solutions. The key metrics for Unity's success are user retention, user expenditure expansion, and new user growth. I think the future for Unity is bright because   1) its engine product has many users and dominates mobile game development, which is the    highest growth sector in the video game industry and for the first time is the largest sector in 2023. This will give a growth foundation for Unity;   2) its product portfolio has no competitive switch options. Unity's engine product is simply to be used for universal indies and different-size studios and support AR/VR content creation. Compared to other engine providers, Unity has built a strong ad and monetized platform for apps after acquiring ironSource.   3) Unity has strong big clients and supporters internationally, like Apple, Tencent, Mihoyo, and Sequoia Capital, which give stable business and funding to Unity.   4) after the storm caused by the revision of the fee model, Unity lost its leader, John, and the current temporary CEO and board are processing a review of Unity's product portfolio and cutting expenses, which may promote Unity to achieve breakeven in operating profit. I think Unity will focus on game and industry sectors and enhance its advancement in AR creation, AI integration, living game services, and ad platforms.  &amp;#x200B;  [ Revenue and profit growth ](     **Growth**   Unity's revenue growth declined in the recent two years, breaking up its management's 30% annual growth guidance. The reason for the decline is the low growth of Create Solutions. Unity attributes this decline to the slowdown of the whole gaming market compared with the Covid period and especially Chinese mobile game market growth stagnated. I think this is dangerous for Unity because low growth means declining new uses or user spending on the platform, which is the foundation of Unity's valuation, more important than margins. The 2023 TTM revenue growth of 46% is driven by the ironSource acquisition and the increase in Grow Solutions. The operating margin is becoming better as the Unity team finally realized that some of their investment in R&amp;D and technical acquisition didn't generate high ROI. The capital market always tells stores, that if high growth does not persist, they must accelerate their speed to earn a positive margin, especially in the high rising cost period. This is what Unity's management does.   I think the potential Fed's cutting will benefit Unity's valuation and the mobile gaming market and new industry entered will refuel the growth of Unity in the future, so Unity can be an opportunity if it can achieve the client base synergy in the ironSource acquisition and improve growth in Create Solutions.  &amp;#x200B;  [ Operation metrics ](     **Operating**   Unity provides two useful metrics to access their business operations. The first is Customers Contributing More than 100k, this number keeping high growth and a little slowdown in 2022 and 2023 if not conclude the acquisition. I think this is good because this means Unity still has a strong attraction for new users.   The second one is the Dollar-based net Expansion Rate, which is a ratio of the same users' spending in this period to the last period. This is an important ratio for SAAS company to supervise their product performance. Generally, this ratio exceeding 80% is modest, exceeding 100% is good, and exceeding 120% is great. I saw Unity's ratio crashed in 2021 and kept declining in the last two years and may be below 100% this year. This is the reason why Unity's revenue growth declined. They can't promote user spending more on their platform. One reason is the spending slowdown of the big client and the whole market, but Unity still has failures with their product and tools, like frequent updates and inaccuracies of ad targeting tools, which increase the cost of the customers.   Now Unity wants to re-focus on its high-value product portfolios, I hope the new management can keep the product at an advanced role in the gaming industry and compete in other new areas, which can help increasing in users and expansion rate.  &amp;#x200B;  [ Margins and cash conversion cycle ](     **Profit**   Unity has not profit, the data shows bad margins and some good cash flows. Unity's gross margin is high, similar to its peers. The gross margin declined with the acquisition of ironSource. The operating margin keeps declining as high-level spending on R&amp;D, overheads, and acquisitions. The free cash flow is better than margins, and it's positive in the 2023 TTM. Unity has enough money to run its daily business, the secret is cash conversion. Unity will get money from subscribers and advertisers first, then provide services and ad revenue to its customers. If I added the payable ad fees owned by Unity to its payable turnover, the cash conversion cycle becomes -155 days, although improving from 2018, this can give Unity an advantage to use the customers, actually ad space suppliers' money to run its business. The other reason to improve cash flow is stock compensation, I calculate the issue price is around $110. Which is great? Maybe for management, but did not add much value for investors considering the offset of the dilution.   The good thing is I can see all margins improving recently, because of the review of the company's strategy. This is similar to PayPal, which moves from high user growth to maximum margins, but they will pay much from their market cap.   &amp;#x200B;  [ Revenue quality and dilution problem ](     **Quality and Cash Flow**   Again, as a company with negative margins, Unity has low-quality revenue, especially in a slowdown of growth and a high interest rate period. Unity is an expert in managing its cash flow, and most expenses are paid by stock at around $110. But there generated another problem for shareholders, the dilution. I noticed Unity has proceeded with a $2.5b share repurchase plan using money from convertible notes with low interest. This note has a call option that covers all shares that can be convertible. This method can reduce the effect of dilution by issuing many shares for acquisition and expense payment, and Unity may achieve a stable equity structure after it cuts more expenses and acquisitions.  &amp;#x200B;  [ Investment and equity returns ](     **Return**   Unity has negative returns, but all return ratio's trend is positive. Anyway, Unity must prove its business can achieve a positive return for the investors finally.  &amp;#x200B;  [ Asset stability ](     **Asset**   Unity's AR and Long-term fixed assets are stable, but intangible assets increased much in recent years because of increased goodwill from frequent acquisitions. Many technical acquisitions are essential for Unity to keep its product in advance in competition. I think the high intangible asset increase weakens its balance sheet. Now, that Unity is in reviewing its product portfolio, Unity may write off some goodwill in the future and negative to profit.  &amp;#x200B;  [ Capital structure and solvency ability ](     **Capital Structure**   Unity's debt level jumped as it issued Note 2026 of $1.5b and Note 2027 of $1b. Those convertible notes with easy interest burden and a high convertible price. Unity's insolvency risk looks high with low organic free cash flows, but I don't have much concern with that because the debt has 2 years to maturity, and Unity can refinance from its big investors and it achieved positive free cash flow.  &amp;#x200B;  [ Valuation multiples ](     **Valuation**   I got the $14.5 share price through the DCF model. I think the DCF model is not a good one to calculate the valuation for high-growth companies with negative margins, because many assumptions will change in a short time and the result can not well explain the market price. The growth stock is most like merchandise combined with special characters, its price defined by investors' demand and appetite.   The stage judgment and comparison valuation method may be more accurate. Unity now entered into a new stage to prove its business can combine growth and profitability. This stage doesn't have high valuation multiples compared with its history.   I see Unity's PS and PB multiples decline much and below its average line, which means Unity has paid off for its slowdown in growth. I cannot confirm this is a fair valuation without compare with its competitors, but I see its price stable at $25-$40 in the last 2 years.       **Conclusion**   Unity is like a growing kid, has an amazing product used by universal users. Although Unity's old strategy is failing and is highly uncertain in profitability and balance sheet, it makes me impressed with its cash management and market shares in the game-developing market. I think it is an opportunity for some investors with high-risk tolerance to consider many catalysts in the next year, including solid growth in mobile gaming, in which Unity has high permeability, a new strategy released by new management, expense discipline, and the potential interest rate cut.   I will do a comparison next to analyze if Unity has advanced in its product and financials.,;,; 2024-01-17 11:40:17]
[(4/3) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,;,; # Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/StockMarket sub! Welcome to the new trading week, month and quarter and a fresh start!

Chevron is set to give the index a boost as it gained 4.5% in pre-market trading on the spike in oil prices. ***** &gt; The output cut from OPEC+, which is slashing 1.16 million barrels per day, sent oil prices soaring. West Texas Intermediate crude was 6.6% higher, while international benchmark Brent crude climbed 6%. ***** &gt; Traders are shedding optimism from recent market strength with the prospect of higher oil prices adding to fears of higher inflation and a looming recession. ***** &gt; The Energy Select Sector SPDR fund (XLE), which tracks the S&amp;P 500 energy sector, also popped more than 3% in the premarket. Marathon Oil and Halliburton were the fund‚Äôs best performers, rising more than 6% each. ***** &gt; All three major averages were positive in the first quarter, despite turmoil in the banking sector highlighted by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March.

[Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023,;,; Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)  Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 27th, 2023.  # **Stocks close higher Friday as investors try to shake off latest bank fears: Live updates - [(Source)]( ***** &gt; Stocks rose Friday, reversing their earlier session declines as Deutsche Bank shares pared back some losses. ***** &gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 132.28 points, or 0.41%, closing at 32,238.15. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.57%, while Nasdaq Composite ticked up 0.3%. The major indexes all had a winning week, with the Dow gaining 0.4% week-to-date as of Friday afternoon, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq gained 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively. ***** &gt; Deutsche Bank‚Äôs U.S.-listed shares slid 3.11% Friday, rebounding from a 7% drop earlier in the trading session. A selloff of shares was triggered after the the German lender‚Äôs credit default swaps jumped, but without an apparent catalyst. The move appeared to raise concerns once again over the health of the European banking industry. Earlier this month, Swiss regulators forced a UBS acquisition of rival Credit Suisse. Deutsche Bank shares traded off their worst levels of the session, which caused major U.S. indexes to also cut their losses. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúI think that the market overall is neither frightened nor optimistic ‚Äî it‚Äôs simply confused,‚Äù said George Ball, president at Sanders Morris Harris. ‚ÄúThe price action for the last month-and-a-half, including today, is a jumble without any direction or conviction.‚Äù ***** &gt; Ball added that Deutsche Bank is ‚Äúvery sound financially.‚Äù ***** &gt; ‚ÄúIt could be crippled if there‚Äôs a big loss of confidence and there‚Äôs a run on the bank. There is, however, no fundamental reason why that should occur, other than nervousness.‚Äù ***** &gt; European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde tried to ease concerns, saying euro zone banks are resilient with strong capital and liquidity positions. Lagarde said the ECB could provide liquidity if needed. ***** &gt; Investors continued to assess the Fed‚Äôs latest policy move announced this week. The central bank hiked rates by a quarter-point. However, it also hinted that its rate-hiking campaign may be ending soon. Meanwhile, Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that credit conditions have tightened, which could put pressure on the economy. ***** &gt; On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said regulators are prepared to take more action if needed to stabilize U.S. banks. Her comments are the latest among regulators attempting to buoy confidence in the U.S. banking system in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank closures. ***** &gt; ‚ÄúRetail [and] institutional investors are both looking at the banking system, but now internationally. That‚Äôs dangerous,‚Äù Ball added. ‚ÄúBanks exist because of confidence in their stability, and that confidence can be eroded as we now see, via social media and technology in a matter of minutes.‚Äù  *****  # **This past week saw the following moves in the S&amp;P:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&amp;P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&amp;P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Indices for this past week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](  # **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](  # **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](  # **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **S&amp;P Sectors for the Past Week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  # **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades &amp; Downgrades:** ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](   *****  &gt; # Best and Worst Stocks Since the COVID Crash Low  &gt; We are now three years out from the COVID Crash low, and even with the past year's weakness, most assets continue to sit on solid gains. For major US index ETFs, the S&amp;P Midcap 400 (IJH) is up the most having slightly more than doubled while the S&amp;P Smallcap 600 (IJR) is not far behind having rallied 95.9%. Value has generally outperformed growth, especially for mid and small-caps although that has shifted somewhat this year. For example, while its gains have been more middling since the COVID crash, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has been the strongest area of the equity market in 2023 thanks to the strength of sectors like Tech (XLK) and Communication Services (XLC). Although those sectors have posted strong gains this year, they have been the weakest over the past three years while Energy (XLE) far and away has been the strongest asset class. Paired with the strength of energy stocks has been solid runs in commodities (DBC)more broadly with the notable exception being Natural Gas (UNG) which has lost over 40%. Bond ETFs are similarly sitting on losses since the COVID Crash lows. As for international markets, Mexico (EWW) and India (PIN) have outpaced the rest of the world although Emerging Markets (EEM) as a whole have not been particularly strong; likely being dragged on by the weaker performance of China (ASHR) which holds a large weight on EEM.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Taking a look at current S&amp;P 500 members, nearly half of the index has more than doubled over the past three years. As for the absolute best performers, Energy stocks dominate the list with four of the top five best-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks coming from that sector. Targa Resources (TRGP) has been the absolute best performer with a nearly 900% total return. Other notables include a couple of heavy weight stocks: Tesla (TSLA) and NVIDIA (NVDA) with gains of 563.9% and 412.9%, respectively.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; On the other end of the spectrum, there are currently 25 stocks that have posted a negative return since the COVID Crash low. The worst has been First Republic Bank (FRC) which has been more of a recent development. Whereas today the stock has posted an 83.1% loss, at the start of this month it would have been a 65% gain. Another standout on the list of worst performers has been Amazon (AMZN). Most other mega caps have more than doubled since the March 2020 S&amp;P 500 low, however, the e-commerce giant has hardly offered a positive return.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Sector Performance Experiences a Historical Divergence  &gt; The first quarter of 2023 is coming to a close next week, and checking in on year to date performance, there has been a big divergence between the winners and losers. Although the S&amp;P 500 is up 2.84% on the year as of yesterday's close, only three of the eleven sectors are higher. Not only are those three sectors up on the year, but they have posted impressive double digit gains only three months into the year. Of those three, Consumer Discretionary has posted the smallest gain of 10% whereas Technology and Communication Services have risen 17.2% and 18.1%, respectively. The fact that these sectors are home to the main mega cap stocks -- like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL), which have been on an impressive run of late -- helps to explain how the market cap weighted S&amp;P 500 is up on the year without much in the way of healthy breadth on a sector level.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; One thing that is particularly remarkable about this year's sector performance is just how rare it is for a sector to be up 10%+ (let alone 3) while all other sectors are lower. And that is for any point of the year let alone in the first quarter. As we mentioned in yesterday's Sector Snapshot and show in the charts below, going back to 1990, there have only been two other periods in which a sector has risen at least 10% YTD while all other sectors were lower YTD. The first of those was in May 2009. In a similar instance to now, Consumer Discretionary, Tech, and Materials were the three sectors with double digit gains back then. With those sectors up solidly, the S&amp;P 500 was little changed on the year with a less than 1% gain. As you can see below, though, by the end of 2009, every sector had pushed into positive territory as the new bull market coming out of the global financial crisis was well underway.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; The next occurrence was much more recent: 2022. Obviously, it was a tough year for equities except for the Energy sector which had a banner year. Throughout most of the year, the sector traded up by well over 20% year to date even while the rest of the equity market was battered.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # The Fed Expects Banking Stress to Substitute for Rate Hikes  &gt; The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 0.25% at their March meeting, bringing it to the 4.75-5.0% range. This is the ninth-straight rate increase and brings rates to their highest level since 2007. However, the most aggressive tightening cycle since the early 1980s, which saw them lift rates all the way from near zero to almost 5%, is near its end.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Up until early February, Fed officials expected to raise rates to a maximum of about 5.1% and hold it there for a while. However, since that time, we‚Äôve gotten a slew of strong economic data, including elevated inflation numbers. This pushed fed officials to give ‚Äúguidance‚Äù that they expected to raise rates by more than they estimated back in December.  &gt; Market expectations for policy also moved in conjunction. Prior to February, markets expected the Fed to raise rates to 5% by June, and subsequently lower them by about 0.5% by the end of the year. But strong incoming data and Fed guidance pushed expectations higher, with the terminal rate moving up to 5.6% and no cuts in 2023.  &gt; # The Silicon Valley Bank crisis changed everything &gt; The bank crisis that erupted over the last couple of weeks resulted in a significant shift, both in expectations for policy and now the Fed as well. See here for our complete rundown on SVB and the ensuing crisis.  &gt; Market expectations for Fed policy rates immediately moved lower. Markets expected the stress in banks to translate to tighter credit conditions, which in turn would lead to slower economic growth and lower inflation.  &gt; This was nicely articulated by Professor Jeremey Siegel, one of the foremost commentators on financial markets and fed policy, in our latest episode of the Facts vs Feelings podcast, Prof. Siegel said that tighter credit conditions, as lending standards become more strict, are de facto rate hikes.  &gt; Fed Chair Powell more or less said exactly the same thing after the Fed‚Äôs March meeting. The 0.25% increase was an attempt to thread the needle between financial stability and fighting inflation. Fed officials also forecast the fed funds rate to hit a maximum of 5.1%, unchanged from their December estimate. This is a marked shift from what was expected just a few weeks ago, with Powell explicitly saying that tighter credit conditions ‚Äúsubstitute‚Äù for rate hikes.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; # There‚Äôs a lot of uncertainty ahead &gt; While the recent bank stresses are expected to tighten credit conditions and thereby impact economic growth and inflation, there are a couple of open questions:  &gt; * How big will the impact be?  &gt; * How long will the impact last?  &gt; These are unknown currently. Which means future policy is also unknown.  &gt; Fed officials expect to take rates to 5.1%, i.e., one more rate increase. And then expect to hold it there through the end of the year. In short, they don‚Äôt expect rate cuts this year.  &gt; Yet investors expect no more rate increases and about 0.6% of rate cuts in the second half of 2023. Markets expect the policy rate in June to be at 4.8%, while expectations for December are at 4.2%.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; There‚Äôs clearly a huge gulf between what the Fed expects versus what investors expect. This will have to reconcile in one of two ways:  &gt; * Market expectations move higher ‚Äì if economic/inflation data remain strong and credit conditions don‚Äôt look to be tightening significantly.  &gt; * Fed expectations move lower ‚Äì if the banking sector comes under renewed stress, credit conditions could tighten significantly and eventually lead to weaker data.  &gt; Things are obviously not going to go in either direction in a straight line. It‚Äôs going to be a bumpy ride as new data points come in, not to mention news/rumors of renewed problems in the banking sector.  *****  &gt; # Seasonality Keeps Claims Below 200K?  &gt; Initial jobless claims remained healthy this week with another sub-200K print. Claims fell modestly to 191K from last week's unrevised reading of 192K. That small decline exceeded expectations of claims rising up to 197K. Given claims continue to impress, the seasonally adjusted number has come in below 200K for 9 of the last 10 weeks. By that measure, it has been the strongest stretch for claims since last April when there were 10 weeks in a row of sub-200K prints. Prior to that, from 2018 through 2020 the late March and early April period similarly saw consistent readings under 200K meaning that some of the strength in the adjusted number could be on account of residual seasonality.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; In fact, this point of the year has some of the weeks in which claims have the most consistently historically fallen week over week. Taking a historical median of claims throughout the year, claims tend to round out a short-term bottom in the spring before an early summer bump. In other words, seasonal strength will begin to wane in the coming months.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; While initial claims improved, continuing claims worsened rising to 1.694 million from 1.68 million the previous week. Albeit higher, that remains below the 2023 high of 1.715 million set at the end of February.  *****  &gt; # A Fed Day Like Most Others  &gt; Yesterday's Fed decision and comments from Fed Chair Powell gave markets plenty to chew on. As we discussed in last night's Closer and today's Morning Lineup, there have been a number of conflicting statements from officials and confusing reactions in various assets over the past 24 hours. In spite of all that uncertainty, the S&amp;P 500's path yesterday pretty much followed the usual script. In the charts below we show the S&amp;P's average intraday pattern across all Fed days since Powell has been chair (first chart) and the intraday chart of the S&amp;P yesterday (second chart). As shown, the market's pattern yesterday, especially after the 2 PM ET rate decision and the 2:30 PM press conference, closely resembled the average path that the market has followed across all Powell Fed Days since 2018.  &gt; The S&amp;P saw a modest bounce after the 2 PM Fed decision and then a further rally right after Powell's presser began at 2:30 PM. That initial post-presser spike proved to be a pump-fake, as markets ultimately sold off hard with a near 2% decline from 2:30 PM to the 4 PM close.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; So what typically happens in the week after Fed days? Since 1994 when the Fed began announcing policy decisions on the same day as its meeting, the S&amp;P has averaged a decline of 10 basis points over the next week. During the current tightening cycle that began about a year ago, market performance in the week after Fed days has been even worse with the S&amp;P averaging a decline of 0.99%. However, when the S&amp;P has been down over 1% on Fed days (like yesterday), performance over the next week has been positive with an average gain of 0.64%. As always, past performance is no guarantee of future results.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****   &gt; # What Now? An Update on Recent Bank Stress.  &gt; It‚Äôs been less than 2 weeks since Silicon Valley Bank‚Äôs stunning 48-hour collapse, and a few more banks have been caught in the fray. New York regulators closed the doors on Signature Bank on Sunday, March 12. A week later, US banks injected $30 billion into First Republic Bank to keep it afloat, and UBS acquired rival Swiss bank Credit Suisse in a government-brokered deal.

In fact, we think this event presents an opportunity to invest in the more stable large-cap financial companies and recently upgraded the sector to overweight in our House Views Advice.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; # Why is this happening? &gt; The rapid hike in interest rates caused an asset and liability mismatch for banks. Due to many years of low-interest rates, banks invested assets in interest-earning loans and bonds that would be repaid over the next five-plus years, which at the time was a logical way to earn a higher yield. Regulators considered government bonds to be among the safest ways a bank could invest its capital. As interest rates rose, bond values dropped. Interest rates rose at the fastest pace in history, and the safe assets that banks invested in lost value to the tune of more than $620 billion in unrealized losses as of the end of last year. This decline in value left weaker banks underwater and, when coupled with depositors pulling money out, caused them to collapse or seek costly capital raises.  &gt; # Why this matters to investors? &gt; The weakness in the banking sector will likely lead to tighter lending standards, potentially slowing economic growth. The reason we‚Äôre in this mess, to begin with, is that the Fed hiked interest rates to slow the economy because inflation was rising too quickly. Perhaps the 16% drop in oil prices over the past two weeks reflected this slower growth and bodes well for continued falling inflation. Thus, the Fed is closer to achieving its goal.  &gt; Maybe it‚Äôs an overreaction as ‚Äúbanking crisis‚Äù headlines stir painful memories of 2008. Either way, an environment with slower growth and lower inflation isn‚Äôt a bad time to invest. Bonds and stocks could both perform well, especially stocks of companies with the ability to grow earnings. We also reiterate our House Views Advice overweight on the large-cap Financials sector. The largest US banks are well-capitalized and are gaining market share from the smaller regional banks. We believe this calamity provides an opportunity for stronger banks and investors to capitalize on.  *****  &gt; # FANG+ Flying  &gt; As we noted in today's Morning Lineup, sector performance has heavily favored areas like Tech, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services in recent weeks. Playing into that sector level performance has been the strength of the mega-caps. The NYSE FANG+ index tracks ten of the largest and most highly traded Tech and Tech-adjacent names. In the past several days, that cohort of stocks is breaking out to the highest level since last April whereas the S&amp;P 500 still needs to rally 4% to reach its February high.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Although FANG+ stocks have been strong recently, that follows more than a full year of underperformance. As shown below, relative to the S&amp;P 500, mega-cap Tech consistently underperformed from February 2021 through this past fall. In the past few days, the massive outperformance has resulted in a breakout of the downtrend for the ratio of FANG+ to the S&amp;P 500.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; More impressive is how rapid of a move it has been for that ratio to break out. Below, we show the 2-month percent change in the ratio above. As of the high at yesterday's close, the ratio had risen 22.5% over the prior two months. That comes up just short of the record (22.6%) leading up to the pre-COVID high in February 2020. In other words, mega-cap Tech has experienced near-record outperformance relative to the broader market. However, we would note that this is in the wake of last year when the group had seen some of its worst two-month underperformance on record with the worst readings being in March, May, and November.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # March Seasonality Prevails, Banking Fiasco Be Damned  &gt; It‚Äôs encouraging typical March seasonal patterns have overcome recent bank failures, recession talk and fearmongering. The early March pullback was steeper than normal, but the usual mid-month rebound appears to be materializing.  &gt; Last week‚Äôs gains could be an indication we have seen the worst of the banking fallout and the end of the pullback. Triple Witching Weeks have tended to be down in flat periods and dramatically so during bear markets. Positive March Triple Witching weeks in 2003 and 2009 confirmed the market was back in rally mode.  &gt; The week after March Triple Witching is notoriously nasty. S&amp;P is down 27 of the last 40 year ‚Äì and frequently down sharply. Positive or flat action this week would be constructive.  &gt; In the old days March used to come in like a bull and out like a bear. Nowadays March has evolved into an inflection point where short-term trends often change course. The market is clearly at an important juncture and it‚Äôs a good time to remember Warren Buffet‚Äôs wise words to ‚ÄúBe greedy when others are fearful.‚Äù  &gt; Bank failures are never a good thing, but the swift actions of regulators likely prevented further damage to the industry. At the least, the banks are likely to be under even greater scrutiny going forward. In the near-term we expect more volatile trading. Further out we expect the market, and the economy will recover like they both have historically done.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  &gt; # Nasdaq Leaves the S&amp;P in the Dust  &gt; Looking at the major US index ETF screen of our Trend Analyzer shows just how disconnected the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has become from other major index ETFs recently. As shown below, as of Friday's close, QQQ actually finished in overbought territory (over 1 standard above its 50-DMA) whereas many other major index ETFs were oversold, some of those to an extreme degree. On a year to date basis, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has rallied more than 14% compared to low single digit gains or losses for the rest of the pack.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Historically, the major indices, namely the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, tend to trade at similar overbought and oversold levels. In the chart below we show the Nasdaq 100 and S&amp;P 500's distance from their 50-DMAs (expressed in standard deviations) over the past five years. As shown, typically the two large cap indices have seen similar albeit not identical readings. That is until the past few weeks in which the two have diverged more significantly.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; On Friday there was more than 2 standard deviations between the Nasdaq's overbought 50-DMA spread and the S&amp;P 500's oversold spread. As shown in the chart below, that surpassed recent highs in the spread like the spring of 2020 to set the highest reading since October 2016.  &gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  &gt; Going back to 1985, the spread between the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 50-DMA spreads diverging to such a degree is not without precedent, but it is also not exactly common. Friday marked the 16th time that spread eclipsed 2 standard deviations for the first time in at least 3 months. Relative to those prior instances, the current overbought and oversold readings in both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are relatively middling. However, only the instance in early 2000 similarly saw the Nasdaq technically overbought (trading at least a standard deviation above its 50-DMA) while the S&amp;P 500 was simultaneously oversold (at least one standard deviation below its 50-DMA).  *****  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending March 24th, 2023**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](  # **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3/26/23**  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())** (VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)  *****  Here are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-  *****  &gt; (*$CCL $BNTX $LULU $MU $IZEA $SKLZ $WBA $HTHT $FUTU $LOVE $RH $PAYX $IHS $GOEV $CALM $PLAY $RUM $CTAS $CNM $MKC $BB $EVGO $VERO $AUGX $RGF $GMDA $SNX $RAIL $AEHR $PVH $SRT $UGRO $AADI $PRGS $DNMR $NEOG $CONN $IMBI $SOL $LOV $GROY $EE $ABOS $CNXC $UNF $AMPS $JEF $ESLT $CURI $DARE*)  *****  ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!]( ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](  *****  &gt; # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.) **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).  &gt; #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](  *****  # DISCUSS!
