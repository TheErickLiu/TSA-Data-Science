[GOOGL April 19'24 $170 Calls - Up 100%... Thoughts?,;,; Trying to get a general idea of what others think of this play.  Currently up 123%. Swing traded a lot of contracts this week currently up $23k (INTC Puts, AMZN Calls, AMD Calls, and small trade on ARKB).  What do you think? Wait it out until post earnings next week, drop whole play now and pull the profit, or pull 50% off the table and let the gains run?  (I am inclined to the latter idea).  &amp;#x200B;    Edit: spelling*,;,; 2024-01-26 16:21:34]
[$GOOGL is going to $2T market cap.,;,; EDIT: Look at this:  It can learn to translate a new language just by feeding it a dictionary as context???  ------  Google just released this press release: [  Pretty insane if you ask me. They need much less compute now. 1M token context window is incredibly useful. They are the top of the world if it comes to AI research, a field that gets all the hype now. Googles AI alone will replace many jobs in every sector. Monetization plans are in place, so they know how to print $$ off of this.  I am a PhD student with not a lot of money. But, my private monthly expenses for google products are only going and I've been using Gemini with the free trial for work, it's nice. Not as good as GPT-4, but close. What is incredible about this is how fast Google is spitting out game-changing tech. Gemini is already best in speech-to-text. Gemini is really good at multimodal stuff and the long context token window makes it an incredible tool, see e.g.  [  Call me a fanboy if you want, but they have the most data and many brilliant minds, even though they lost some of them to other AI companies. Look:  [one month chart and future prediction](  See? Easy money.   I'm too scared to buy calls and don't even really know what they are. I think this is great long term. So my portfolio is now 100% google. Holding forever. I believe in the $2T market cap this year (not financial advice though).  Tl;dr: Gemini is a game changer. And the world is ready. ,;,; 2024-02-15 17:51:22]

[Hey $googl, thank you. ~400% gain one day. Holding longer.,;,; I am a huge google fan girl. Woke up yesterday morning and read the event schedule 2 hours before they went live. Decided they were probably going to clap back at $msft and went all in as a bull. I normally.am a bear so this felt pretty rare for me. Feeling good this morning. Cashed out 4k and I pushed out positions for longer. Expecting them to get to 130 personally.,;,; 2023-05-11 16:10:38]

[Is $GOOGL a great long-term buy now?,;,; Hello folks,  GOOGL  stock is now in a new dip at around $92.34. I already bought with avg  $96.5. I am planning to hold for long-term. Is it a good buy now? - considering the AI and supreme court challenges  My  portofolio is mostly tech stocks like: AMZN, MSFT, INTC, GOOGL. But  more than 50% is in GOOGL. I was planning to buy some stocks in AAPL too  and start investing in ETFs for diversification.  &amp;#x200B;  I just started in early January 2023 with intention for long-term holding stocks but would love to hear from you in this volatile market.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks!,;,; 2023-02-21 21:12:55]
[Google is done for....,;,; This quarter they only made 19.7 Billion USD in net income which is abysmally low for a company it's size. Despite their AI efforts and initiatives the past 6 months Microsoft is clearly eating their lunch with bing gaining ground on Google when it comes to search and overall ad revenue.   The 9.67% down day is completely justified due to Google cloud's dreadful growth which will be Google's unbecoming. Google ONLY made 8.42 billion dollars compared to 8.64 billion dollars expectation which can result into a going concern for bankruptcy. AI is not Google's strong suit and they have overpaid for YouTube sports which will net them no profits.   Overall tiktok and Microsoft will make Google obsolete as AI advanced and tiktok becomes the new YouTube for content creators and seekers of entertainment.,;,; 2023-10-26 02:01:24]
